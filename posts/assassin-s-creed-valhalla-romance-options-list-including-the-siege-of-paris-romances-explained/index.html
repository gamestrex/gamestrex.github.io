This page offers a list of romance options in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, as well as Wrath of the Druids romances for the DLC. Note - while most romances are there to add a little bit of flavour to Eivor’s time in England and beyond, but at least one has a considerable bearing on the story. As such, be wary of story spoilers in this article. We’ll keep the main one to the end of the last of romances just in case you want to preserve that for as long as possible. On this page: For more help with Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, we have pages on changing Eivor’s appearance, returning to Norway with the Atlas and some flyting tips. Romancing itself is fairly simple, and comes through clearly marked and easy to understand dialogue options - some are as blunt as someone coming up to you and outright asking if you’d like to have sex with them. The only dialogue options that matter are after you’ve been given a romantic proposition, where the romance option will have a clear heart symbol next to it. Some of the romance options are committed relationships, and if you are already in one, you will be able to tell a potential romantic suitor to let them down gently. Other options are just flings, and have no bearing on other relationships. Keep in mind that you can break up a permanent relationship at any time, so by permanent, we mean Eivor remains in the relationship after the cutscene, not that you are locked in and cannot experience any other romances. Some of these romances are missable after one rejection, others will hold a candle for you, so be careful about the choices you make if you want to see every tryst and turn. Finally, since you can change Eivor’s gender at any time from the game menu, these romances are not affected by gender. Bil Bil Romance requirement: Find her comb as part of the Comb of Champions world event in Rygjafylke You find Bil in the Rygjafylke mountains in Norway, with men on the lake in front of her, looking for her comb in the water. Find it, and Bil will be yours. Petra Petra Romance requirement: Build Hunter’s Shack in the settlement Build the Hunter’s Shack and complete the first quest Petra gives you. Afterwards, she will invite you for an archery contest, and ask you out at the end. Broder Broder Romance requirement: Liberate East Anglia Broder will ask if you want to have sex during Oswald’s wedding. Say yes. Gunlodr Gunlodr Romance requirement: Visit Asgard twice In the Asgard storyline, you will find Thor’s bridal circlet. You will be able to to give it to Gunlodr, triggering the romance. Stigr Stigr romance requirement: Win Hemthorpe’s Flyting duel. Stigr the Amorous, to give him his full title, is the Flyting extraordinaire of Snotinghamscire. If you impress him with your skillful tongue, you’ll get to… you know what? Let’s leave this to the imagination. This casual fling is as close as you can get to being a groupie in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, if you want Eivor to live a little. Tarben Tarben romance requirement: Build Bakery in the settlement. Once you build the Bakery, you’ll be able to talk to the baker, and go on a fishing trip with him. If this quest doesn’t appear, you may also need to build the Fishing Hut in your settlement. During this trip, he will tell you how he feels about you, and ask if you feel the same way. If you choose the option with the heart symbol, this will become your permanent relationship, breaking off any other established loves. Tewdwr Tewdwr romance requirement: Attend Tewdwr’s ealdorman celebrations. As part of the Glowecestre arc, Tewdwr will be drinking on the eve of him becoming ealdorman. During the festivities, he will flirt with Eivor, who can either opt for a romantic celebration (indicated by the heart symbol), or a platonic celebration where you chase chickens rather than sleep together. Tough choice. Neither of these choices influence the story, and the relationship will just be a casual fling. Vili Vili romance requirement: Liberate Snotinghamscire. Vili is the son of the Snotinghamscire Jarl, and is heavily involved in the Snotinghamscire arc. As it comes to a close, Vili will make his move, and you’ll be able to encourage him or lightly reject him. Either way, he will permanently move to Ravensthorpe afterwards, so whatever decision you make, you’ll probably see him again afterwards. Then again, he decides to make this move at a funeral, so Eivor is well within their rights to feel the timing might not be ideal. Sheer Reeve Stowe Stowe romance (?) requirement: Arrive in Lunden. Stowe, Lunden’s charismatic Sheer Reeve, appears at first to be a romance option. When you first meet him as you arrive in Lunden, you can flirt with him as you fight bandits by his side. However, this is as far as you’ll ever get: Stowe’s heart belongs to another. As you progress through his story, you’ll realise you can’t compete with his true love: Erke. Stowe’s codex entry, once complete, even reads “He saw the ruling of Lunden as a family, with Tryggr at the head as a father, Avgos as a brother, and Erke as something unlike either.” That leaves no room for Eivor, so you’ll have to sow your oats elsewhere. Randvi Randvi Romance requirement: Have a level 3 settlement Randvi will ask to go to Lunden with you once your settlement is level 3. Go with her, and tell her you feel the same way when she confesses she has affections for you. Note - Embarking on this relationship puts yours and Sigurd’s relationship at risk, which can affect how the story plays out based on your other choices with Sigurd throughout the game. That’s probably why in this expansion DLC there - from what we can tell at launch - only one romance option that Eivor can take a liking to; an Irish poetess that goes by the name of Ciara. Ciara Ciara romance requirement: Have the DLC expansion Wrath of the Druids and start the quest ‘Into the Fog’. Ciara is the poetess in King Flann’s court who you first meet in Dublin, Chapter 1. There is plenty of flirty dialogue between Eivor and Ciara, but only two options matter. The first is in ‘Foothold in Connacht’ where you can express you want to get closer to her, but she rebuffs you at the time. The second dialogue is in ‘Into the Fog’ where you can reject her obvious attempts to seduce you, or you can embrace them. This will initiate the romance scene. Ciara cannot be taken with you back to Ravensthorpe, and as such, will be treated like a fling. A shame, the tension is palpable! The new DLC is here - and we explain how to start The Siege of Paris, as well as new romance options and Treasure Hoard locations.\rIf you’re after end game activities in the full game, we can explain how to get Nodens’ Arc, Excalibur, Thor gear and other Valhalla armour sets, Power Level and how to get XP fast, Order of the Ancients locations and all Assassin’s Creed Valhalla story choices.\rIf you’re looking for things to collect and upgrade, we have lists on best skills and Book of Knowledge locations.\rOne of the guests who come to Ravensthorpe, Pierre, can eventually be romanced. The other visitor, Toka, cannot be romanced - even though she and Eivor become close allies. Pierre In order to romance Pierre you must have The Siege of Paris DLC and complete the main quests until you reach ‘Skal!’ It isn’t necessary to do any of Pierre’s resistance quests in order to unlock the romance. ‘Skal!’ is a party, so enjoy yourself however you like before heading over to Pierre. Pierre will be marked on the HUD because you have to talk to him to progress the story. Complete his cheese throwing challenge first. Then, you can flirt with him, offering to show him your other skills. Choose this option twice when they are available and you will get Pierre’s romance cutscene. Afterwards, Pierre will make it clear that this is a one time thing, and he won’t return to England with Eivor. Luckily, Eivor doesn’t seem too disappointed. For more help with Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, we have pages on changing Eivor’s appearance, returning to Norway with the Atlas and some flyting tips.\n","wordCount":"1451","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-18T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lee Loyd"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/assassin-s-creed-valhalla-romance-options-list-including-the-siege-of-paris-romances-explained/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Assassin S Creed Valhalla Romance Options List Including The Siege Of Paris Romances Explained</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 18, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1451 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Lee Loyd</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>Across the game, there&rsquo;s a range of different types of romances you can get involved in - from one-off flings to stable relationships, flirtatious friendships and deeply romantic love affairs.

The new DLC is here - and we explain how to start The Siege of Paris, as well as new romance options and Treasure Hoard locations.
If you&rsquo;re after end game activities in the full game, we can explain how to get Nodens&rsquo; Arc, Excalibur, Thor gear and other Valhalla armour sets, Power Level and how to get XP fast, Order of the Ancients locations and all Assassin&rsquo;s Creed Valhalla story choices.
If you&rsquo;re looking for things to collect and upgrade, we have lists on best skills and Book of Knowledge locations.
