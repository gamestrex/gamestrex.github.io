Bug Fixes Fixed collision problems across Caldera allowing players to catch and/or shoot through them. Fixed a problem allowing the access to items that Player didn’t have to see yet!\nWeapons Weapon Adjustments Many modifications have been made to Vanguard Weapons and Attachments. Nominations, description, pros, cons and stat bars have been updated in-game in order to reflect changes in that regard. There were several new weapon adjustments involving the Modern Warfare (MW) and the Black Os erroneous Cold War (BOCW). Assault Rifle\nAK-47 (BOCW) Early Recoil Deviation increased.\nWe don’t believe the AK-47 (BOCW) is imbalanced. Nevertheless, we want to stick to the Weapons that use a fast time to kill that maintains consistency with other reputable weapons.\nEM2 (BOCW): The neck-trained multiplier went down to 1,1, down from 1,212. The coronity of the air increased. Recoil fares increased.\nDespite its first attempt, the EM2 is dominating long-range engagement space with a remarkable level of influence. Generally, these can happen in cases where the Weapons Time to Kill potential isn’t met with adequate downsides. Slow-firing weapons like the EM2 (Body-Card) naturally give to more skilled players, whereas missed shots are a lot more detrimental to them. In the case of EM2, its mechanical output was not corresponding to its output. We have modified his Recoil behavior so that it will require more active Recoil countering. We also reduced its Neck Multiplier which will affect some of its realistic TTK breakpoints while remaining unchanged. Marksman Rifle\nCrossbow (MW) (crossbow) Neck damage increased to 250, from 200 to 250. The occurrence of a surge in Torso damage was at 240, compared to 200 in 2012. Torso damage increased by 20 points from 200.\nMarksman Rifle Charlie (MW) (MW) Finch Resistance has declined by six percent.\nThe Marksman, Rifle Charlie (MW) and the Swiss K31s (BOCW) have benefited very much from a reduced Flinch attribute, which has been completely exclusive to aggressive snipers for a long time. A significant reduction to their base Flinch Resistance will require some adaptation, as veteran snipers will find that they can no longer challenge Assault Rifles as consistently while sustaining fire in long-range engagements.\nR1 Shadowhunter (BOCW) The neck was lowered to 250, up from 200 to 250. In addition to 200 people, Upper Torso damage rose to 240, up from 200 to 200. The loss of Torso damage increased to 220, up from 200 to 200.\nThe crossbow (MW) and the R1 Shadowhunter (BOCW) haven’t received attention since they landed in the Warzone. We want to optimize their effectiveness, without on Caldera a big risk. Melee\nBallistic Knife (BOCW)) Upper Torso damage rose to 248, but 246 pounds. The lower Torso Damage had gone up to 225, up from 195. Last year’s damage for the upper arm increased to 200, from 180 to 180. Lower Arm Damage increased from 180 to 190. Upper Leg Damage increased to 200, up from 160. The lower leg injury rate decreased from 160 to 190 lbs.\nSimilar to the Crossbow and R1 Shadowhunter (BOCW), we have increasing the effectiveness of the Ballistic Knife (BOCW). A single piece of Tactical Equipment, with full intentions, can make an enemy within quick reach of the Upper Torso, generating an unexpected one-two punch.\nBaseball Bats (MOB) The length of the legs decreased by 47 %.\nBattle Axe (BOCW) Lunge distance has dropped by 38 %.\nCane (BOCW) Lunge distance has risen by 46.6%.\nMace (BOCW) Lunge distance sank by 42 %.\nDying to Killee Weapons can sometimes be wronged (and unfunned). A huge amount of damage and glare could damage several Melee Weapons over the edge. That’s why even fully-designed players can feel out-muscled in close quarters, but that doesn’t just mean to happen. Players miting Melee Weapons will be much less threatened now, since the misses rarely occur. Shotgun\nThe Japanese bombshell was launched against the Japanese bomb. The speed of movement has increased from 1,2 o’clock to 12,000. Slow movements in ADS decreased by 8,6 %.\nWith its inherent Mobilisation and generous magazine sizes, the Shotgun Bravo remained a force to reckon with, despite having received several changes in balance. Reducing the speed of the weapon Bravos (BOCW) is more susceptible to downsides than can be seen from the Weapons class. Without that mobility to close the gap into its deadly Maximum Damage Range, the Shotgun Bravo will become a more fair selection. Sniper Rifle\nBIB-States (Semitic) (K31). The fluff resistivity decreased by 62 %.\nSubmachine Gun\nOTs 9 (BOCW) The maximum damage has fallen to 30 to 31 %. Headshot Damage Multiplier fell to 1,33, down from 1,52.\nThe Japanese Aircraft Alpha (OPP) has fallen to a stoppage! Most damage increased to 20 o’clock. Headshot Damage Multiplier was down to 1.41, down from 1.45.\nThe abyss-sized pistol Charlie is a MW. Fire rate rose by 0.08 to 0.075, down from.075. The speed of fire by Sprint has increased by 2,6 %. Please note that these changes affect only Warzone.\nThe OTs nine has extended its wings for some time, and will never surprise anyone else. As a precaution, we will also adjust several guns that have been waiting around to take over once thrashed. While it’s sad to see our favorite Weapons take pride in their effectiveness, we feel that the pool of viable short-range Weapons will benefit from this anticipatory adjustment. Not to mention the imminent update will address Bloom and bring in weapons that include the PPSh-41 (VG).\nAttachments Attachment Adjustments Optic\nG16: 2,5x (VG) (G16), 3x (G18), +1,7x (G16), and V, 2x (G16), +1,7. Assault Rifles His eye’s position shifted forward.\nThe G16, 2,5x has become the preferred Optic cross Caldera. By shifting the direction towards the direction of the eye, we’re creating a greater area of magnification, which will help you find the most interesting place for a person. Stock\nRaiders can hold stocks (BBPC) Movement Speed moders decreased by 25 per cent.\nSAS Combat Stocks (BOCW)). Modifications of motion speed decreased by 25 %.\nWarzone is a live, breathing, ever changing game. This demands that we rethink the facts of the weapons only regularly, but, at times, that we give ourselves ample care to assess the actual game’s state in a holistic fashion. Games that progressively introduce content like Warzone’s are in danger of experiencing power creep. It’s important that we compress intermittently certain aspects of this game to a higher level of power, if we can exploit them and injure the greater balance. We believe that the large amount of content will a particularly nice time at which time we feel it is necessary to adapt the most powerful mobile Attachments of Warzone. The sheer existence of these Attachments greatly warps this category of Attachments for BOCW Weapons, but also requires that any future Weapon that intends to identify as highly mobile should recognize these values as a baseline. This is what forces the power levels to slowly rise over time, so that again a correction will have to be made. This change will not be last in addressing Weapon attributes that reach the ultimate power peak that need to be compressed to conserve our delicate ecosystem.
