Now, if it’s anything like the recent endeavour for PS5 stock and Xbox Series X stock we could be in for quite a struggle. However, as the Nintendo Switch OLED is only a very minor revision to existing hardware, it might not be as challenging to find where to buy it. Nevertheless, we’ll be using this page to bring you all the retailers who are stocking the Nintendo Switch OLED.\nNintendo Switch OLED White console (only) - £309 at Very Nintendo Switch OLED console - £309 at Argos Nintendo Switch OLED console - £309 at GAME\nWe’ll continue tracking the availability of both the White and Neon Red/Neon Blue models as soon as they are available to buy below. In the UK: In the US: Currently, we’ve spotted a new Nintendo Switch Carrying Case \u0026 Screen Protector which comes in the new white colour scheme and includes a pair of screen protectors. One is for the larger screen on the Switch OLED, while the other is for the standard Switch. You can find it at the retailers below: That’s still considerably cheaper than a PS5 or Xbox Series X - but a price increase compared to the original Switch does seem believable considering the upgrade to the OLED screen and the small improvements elsewhere. The specifics of that are detailed below. The new console also includes a wide adjustable kickstand. This is a significant improvement over the flimsy leg you can flick out of the existing Switch model, as it offers much more flexible viewing angles and a more secure stand for the console when undocked and in tabletop mode. Other new features include a new dock that comes with a wired LAN port to give you a more stable internet connection when playing in TV mode, enhanced onboard speakers for better audio and a bump to 64GB of internal memory for game storage. That can still be upgraded further with a Nintendo Switch SD card as your games library grows. While it’s not much, this is still more of a considerable upgrade to the existing Switch tech than the last iteration. The biggest difference there was improved battery life and slightly better Joy-Con controllers - though many did still suffer from drift. There’s no word on whether that’s been improved for the OLED Switch, but considering all existing Joy-Con controllers can be used with the console it doesn’t seem likely. For a more in-depth specification breakdown, you can visit the dedicated OLED Switch page from Nintendo. For all the rumours still floating around about the other suspected Nintendo hardware upgrade you can browse through our dedicated guide that covers all the rumoured Switch Pro features we’ve heard about so far. The first one is the screen. As explained above, the Switch OLED has a 7-inch OLED screen that outputs at 720p resolution. This is larger than both the 6.2 inch LCD on the current Switch and the 5.5 LCD screen on the Switch Lite, though the resolution remains the same. However, the OLED screen will offer improvements in other areas, such as higher contrast and overall better image quality. Even though there is a bump in screen size, it won’t increase the size of the overall console. Instead, the bezel (that’s the area between the screen and the edge of the system itself) will be made thinner. That means that all existing Joy-Con controllers will be supported by the OLED Switch console. That’s about it for the most impactful difference between the Switch models. Of course, the OLED Switch also has a few handy quality of life improvements such as the wider kickstand and 64GB internal memory (that’s double the 32GB in other models). And then there’s the enhanced audio in handheld mode, which is great if you play a lot away from the TV. Sadly, there’s no sign of the bump to 4K resolution that was rumoured with the Switch Pro model, so maybe it’s still worth holding off of picking up one of the best TVs for gaming until we hear something else about that - if we ever do! However, Nintendo has stated that “there may be differences in-game experience with some of the Toy-Con accessories in the Nintendo Labo series, due to differences in console and screen size between Nintendo Switch (OLED model) and Nintendo Switch”. Now, this doesn’t mean that those Labo games won’t work with the OLED Switch, but the larger screen could impact your experience with them. Just something to be cautious of if you use Labo a lot or will pick it up in the future. Many of the features included in reports about the Switch Pro have actually materialised on the OLED Switch - mostly notably the rumoured OLED screen. Apart from, of course, the big one - that is a jump to 4K resolution in TV mode through Nvidia’s DLSS technology. With the OLED Switch established, it would be reasonable to assume that Nintendo would eventually discontinue the existing Nintendo Switch model. The better screen and increased internal memory could eventually be positioned as the norm, with the Switch Lite fulfilling the role of the budget, handheld-only option. Still, that might present a good opportunity to nab yourself an incredible Nintendo Switch deal if the old console is also discounted to clear stock. Incredibly, it would be the first time the Nintendo Switch has been given a permanent price cut since launch. Previously, we’ve had to scrabble around for a Nintendo Switch Black Friday deal in order to find any significant savings. That might change in 2021! Hopefully everything we’ve covered here has got you prepared for when Nintendo Switch OLED! Do keep a close eye on this page for regular updates.
