Stats per map and mode The accuracy \u0026 progress of the weapons – namely, the tenest or most effective weapon/. The WZ rankings were 15 November 2021, 2021.\nTop 10 primary weapons in Vanguard are the most popular in the past year. Bear in mind that Vanguard doesn’t provide SMG data, so the top 10 weapons list doesn’t yet include a submachine gun. But COD Ranked confirmed that they’ll contact Sledgehammer Games to get the data. At the same time, a report can be added to the list by the time they go to date.\nEvery map classed from the worst to the best.\nHere are the top 10 primary weapons listed on COD according to their kill share.\n10. Double-barrel 3,1 %. Vanguard has a Shotgun meta, and double barrel Shotgun is becoming a popular choice in Das Haus playlists. While it can only fire two shots before reloading it, you can use the Akimbo attachment to double the firepower. It doesn’t matter whether you do this in the chaos of Das Haus, so although its not the most popular Shotgun, the Double Barrel gets some love.\n9. Einhorn Changing / Gracey Auto 3.4%. Even the most used shotguns are getting a bit of love in the Das Haus Shotgun meta. These include Einhorn Revolving and Gracey Auto, with the same kill share.\nThe two semi-automatic shots will cause little damage to enemies in close range, so you can use these high killstreaks to fight enemies. If the Combat Shotgun gets a nerf, there’s a good chance one of these guns will take its place. Check out the cheapest Gracey auto loader for CoD Vanguard.\n8. ITRA Burst 3,5 %. Since weapons can destroy opponents, the ITRA Burst is the worst used assault rifle in the game. It fires four shots instead of three, so it is rare for it to escape. It will kill you after all four of those bursts. Even if only a few bullets connect, the time of the ITRA will drop dramatically, and you’re probably dying before you have another burst of water. You should try the best loadout to make it more strong.\n7. MG42 4,5 %. The classic MG42 made it into the top ten – and now it is even more popular than most Shotguns.\nThe MG42 is a powerful pick, with a fast fire rate, a big magazine size and a low recoil rate. And since this was very mobile, you could be moved around the map, without heavy vehicles leaving you feeling overwhelmed. If you haven’t yet developed LMGs, you can’t go wrong with the MG42.\n6. NZ-41 4,5 % And the NZ-41 is a powerful, versatile and powerful use of Assault Rifle in Duty: Preventive. As a weapon of all sorts, it can be used for any purpose. The only thing that gets in a lot of popularity is the STG44, which works the same job but is unlocked first and probably does better. With the weeks coming, it will be hard to see the NZ-41 overtake other ARs, such as the AS44.\n5. FAR / AS44 5.0% Combined with BAR, AS44 and BAR become the fifth most popular weapons, all of which have a kill share. The BAR isn’t the best tool for close-range battles, but if you manage to get up and hold down a position, there will be no stopping you. Each bullet does massive damage, so it only takes a couple of shots to win.\nAs far as the AS44 is, it’s very strong in close-range, and its high recoil and blooming mechanic give it a fail for longer. The AS44 can be used well when pushing to enemies but if you don’t want to use it on larger maps like Oasis, you don’t want the same as the Volk further down on the list.\n4. Volkssturmgewehr 5,2 %, e.g. The Volkssturmgewehr features a brilliant fire rate, making it even very effective for close-range fights. If enemies are not on the map with the Volk, but if you yell with an Assault frog, that is an excellent choice. It’s likely not as popular as missing SMGs from the list, but it deserves to be third most popular of all of its popularity. We stock the best Volk loads to maximize our possible potential.\n3. Automaton 10:2:50. With the quick response and extremely fast response from the players into the game, it was quickly acknowledged as an extremely powerful choice.\nThe Automaton can be built to keep close to the point or be very accurate at the point of motion. It’s not surprising that its the second most popular Assault Rifle in the country.\n2. Combat shotguns 14,1%. With the advanced V2 rockets achieved, the Combat Shotgun got the most out of the house. With this heavy pistol loadout, you could win at the enemy spawn without even thinking about it. You can easily get killfeed after killfeed. While overpowered shotguns are the most popular weapon in Vanguard, players are both chasing those incredible nuke clips and ranking up Shotguns. Should you choose the best fight gun loadout, make sure that you’re running at Das Haus the best.\n1. STG44 23,2 % It isn’t surprising that the STG44 is the most popular weapon in the United States, used by almost half the players. You get the first Assault and can kill with the enemy’s bullet.\nWhile it might be the better weapon in the game, this classic WW2 assault Rifle is extremely easy to use. Players with all skill levels can benefit from it. If the bugged two-shot attachments are nerfed, the STG44 will likely drop the pecking order. But for now its a very solid choice in Vanguards multiplayer, so make sure you use the best STG44 loadout. And those are the top 10 most popular weapons of Vanguard, not counting SMGs (yet). If youre interested in SMGs, you can check out Vanguards best SMG loadouts.
