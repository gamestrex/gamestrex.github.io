On this page:\nGenshin Impact Yoimiya Talents, skills, star, element, and weapon Yoimiya is a 5-Star Pyro archer who is best used in a main DPS (damage per second) role when fighting single targets due to her low Elemental Energy costs and high normal attack damage.\nYoimiya Talents, skills, star, element, and weapon Yoimiya Talent materials Yoimiya Ascension materials Yoimiya Constellation\nYoimiya build:\nHow to play Yoimiya in Genshin Impact Best Yoimiya team comp Best Yoimiya Artifacts Best Yoimiya weapon Best Yoimiya build\nHere’s a summary of Yoimiya’s abilities and stats in Genshin Impact:\nElement: Pyro Rarity: 5-Star Weapon: Bow Banner: Tapestry of Golden Flames Best build: Main DPS Normal Attack: Firework Flare-Up Elemental Skill: Niwabi Fire-Dance Elemental Burst: Ryuukin Saxifrage Passive one: Tricks of the Trouble Maker (During Niwabi Fire-Dance, shots from Yoimiya’s normal attack will increase her Pyro damage bonus by 2% on hit - this lasts three seconds and can have a maximum of ten stacks) Passive two: Summer Night’s Dawn (Using Ryuukin Saxifrage causes nearby party members to gain a 10% attack increase for 15 seconds, and an additional 1% attack bonus will occur with every stack of Tricks of the Trouble Maker Yoimiya has when Ryuukin Saxifrge is activated) Crafting bonus: Blazing Match (when Yoimiya crafts Decoration, Ornament, and Landscape Furnishings, she has a 100% chance to refund a portion of the materials used)\nYoimiya Normal Attack: Firework Flare-Up Yoimiya can perform a five hit combo with her bow, with the third and fifth hit causing the most damage. If her normal attack is charged instead, it will convert into Pyro damage after one charge. If the charge reaches Level 2, it will generate Kindling Arrows, with a maximum of three Kindling Arrows. Although her normal attack is most effective against single targets, Yoimiya’s plunging attack fires off a shower of arrows that deals AOE (area of effect) damage upon impact.\nYoimiya Elemental Skill: Niwabi Fire-Dance When activated, Yoimiya’s Elemental Skill changes her normal attack into Blazing Arrows, converting it into Pryo damage while increasing the damage dealt. However, while Niwabi Fire-Dance is activated, Firework Flare-Up won’t create Kindling Arrows at its second charge level.\nYoimiya Elemental Burst: Ryuukin Saxifrage Yoimiya leaps into the air and throws blazing fireworks to the ground, dealing AOE Pyro damage, and marking one random opponent with the Aurous Blaze effect. When marked by Aurous Blaze, an enemy hit with an attack of any kind by a party member other than Yoimiya will trigger an explosion that deals AOE pyro damage. If an opponent dies before Aurous Blaze deactivates, it will be transferred to a nearby enemy. Only one Aurous Blaze can be triggered every two seconds, and will deactivate immediately if Yoimiya is downed.\nGenshin Impact Yoimiya Talent materials To get the most out of using Yoimiya, you will have to level her skills up by using Talent materials, which vary from character-to-character.\rFor Yoimiya, you’re going to need to farm a lot of Transience and Scroll items (if you don’t already have them) to fully upgrade her capabilities. As Yoimiya has three Talents, you will have to spend three times the Talent materials listed below to fully upgrade all of her abilities.\rHere’s what Yoimiya Talent materials and Mora you need to improve one of her abilities:\rHere’s what Talent Materials you’ll need to fully upgrade one of Yoimiya’s skills:\nx1 Crown of Insight x3 Teachings of Transience x6 Divining Scroll x6 Dragon Lord’s Crown x21 Guide to Transience x22 Sealed Scroll x31 Forbidden Curse Scroll x38 Philosophies to Transience 1,652,500 Mora\nTo upgrade all three of Yoimiya’s skills, here’s all the Talent Materials you’ll need:\nx3 Crown of Insight x9 Teachings of Transience x18 Divining Scroll x18 Dragon Lord’s Crown x63 Guide to Transience x66 Sealed Scroll x93 Forbidden Curse Scroll x114 Philosophies to Transience 4,957,500 Mora\nGenshin Impact Yoimiya Ascension materials Just like Talents, you need to use Yoimiya Ascension materials to upgrade her health, attack, defence, and critical hit effectiveness.\rFor Yoimiya, you’re going to need to farm a lot of Naku Weed and Smoldering Pearl materials (if you don’t already have them) to fully upgrade her capabilities. Unlike Talent materials, you only need to spend the below Ascension materials once to fully raise Yoimiya to her highest character level. There is also Acquaint Fate rewarded for reaching certain Ascension levels. You can spend this Fate on the standard and beginner Banners to Wish for characters and weapons.\rHere’s what Yoimiya Ascension materials and Mora you need to upgrade her for each Ascension level:\rIn total, here’s all the Ascension Materials you need for Yoimiya in Genshin Impact:\nx1 Agnidus Agate Silver x6 Agnidus Agate Gemstone x9 Agnidus Agate Fragment x9 Agnidus Agate Chunk x18 Divining Scroll x30 Sealed Scroll x36 Forbidden Curse Scroll x46 Smoldering Pearl x168 Naku Weed 420,000 Mora\nGenshin Impact Yoimiya Constellation By getting duplicates of Yoimiya from wishing on Banners, you will receive her Stella Fortuna. This material allows you to unlock Constellation levels, with each upgrade either improving an existing Talent or Passive ability.\rWhile Yoimiya is actually perfectly fine at Constellation 0 (C0), there are some nice perks she can get from her Constellations. Here are all of Yoimiya’s Constellation level upgrades in Genshin Impact:\nAgate Ryuukin (C1): Aurous Blaze lasts for an extra four seconds, and when an opponent affected by Aurous Blaze is defeated, Yoimiya’s attack is increased by 20% for 20 seconds. A Procession of Bonfires (C2): When Yoimiya gets a critical hit with Pyro damage, she gains a 25% increase in Pyro damage dealt for six seconds - this can be triggered even when Yoimiya is not on the field. Trickster’s Flare (C3): Upgrades Yoimiya’s Elemental Skill, Niwabi Fire-Dance, by 3 levels, with a maximum upgrade level of 15. Pyrotechnic Professional (C4): When Aurous Blaze triggers an explosion, Niwabi Fire-Dance’s cooldown is decreased by 1.2 seconds. A Summer Festival’s Eve (C5): Increases Yoimiya’s Elemental Burst, Ryuukin Saxifrage, by three levels, with a maximum upgrade level of 15. Naganohara Meteor Swarm (C6): When Niwabi Fire-Dance is activated, Yoimiya’s normal attacks have a 50% chance of firing an extra Blazing Arrow, dealing 60% of its original damage - however, this is normal attack damage, not elemental.\nHow to play Yoimiya in Genshin Impact It’s all about normal attacks with Yoimiya in Genshin Impact - not charged or plunging, just her ordinary five-hit combo. Due to this, her entire build and team comp will mostly be focused on raising the damage of her normal attacks. To make Yoimiya’s normal attacks even more effective, you should be trying to activate her Elemental Skill, Niwabi Fire-Dance, as much as possible. This converts her attacks into Pyro damage, with a scaling damage bonus depending on her normal attack Talent Level. This means upgrading her normal attack should be Yoimiya Talent priority. Due to her focus on normal attacks, Yoimiya is best used when fighting single targets, like a boss. If you’re in need of some more AOE damage, you can activate her Elemental Burst, Ryuukin Saxifrage, which will also increase other party members’ damage. Including Kazuha or Xiangling in your party comp can also provide AOE damage support on top of Yoimya’s single target-focused playstyle. Other effective team comps will apply Overload or Vaporize Elemental Reactions to maximise Yoimiya’s DPS potential, while ideally providing the party with some AOE damage as well.\nBest Yoimiya team comp in Genshin Impact There are a lot of options when it comes to building a team around Yoimiya’s DPS capabilities. Ideally, you’ll want her to be your main DPS carry, with elemental reactions from either Hydro or Electro support characters. One of the best team comps is two Hydro supports to garuantee Vaporize as often as possible - with Yelan and Xingqiu being the two most effective. The same can be used for an Overload elemental reaction with Fishcl and Beidou. You can even combine the elemental reactions and run one Hydro and Electro character with Yoimiya. For the last slot in either of these teams, you might want to run Zhongli for his shields, or Jean for her healing capabilities. Bennett can also provide more Pyro damage and Energy Particles if needed. To capitalize on as much Pyro damage as possible, a team of Kazuha and Bennett is recommended to run alongside Yoimiya. Venti can also work in place of Kazuha. Once again, you can run a shielded character on the fourth slot (ideally Zhongli) to ensure Yoimiya doesn’t get interupted during her normal attack combo - or Jean if you’re in need of a healer. For even more Pyro damage, try including Xiangling instead.\nBest Yoimiya Artifacts in Genshin Impact The best Yoimiya Artifacts in Genshin Impact for a DPS build will either increase her base attack, normal attack, Pyro damage, or critical hit effectiveness. Whether this be through general percentage increases, or by increasing damage from an elemental reaction. With this in mind, there are actually a few different Artifact sets you can equip on Yoimiya for a good DPS build. First up, there’s the four-piece Crimson Witch, which should be equipped if you’re running a Vaporize, Overload, or Melt team. Even if you equip a two-piece, you’ll get an increase of 15% Pyro damage. Another effective Artifact set for Yoimiya is the four-piece Shimenawa Reminiscence set, which relies on you activating Yoimiya’s Elemental Skill regularly to increase her normal, charged, and plunging attack damage by 50% for ten seconds. A two-piece will increase her base attack by 18%. Lastly, we have the four-piece Lavawalker set. It increases damage against enemies affected by Pyro by 35%. The two-piece Lavawalker is unfortunately only useful in certain situations, as its only effect increases Yoimiya’s Pyro resistance by 40%.\nBest Yoimiya weapon in Genshin Impact Yoimiya’s best weapon is the 5-Star Thundering Pulse bow. It increases Yoimiya’s critical hit, base attack, and normal attack damage by a large amount, even at Refinement Rank 1. Even better, you don’t have to worry about activating the bow’s increased damage, as you’ll benefit from its perks by using any of Yoimiya’s attacks - but we recommend sticking to normal as much as you can.\rFor other 5-Star weapon options, pretty much any bow will work with Yoimiya, as long as it’s built for DPS. This means look out for high base attack, critical hit, and normal attack modifiers. The Aqua Simulacra will fulfill your crit damage needs (but will need Refined to reach its full potential), while the Skyward Harp can also crit effectively and add a little AOE damage as well. If you don’t want to Wish on weapon Banners for the Thundering Pulse or other 5-Star bows, then there are a few alternative weapons that will still work well with Yoimiya. The 4-Star Hamayumi is a craftable bow that will increase Yoimiya’s normal and charge attacks, but we recommend using the 4-Star Rust bow if you have it. Rust adds damage to each normal attack and will increase Yoimiya’s base attack as well, with a slight sacrifice to her charged attack capabilities. As you should be using her normal attack and Elemental Skill as your primary damage dealers, this won’t really effect Yoimiya’s DPS capabilities. To really get the most out of Rust, you’ll want to Refine it as much as you can. Genshin Impact version 3.3 is here, with new codes, and new character Scaramouche (Wanderer), so find out where he’s placed on our tier list. You’ll need Primogems and luck of the Pity and 50/50 systems to Wish with Fate for him and other current and next banners. You’ll also need the right Adventure Rank for events. For more Sumeru help, we’ve got pages on Sumeru Reputation, Tree of Dreams, Dendroculus locations, the Aeonblight Drake boss, the Garden of Endless Pillars Domain, and locations for Nilotpala Lotus, Padisarah, Scarabs, and Redcrest.\rYou can also now unlock the Genius Invokation TCG and, if you want help building your deck, check out our Genius Invokation TCG Card List.\rIf you want to relax, however, why not try fishing at one of the many fishing spot locations?\nBest Yoimiya build in Genshin Impact With all this in mind, if you want to take advantage of Yoimiya’s DPS capabilities, we have compiled what we think is currently the best Yoimiya build in Genshin Impact:\nYoimiya Best Weapon: Thundering Pulse (or Rust as a 4-Star option). Yoimiya Best Artifacts: Four-piece Crimson Witch, Shimenawa Reminiscence, or Lavawalker sets. Yoimiya Best team comp: A team built around Vaporize (Yelan, Xingqiu) or Overload (Fischl, Beidou), with the fourth slot best filled in by a support like Zhongli or Jean.\nIt can take a lot of time to find these Artifacts and materials to level-up Yoimiya to her full potential, but with an easy playstyle and flexible team comps, she’s worth it if you don’t want to invest time and materials into higher tiered characters with a tougher build to get right. Good luck levelling up Yoimiya in Genshin Impact!\n","wordCount":"2275","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-28T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-28T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Viola Natonabah"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/genshin-impact-yoimiya-best-build-and-talent-ascension-materials-constellation-team-weapon/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Genshin Impact Yoimiya Best Build And Talent Ascension Materials Constellation Team Weapon</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-28 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 28, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2275 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Viola Natonabah</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#genshin-impact-yoimiya-talents-skills-star-element-and-weapon>Genshin Impact Yoimiya Talents, skills, star, element, and weapon</a><ul><li><a href=#yoimiya-normal-attack-firework-flare-up>Yoimiya Normal Attack: Firework Flare-Up</a></li><li><a href=#yoimiya-elemental-skill-niwabi-fire-dance>Yoimiya Elemental Skill: Niwabi Fire-Dance</a></li><li><a href=#yoimiya-elemental-burst-ryuukin-saxifrage>Yoimiya Elemental Burst: Ryuukin Saxifrage</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#genshin-impact-yoimiya-talent-materials>Genshin Impact Yoimiya Talent materials</a></li><li><a href=#genshin-impact-yoimiya-ascension-materials>Genshin Impact Yoimiya Ascension materials</a></li><li><a href=#genshin-impact-yoimiya-constellation>Genshin Impact Yoimiya Constellation</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-play-yoimiya-in-genshin-impact>How to play Yoimiya in Genshin Impact</a></li><li><a href=#best-yoimiya-team-comp-in-genshin-impact>Best Yoimiya team comp in Genshin Impact</a></li><li><a href=#best-yoimiya-artifacts-in-genshin-impact>Best Yoimiya Artifacts in Genshin Impact</a></li><li><a href=#best-yoimiya-weapon-in-genshin-impact>Best Yoimiya weapon in Genshin Impact</a></li><li><a href=#best-yoimiya-build-in-genshin-impact>Best Yoimiya build in Genshin Impact</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>The firework-loving archer is featured in her returning Tapestry of Golden Flames event Banner alongside boosted 4-Stars Bennett, Xinyan, and Yun Jin.

For Yoimiya, you&rsquo;re going to need to farm a lot of Transience and Scroll items (if you don&rsquo;t already have them) to fully upgrade her capabilities.
As Yoimiya has three Talents, you will have to spend three times the Talent materials listed below to fully upgrade all of her abilities.
Here&rsquo;s what Yoimiya Talent materials and Mora you need to improve one of her abilities:
Here&rsquo;s what Talent Materials you&rsquo;ll need to fully upgrade one of Yoimiya&rsquo;s skills:</p><p>x1 Crown of Insight x3 Teachings of Transience x6 Divining Scroll x6 Dragon Lord&rsquo;s Crown x21 Guide to Transience x22 Sealed Scroll x31 Forbidden Curse Scroll x38 Philosophies to Transience 1,652,500 Mora</p><p>To upgrade all three of Yoimiya&rsquo;s skills, here&rsquo;s all the Talent Materials you&rsquo;ll need:</p><p>x3 Crown of Insight x9 Teachings of Transience x18 Divining Scroll x18 Dragon Lord&rsquo;s Crown x63 Guide to Transience x66 Sealed Scroll x93 Forbidden Curse Scroll x114 Philosophies to Transience 4,957,500 Mora</p><h2 id=genshin-impact-yoimiya-ascension-materials>Genshin Impact Yoimiya Ascension materials<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-yoimiya-ascension-materials>#</a></h2><p>Just like Talents, you need to use Yoimiya Ascension materials to upgrade her health, attack, defence, and critical hit effectiveness.
For Yoimiya, you&rsquo;re going to need to farm a lot of Naku Weed and Smoldering Pearl materials (if you don&rsquo;t already have them) to fully upgrade her capabilities.
Unlike Talent materials, you only need to spend the below Ascension materials once to fully raise Yoimiya to her highest character level. There is also Acquaint Fate rewarded for reaching certain Ascension levels. You can spend this Fate on the standard and beginner Banners to Wish for characters and weapons.
Here&rsquo;s what Yoimiya Ascension materials and Mora you need to upgrade her for each Ascension level:
In total, here&rsquo;s all the Ascension Materials you need for Yoimiya in Genshin Impact:</p><p>x1 Agnidus Agate Silver x6 Agnidus Agate Gemstone x9 Agnidus Agate Fragment x9 Agnidus Agate Chunk x18 Divining Scroll x30 Sealed Scroll x36 Forbidden Curse Scroll x46 Smoldering Pearl x168 Naku Weed 420,000 Mora</p><h2 id=genshin-impact-yoimiya-constellation>Genshin Impact Yoimiya Constellation<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-yoimiya-constellation>#</a></h2><p>By getting duplicates of Yoimiya from wishing on Banners, you will receive her Stella Fortuna. This material allows you to unlock Constellation levels, with each upgrade either improving an existing Talent or Passive ability.
While Yoimiya is actually perfectly fine at Constellation 0 (C0), there are some nice perks she can get from her Constellations.
Here are all of Yoimiya&rsquo;s Constellation level upgrades in Genshin Impact:</p><p>Agate Ryuukin (C1): Aurous Blaze lasts for an extra four seconds, and when an opponent affected by Aurous Blaze is defeated, Yoimiya&rsquo;s attack is increased by 20% for 20 seconds. A Procession of Bonfires (C2): When Yoimiya gets a critical hit with Pyro damage, she gains a 25% increase in Pyro damage dealt for six seconds - this can be triggered even when Yoimiya is not on the field. Trickster&rsquo;s Flare (C3): Upgrades Yoimiya&rsquo;s Elemental Skill, Niwabi Fire-Dance, by 3 levels, with a maximum upgrade level of 15. Pyrotechnic Professional (C4): When Aurous Blaze triggers an explosion, Niwabi Fire-Dance&rsquo;s cooldown is decreased by 1.2 seconds. A Summer Festival&rsquo;s Eve (C5): Increases Yoimiya&rsquo;s Elemental Burst, Ryuukin Saxifrage, by three levels, with a maximum upgrade level of 15. Naganohara Meteor Swarm (C6): When Niwabi Fire-Dance is activated, Yoimiya&rsquo;s normal attacks have a 50% chance of firing an extra Blazing Arrow, dealing 60% of its original damage - however, this is normal attack damage, not elemental.</p><h2 id=how-to-play-yoimiya-in-genshin-impact>How to play Yoimiya in Genshin Impact<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-play-yoimiya-in-genshin-impact>#</a></h2><p>It&rsquo;s all about normal attacks with Yoimiya in Genshin Impact - not charged or plunging, just her ordinary five-hit combo. Due to this, her entire build and team comp will mostly be focused on raising the damage of her normal attacks.
To make Yoimiya&rsquo;s normal attacks even more effective, you should be trying to activate her Elemental Skill, Niwabi Fire-Dance, as much as possible. This converts her attacks into Pyro damage, with a scaling damage bonus depending on her normal attack Talent Level. This means upgrading her normal attack should be Yoimiya Talent priority.
Due to her focus on normal attacks, Yoimiya is best used when fighting single targets, like a boss. If you&rsquo;re in need of some more AOE damage, you can activate her Elemental Burst, Ryuukin Saxifrage, which will also increase other party members&rsquo; damage. Including Kazuha or Xiangling in your party comp can also provide AOE damage support on top of Yoimya&rsquo;s single target-focused playstyle.
Other effective team comps will apply Overload or Vaporize Elemental Reactions to maximise Yoimiya&rsquo;s DPS potential, while ideally providing the party with some AOE damage as well.</p><h2 id=best-yoimiya-team-comp-in-genshin-impact>Best Yoimiya team comp in Genshin Impact<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-yoimiya-team-comp-in-genshin-impact>#</a></h2><p>There are a lot of options when it comes to building a team around Yoimiya&rsquo;s DPS capabilities. Ideally, you&rsquo;ll want her to be your main DPS carry, with elemental reactions from either Hydro or Electro support characters.
One of the best team comps is two Hydro supports to garuantee Vaporize as often as possible - with Yelan and Xingqiu being the two most effective. The same can be used for an Overload elemental reaction with Fishcl and Beidou. You can even combine the elemental reactions and run one Hydro and Electro character with Yoimiya.
For the last slot in either of these teams, you might want to run Zhongli for his shields, or Jean for her healing capabilities. Bennett can also provide more Pyro damage and Energy Particles if needed.
To capitalize on as much Pyro damage as possible, a team of Kazuha and Bennett is recommended to run alongside Yoimiya. Venti can also work in place of Kazuha. Once again, you can run a shielded character on the fourth slot (ideally Zhongli) to ensure Yoimiya doesn&rsquo;t get interupted during her normal attack combo - or Jean if you&rsquo;re in need of a healer. For even more Pyro damage, try including Xiangling instead.</p><h2 id=best-yoimiya-artifacts-in-genshin-impact>Best Yoimiya Artifacts in Genshin Impact<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-yoimiya-artifacts-in-genshin-impact>#</a></h2><p>The best Yoimiya Artifacts in Genshin Impact for a DPS build will either increase her base attack, normal attack, Pyro damage, or critical hit effectiveness. Whether this be through general percentage increases, or by increasing damage from an elemental reaction.
With this in mind, there are actually a few different Artifact sets you can equip on Yoimiya for a good DPS build. First up, there&rsquo;s the four-piece Crimson Witch, which should be equipped if you&rsquo;re running a Vaporize, Overload, or Melt team. Even if you equip a two-piece, you&rsquo;ll get an increase of 15% Pyro damage.
Another effective Artifact set for Yoimiya is the four-piece Shimenawa Reminiscence set, which relies on you activating Yoimiya&rsquo;s Elemental Skill regularly to increase her normal, charged, and plunging attack damage by 50% for ten seconds. A two-piece will increase her base attack by 18%.
Lastly, we have the four-piece Lavawalker set. It increases damage against enemies affected by Pyro by 35%. The two-piece Lavawalker is unfortunately only useful in certain situations, as its only effect increases Yoimiya&rsquo;s Pyro resistance by 40%.</p><h2 id=best-yoimiya-weapon-in-genshin-impact>Best Yoimiya weapon in Genshin Impact<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-yoimiya-weapon-in-genshin-impact>#</a></h2><p>Yoimiya&rsquo;s best weapon is the 5-Star Thundering Pulse bow. It increases Yoimiya&rsquo;s critical hit, base attack, and normal attack damage by a large amount, even at Refinement Rank 1. Even better, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about activating the bow&rsquo;s increased damage, as you&rsquo;ll benefit from its perks by using any of Yoimiya&rsquo;s attacks - but we recommend sticking to normal as much as you can.
For other 5-Star weapon options, pretty much any bow will work with Yoimiya, as long as it&rsquo;s built for DPS. This means look out for high base attack, critical hit, and normal attack modifiers. The Aqua Simulacra will fulfill your crit damage needs (but will need Refined to reach its full potential), while the Skyward Harp can also crit effectively and add a little AOE damage as well.
If you don&rsquo;t want to Wish on weapon Banners for the Thundering Pulse or other 5-Star bows, then there are a few alternative weapons that will still work well with Yoimiya. The 4-Star Hamayumi is a craftable bow that will increase Yoimiya&rsquo;s normal and charge attacks, but we recommend using the 4-Star Rust bow if you have it.
Rust adds damage to each normal attack and will increase Yoimiya&rsquo;s base attack as well, with a slight sacrifice to her charged attack capabilities. As you should be using her normal attack and Elemental Skill as your primary damage dealers, this won&rsquo;t really effect Yoimiya&rsquo;s DPS capabilities. To really get the most out of Rust, you&rsquo;ll want to Refine it as much as you can.
Genshin Impact version 3.3 is here, with new codes, and new character Scaramouche (Wanderer), so find out where he&rsquo;s placed on our tier list.
You&rsquo;ll need Primogems and luck of the Pity and 50/50 systems to Wish with Fate for him and other current and next banners. You&rsquo;ll also need the right Adventure Rank for events. For more Sumeru help, we&rsquo;ve got pages on Sumeru Reputation, Tree of Dreams, Dendroculus locations, the Aeonblight Drake boss, the Garden of Endless Pillars Domain, and locations for Nilotpala Lotus, Padisarah, Scarabs, and Redcrest.
You can also now unlock the Genius Invokation TCG and, if you want help building your deck, check out our Genius Invokation TCG Card List.
If you want to relax, however, why not try fishing at one of the many fishing spot locations?</p><h2 id=best-yoimiya-build-in-genshin-impact>Best Yoimiya build in Genshin Impact<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-yoimiya-build-in-genshin-impact>#</a></h2><p>With all this in mind, if you want to take advantage of Yoimiya&rsquo;s DPS capabilities, we have compiled what we think is currently the best Yoimiya build in Genshin Impact:</p><p>Yoimiya Best Weapon: Thundering Pulse (or Rust as a 4-Star option). Yoimiya Best Artifacts: Four-piece Crimson Witch, Shimenawa Reminiscence, or Lavawalker sets. Yoimiya Best team comp: A team built around Vaporize (Yelan, Xingqiu) or Overload (Fischl, Beidou), with the fourth slot best filled in by a support like Zhongli or Jean.</p><p>It can take a lot of time to find these Artifacts and materials to level-up Yoimiya to her full potential, but with an easy playstyle and flexible team comps, she&rsquo;s worth it if you don&rsquo;t want to invest time and materials into higher tiered characters with a tougher build to get right.
Good luck levelling up Yoimiya in Genshin Impact!</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Yoimiya-Genshin-Impact.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Yoimiya-Genshin-Impact.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact Yoimiya best build and Talent  Ascension materials  Constellation  team  weapon -
