This game’s a lot closer than you might expect, and while spice is the key to controlling the universe, the information is a few seconds long. Here’s everything we know about Dune: Spice Wars. Contents\nRelease date Platforms Trailer Gameplay Multiplayer DLC Pre-order.\nSee more The fiction masterpiece is made up of substance and spectacle. The best superhero games of all time. The best games of all time.\nRelease date Dune: Spice Wars has the ambitious turnaround time between the announcement of the recent news announcement at the end of 2021 and a window of 2022. There’s more to it than just a little blurry. The developers announced that PC players will be able to play the game in early access, so they can give feedback on ensuring accessibility while keeping true to the originals of Frank Herbert’s work and making a unique game where the very interesting features of the Dune universe are translated into a compelling gaming experience. That is okay, but later, they look at the amount of time it takes to get to this point. Since we estimate that we’re running for 9-12 months, it will vary depending on the size of time we can reach the milestones and implement all our planned features and content. But there is no rush. With those quotes, the release date is based on the version in which the game gets access early and not the full product. If the first time that the first time that the first time the next time the second half of the week’s visit will continue for 9 to 12 months then 2023 would become the precise window for Dune’s Spice Wars!\nPlatforms There’s no official list of platforms that are known as Dune: Spice Wars expected, however, we can at least say for sure that it will come to PC via steam, since there’s already a store page up for it for preparation of the early access launch. This is just an RTS style game that didn’t ensure the PC was all but assured. As far as other platforms, prediction is almost impossible. I doubt that some RTS games, especially recent, have grown better into consoles than they’ve been in the past. Perhaps, if Dune is so complex, it would be a PC-only game. Once they reach early access or the team officially announces platforms, we’ll have a better idea what to expect.\nTrailer The official announcement trailer for Dune: Spice Wars is only one click. There’s not much to see, but we can dig up plenty of material out of the sand. The trailer opens on the desert city of Arrakis under siege. The book reflects a series of voices that quote some key lines of the novel and come into the discussion about power and war. The voices eventually fumbled until nothing different could be heard. The camera continued to pull from the city and show a massive desert and a sandworm before revealing the entire scene was held by the giant hand. The final words that we hear clearly are. This is a great achievement that the hand closes the scene and crushes it in the mouth of a billow of sand, and the voices in the end are pleading. Besides that, the story is completely secret. We don’t know how closely the books will follow, but the only thing not mentioned from the official website is that players will create their own story and play as a faction of various factions, such as House Atreides and House Harkonnen, and compete for power of Dune and the spice. The team at Shiro Games at least claims that they love the Dune property, and want to do it justice, stating: I think I speak for all who aspire to the community when I say I’m all massive fans of Dune – a remake of the original novel and the original, but also the new and spectacular Denis Villeneuve film. It’s incredible to be able to become a strategic game for this universe. It sounds pretty strange at least, but it seems like it will need to wait until the game is approaching.\nGameplay Before we do, we know what to expect from Dune: Spice Wars because it’s billed as an RTS. Where things get a bit more interesting is that it’s also claimed that it is also used to have 4X elements. For those unawares, 4X stands for explore, expand, exploit, exterminate, and is typically associated with the Civilization franchise where that is the main means of victory. There is no official gameplay record yet, but the team commented on how things will work in the Dune setting. The Dune universe is the perfect place for a strategy game. You have major factions, such as House Atreides and House Harkonnen, with a rivalry that spans centuries. You have political intrigue, deception, and warfare, all centered around what is actually the most valuable substance of the universe: Spice. Finally there’s a stage, Arrakis, a hostile planet and a variety of hidden wonders to explore. Massive sandworms devour all of the armies, sandstorms, spice harvesters that our amazing team of developers have integrated into this game. The scope of the game is much larger than a traditional RTS, where you have to overproduce and overwhelm your opponent. These are other, more subtle, nonviolent options that are available. Another quote from the games official description confirms these plans. Human resources could be used to sabotage, kill and spy, or by utilizing political means to influence the Landsraad and pass beneficial resolutions; can build the world’s wealth and simply overwhelm the other houses; or you can choose open war. Along with these two men, House Atreides and House Harkonnen, it’s possible that Fremon and Imperial Sardaukar will fill one or more additional slots to balance the game. The mention of the sandworms was a little further expanded, and could be very dangerous as well as unresolved if you don’t scan for them before passing through the desert. When the game’s first day comes, the team will surely change, and adapting to it’s major way. Player feedback will guide the team as it adds more features and content, brings balance changes and also adds new modes of game.\nMultiplayer This is another component that isn’t officially confirmed, but in all other ways is expected. RTS games and even 4X games are good used by other people. If it follows the normal RTS structure that Dune: Spice Wars looks poised to do, there will likely be some kind of campaign for each of the main factions, and then a full-on multiplayer mode where you will pit these factions against each other. Speaking of their comments about early access implementations of new game modes, one can understand that they will have huge consequences. I’ll tell you once more, this is technically all done. If multiplayer is in the plan, then he will not arrive when you go to a rapid service, as it is in the case of the Halo Infinite launch, but we must wait and see.\nDLC This is another really tough call. If the game is complete. Now that the game begins at the same time, it seems like it’s only a team with much patience to add new features and content. But who knows who would like that to be until the game goes to full release. Multiplayer-centered DLC, assuming that playing multiplayer is part of the package, makes all the sense. New factions resemble RTS-style games and can help prolong the life of the community.\nOrder before or after delivery. You still have to preorder Dune: Spice Wars, although you can add the game to your Steam wishlist for the early access period. That is still an ambiguous time in 2022 and it’s going to be more time after that before fully pre-orders even go live. Rolling from early access to full release, at least on PC, may even mean there won’t be any pre-orders since the early access version will technically fill this role. This is another info we’ll have to keep in mind in the coming months.\n","wordCount":"1406","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-19T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-19T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Marvin Madsen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/what-do-we-know-about-dune-spices-/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>What Do We Know About Dune Spices</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-19 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 19, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1406 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Marvin Madsen</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li></li></ul></li><li><a href=#release-date>Release date</a></li><li><a href=#platforms>Platforms</a></li><li><a href=#trailer>Trailer</a></li><li><a href=#gameplay>Gameplay</a></li><li><a href=#multiplayer>Multiplayer</a></li><li><a href=#dlc>DLC</a></li><li><a href=#order-before-or-after-delivery>Order before or after delivery.</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>While all genres originate from a warp, it isn’t easy to argue that a book of fiction was actually created.
