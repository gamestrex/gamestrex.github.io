Below you’ll discover how many endings there are in both versions of The Stanley Parable, along with how to reach all of the endings. Just be warned - this guide does contain spoilers! On this page: Most are found by going through either the left of right door and deciding whether you’re going to deviate from The Narrator’s instructions. There are few, however, which occur before you even reach the two doors. To truly understand The Stanley Parable, we recommend experiencing as many endings as possible, especially since the Ultra Deluxe edition has introduced new ones. There are 19 endings to find in The Stanley Parable, with Ultra Deluxe including an additional 24 endings. Though it’s important to note that one of the original Stanley Parable endings is not present in Ultra Deluxe. This means that the total number of endings in The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe is 42. Below you’ll find instructions on how to experience every ending in both The Stanley Parable and Ultra Deluxe. To make this guide easy to navigate, we’ve divided the sections into left door endings, right door endings, pre-door endings and the new endings added with Ultra Deluxe. We’ve also tried to keep the instructions vague to avoid spoilers, but you’re still reading this at your own risk! While we’ve kept the instructions below simple, you are wandering into spoiler territory.\nBroom Closet Ending Follow The Narrator’s instructions you reach the Broom Closet and, instead of continuing forward, head into the Broom Closet. Make sure you close the door, so you can truly enjoy the closet. Continue hanging out in the Broom Closet until The Narrator asks for a new player. At this point, step out of the closet and listen to The Narrator. When he finishes speaking, head back into the Broom Closet until he finishes speaking. You can now continue with the game as normal, restart the story or stay in the Broom Closet forever more. If you return to the Broom Closet in another play through The Narrator will certainly have a reaction.\nCountdown Ending Follow The Narrator’s instructions, but chose to turn the machine on.\nFreedom Ending Follow The Narrator’s instructions.\nHeaven Ending To reach this endings, you need to complete the following steps: The game will then automatically restart and you’ll be sent to heaven. When you’re ready to leave, restart the story.\nMariella Ending When you reach the staircase, go down instead of up and then explore the new area you find yourself in.\nEscape Pod Ending Reach the boss’ office and, just as you’ve entered the room, exit back into the hallway. If you’ve done this at the right time, the doors for the office will close and you’ll be left in the hallway. Next, backtrack to the first room and you’ll discover that the door next to Stanley’s office is now open. Go through this door and climb the stairs until you reach the ending.\nMuseum Ending If this is your first time playing The Stanley Parable, we recommend completing a number of endings as the museum does contain spoilers. To reach the museum, follow The Narrator’s instructions until you see a sign labelled ‘Escape’ and, when you do, head in the direction it indicates. Upon reaching the museum, explore it at your leisure and, when you’re ready to leave, find the hallway with the exit sign hanging above it. Beyond this sign, you’ll find an On / Off switch for the Stanley Parable itself, which you need to interact with to complete this ending.\nApartment Ending Take the elevator in the warehouse to the upper floor and follow the corridor until you reach a door. Next, go through the door and pick up the phone.\nArt Ending For this ending, you need to travel on the elevator in the warehouse until it’s going over the catwalk. At this point, drop down the catwalk and walk forward to reach two coloured doors. You now need to go through the blue door three times. At this point, The Narrator will return you to the original door room, but, this time, there will be a third door. Next, follow The Narrator’s instructions until you reach the baby game. This is where the Art Ending becomes complicated. To obtain this ending, you need to play the baby game for four hours and, at the two hour mark, The Narrator will add in a second button you need to press. If you fail the baby game at any point, you’ll receive the Games Ending instead.\nCold Feet Ending Walk onto the elevator in the warehouse and, just as it starts moving, walk back onto the platform behind you. After doing this, jump from the platform onto the ground below.\nConfusion Ending After leaving the employee lounge, take the door on the left and go down the elevator.\nGames Ending It’s important to note that this ending plays out slightly differently depending on whether you’re playing the original Stanley Parable or Ultra Deluxe. In both games, you reach this ending by jumping down onto the catwalk in the warehouse while travelling on the elevator. Next, you have to go through the blue door three times and, afterwards, follow The Narrator’s instructions until you reach the baby game, which you have to fail. It’s at this point that the ending will deviate depending on which version you’re playing: Stanley Parable Follow The Narrator’s instructions and, when prompted, place the box on the button. Once the elevator rises, jump down the hole and then off the ledge in the new location you find yourself in. Now wander through the corridors until you find room 437 and, shortly after leaving it, this ending will conclude. It’s possible to break the puzzle by putting the box through the door. Ultra Deluxe Explore the new areas you visit and, when The Narrator leaves, drop down one of the holes found in the goals. You then need to go off the ledge in the next area you reach and, afterwards, wander through the corridors till you find a room labelled 437. The ending will end shortly after you’ve left this room.\nNot Stanley Ending Take the elevator in the warehouse to the upper level and follow the corridor along until you reach the phone room. Next, crouch down by the plug socket and interact with it to unplug the phone. You now need to return to the doors room and, once they open, head through the right door. Finding your way blocked, backtrack and go through the left door. After the game resets, go through the right door again. The Narrator will reset the game once more and, this time, you need to head through the left door and visit the boss’ office.\nPowerful Ending In the warehouse, walk off the elevator to the floor below.\nZending Ending Get on the elevator in the warehouse and wait until it’s passing over the catwalk. When this happens, drop down to the catwalk. If you miss, you’ll receive the Cold Feet ending. Once you’re on the catwalk, keep moving forward until you reach the two coloured doors. From here, follow The Narrator’s instructions and he’ll take you to the starry dome. When you’ve reached the starry dome, exit again by the door and travel down the corridor to reach a staircase. You now need to jump off the staircase until the game resets.\nCoward Ending Close the door for Stanley’s office and wait.\nOut of the Window Ending Walk onto the chair for desk 434 to climb onto the desk itself. Crouch down once you’re on the desk and walk out of the window. The Narrator will ask you a question during this ending and, depending on your answer, it will conclude in a different way.\nSerious Ending It’s important to note that the Serious Ending is not available in The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe. If you want to experience this ending in the original game, you first need to open the properties for The Stanley Parable by right-clicking on it in your Steam Library and add ‘-console’ to the Launch Options. Next, start the game and you’ll find that a console has appeared on the main menu. Now you need to type ‘sv_cheats 1’ into the console and submit it. You can do this an additional two times for slightly different dialogue from The Narrator.\nWhiteboard Ending Sometimes, when the story resets, you’ll discover that the office adjoining Stanley’s has been transformed into a blue room. When this occurs, you can open door 426 and discover the Whiteboard ending. On the whiteboard, you’ll find the code for or the option to switch on ‘Bark,’ which causes a barking sound to occur whenever you press the Interact button. Once you’ve finished looking at the whiteboard, you can continue playing the game as normal. To reach the new content, you need to play through a number of the original Stanley Parable endings. After doing so, a door labelled ‘New Content’ will appear in the corridor before the room containing those classic two doors.\nThe Memory Zone Ending To begin the path for this ending, you need to go through the door labelled ‘New Content’ and feel satisfied with the enjoyment the said new content gives you. Once you’ve reached peak enjoyment, the game will reset. Next, you need to follow The Narrator into the vent. If, however, you go up the stairs, you’ll be returned to the offices and can play out another ending. By going through the vent, you’ll reach The Memory Zone and you need to explore it until your way is blocked by boxes. At this point, you need to go into the previous room where the door to Memory Zone Maintenance - which is down the stairs - will be open. Now continue forward until you reach the Skip Button room. Keep pressing the Skip Button, listening to as much or as little dialogue as you like, until you’re able to leave the room. Do so and walk until the game resets.\nThe Stanley Parable 2 Ending To reach this ending, you must first complete The Memory Zone ending. After doing so, you’ll find that The Narrator has placed a neon sign next to the ‘New Content’ door. Head through the door and explore the new offices, until you reach the expo hall. Here there are a number of features you can enjoy, but, to progress, you must visit the Reassurance Bucket and Collectibles. Still, The Narrator has put a lot of effort into these features, so it’s worth visiting them all. When you’re ready, go up the stairs located to the left of the Collectibles exhibit. Once The Narrator is finished, the game will reset.\nBottom of the Mind Control Facility Ending If you played the original Stanley Parable, you may remember the bug which allowed you to reach the bottom of the Mind Control Facility. Well, in Ultra Deluxe, this bug is definitely worth revisiting. To reach this ending, you need to climb atop the first desk in the mind control facility and drop down over the railing. You can turn the lights on first, but it won’t affect the ending. This ending is available before you unlock the new content.\nElevator Ending To get this ending you need to first take the elevator down to the Mind Control Facility. Instead of heading forward, however, you need to press the up button in the elevator and return to the boss’ office. Keep repeating this until The Narrator takes you to a new location and, with it, a new ending. You can obtain this ending before unlocking the new content.\nVent Ending For this ending, you need to visit the warehouse where, near a pile of boxes, you’ll find a plank you can climb onto. Doing so will allow you to drop down to a plank pathway below. After doing so, turn to your immediate left and head through the vent to reach a new section of the office.\nReassurance Bucket Endings Carrying the Reassurance will change a significant number of the ending in The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe. The only expectations are the Broom Closet, which works in a similar fashion to the original version just with a bucket, the Whiteboard ending - where the Reassurance Bucket will be available but won’t change anything - and the What is a Bucket? ending, which is a new ending rather than a reworked version. Here are the ending which are altered by the Reassurance Buckets presence and, to avoid spoilers, we’ve listed them by the names used in the sections above:\nApartment Bottom of the Mind Control Facility Broom Closet Like the original Broom Closet ending, allows you to continue with the game after you’ve listened to the dialogue. Cold Feet Confusion Countdown Elevator You will need to press three to progress this ending. Escape Pod Completing this ending will remove the bucket from the office for at least one playthrough. Don’t worry, you’ll get a replacement. Freedom Mariella Museum Walk out and touch the bucket at the highest point of the museum. New Content Take the bucket through the door labelled ‘New Content.’ Not Stanley Out of the Window Powerful Vent What is a Bucket? Head to the warehouse and drop down to the catwalk while travelling on the elevator. Next head through the open door and follow The Narrator’s instructions until you reach the What is a Bucket? room. The answers you give won’t change the ending.\nUnless stated otherwise, you reach the Reassurance Bucket endings by following the steps outlined in the previous sections. You can also get a small easter egg if you take the bucket to the Reassurance Bucket exhibit in the Expo Hall, which is accessed by taking the bucket through the ‘New Content’ door.\nCollectibles Ending To obtain this ending, you need to find all six of the Stanley collectibles The Narrator has hidden throughout the office. Here is where you can find the Stanley figurines:\nAs part of The Stanley Parable 2 ending In the Executive Bathroom At the bottom of the stairs which lead to the boss’s office\nBefore the lift leading to the Mind Control Facility In a small room to the right of the red and blue door In the warehouse - reach by using the plank resting against a pile of boxes to drop down to a plank pathway\nAfter collecting your second collectible, the meeting room will be transformed and include a list of the Stanley figurines locations. This list will also tick off each figurine you find, helping you keep track of which ones you’re looking for. Once you’ve found all six, finish whichever ending you’re currently doing and, when the game resets, the Collectibles ending will begin. To finish it, follow The Narrator’s instructions.\nEpilogue To unlock the Epilogue, you need to fully restart Ultra Deluxe itself until you’re no longer receiving dialogue from the mysterious person who really likes sliders and experience the Collectibles Ending. Once both of these requirements have been met, the Epilogue will appear as an option in the main menu. To avoid spoilers, all we’ll say about the Epilogue is that progression is straightforward and that you can replay it as many times as you like. Hope you enjoy The Stanley Parable!\n","wordCount":"2587","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-12T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-12T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Antonio Ritchie"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/stanley-parable-all-endings-and-how-many-endings-there-are-explained/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Stanley Parable All Endings And How Many Endings There Are Explained</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-12 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 12, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2587 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Antonio Ritchie</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#broom-closet-ending>Broom Closet Ending</a></li><li><a href=#countdown-ending>Countdown Ending</a></li><li><a href=#freedom-ending>Freedom Ending</a></li><li><a href=#heaven-ending>Heaven Ending</a></li><li><a href=#mariella-ending>Mariella Ending</a></li><li><a href=#escape-pod-ending>Escape Pod Ending</a></li><li><a href=#museum-ending>Museum Ending</a></li><li><a href=#apartment-ending>Apartment Ending</a></li><li><a href=#art-ending>Art Ending</a></li><li><a href=#cold-feet-ending>Cold Feet Ending</a></li><li><a href=#confusion-ending>Confusion Ending</a></li><li><a href=#games-ending>Games Ending</a></li><li><a href=#not-stanley-ending>Not Stanley Ending</a></li><li><a href=#powerful-ending>Powerful Ending</a></li><li><a href=#zending-ending>Zending Ending</a></li><li><a href=#coward-ending>Coward Ending</a></li><li><a href=#out-of-the-window-ending>Out of the Window Ending</a></li><li><a href=#serious-ending>Serious Ending</a></li><li><a href=#whiteboard-ending>Whiteboard Ending</a></li><li><a href=#the-memory-zone-ending>The Memory Zone Ending</a></li><li><a href=#the-stanley-parable-2-ending>The Stanley Parable 2 Ending</a></li><li><a href=#bottom-of-the-mind-control-facility-ending>Bottom of the Mind Control Facility Ending</a></li><li><a href=#elevator-ending>Elevator Ending</a></li><li><a href=#vent-ending>Vent Ending</a></li><li><a href=#reassurance-bucket-endings>Reassurance Bucket Endings</a></li><li><a href=#collectibles-ending>Collectibles Ending</a></li><li><a href=#epilogue>Epilogue</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe not only allows you to experience those classic adventures with Stanley and The Narrator, but contains a host of new endings for you to find.
Below you’ll discover how many endings there are in both versions of The Stanley Parable, along with how to reach all of the endings. Just be warned - this guide does contain spoilers!
On this page:
Most are found by going through either the left of right door and deciding whether you&rsquo;re going to deviate from The Narrator&rsquo;s instructions. There are few, however, which occur before you even reach the two doors.
To truly understand The Stanley Parable, we recommend experiencing as many endings as possible, especially since the Ultra Deluxe edition has introduced new ones.
There are 19 endings to find in The Stanley Parable, with Ultra Deluxe including an additional 24 endings.
Though it&rsquo;s important to note that one of the original Stanley Parable endings is not present in Ultra Deluxe. This means that the total number of endings in The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe is 42.
Below you’ll find instructions on how to experience every ending in both The Stanley Parable and Ultra Deluxe. To make this guide easy to navigate, we’ve divided the sections into left door endings, right door endings, pre-door endings and the new endings added with Ultra Deluxe.
We’ve also tried to keep the instructions vague to avoid spoilers, but you’re still reading this at your own risk!
While we’ve kept the instructions below simple, you are wandering into spoiler territory.</p><h3 id=broom-closet-ending>Broom Closet Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#broom-closet-ending>#</a></h3><p>Follow The Narrator’s instructions you reach the Broom Closet and, instead of continuing forward, head into the Broom Closet.

When he finishes speaking, head back into the Broom Closet until he finishes speaking. You can now continue with the game as normal, restart the story or stay in the Broom Closet forever more.
If you return to the Broom Closet in another play through The Narrator will certainly have a reaction.</p><h3 id=countdown-ending>Countdown Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#countdown-ending>#</a></h3><p>Follow The Narrator’s instructions, but chose to turn the machine on.</p><h3 id=freedom-ending>Freedom Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#freedom-ending>#</a></h3><p>Follow The Narrator’s instructions.</p><h3 id=heaven-ending>Heaven Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#heaven-ending>#</a></h3><p>To reach this endings, you need to complete the following steps:

Go through this door and climb the stairs until you reach the ending.</p><h3 id=museum-ending>Museum Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#museum-ending>#</a></h3><p>If this is your first time playing The Stanley Parable, we recommend completing a number of endings as the museum does contain spoilers.

You now need to go through the blue door three times. At this point, The Narrator will return you to the original door room, but, this time, there will be a third door.
Next, follow The Narrator’s instructions until you reach the baby game. This is where the Art Ending becomes complicated.
To obtain this ending, you need to play the baby game for four hours and, at the two hour mark, The Narrator will add in a second button you need to press. If you fail the baby game at any point, you’ll receive the Games Ending instead.</p><h3 id=cold-feet-ending>Cold Feet Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cold-feet-ending>#</a></h3><p>Walk onto the elevator in the warehouse and, just as it starts moving, walk back onto the platform behind you. After doing this, jump from the platform onto the ground below.</p><h3 id=confusion-ending>Confusion Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#confusion-ending>#</a></h3><p>After leaving the employee lounge, take the door on the left and go down the elevator.</p><h3 id=games-ending>Games Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#games-ending>#</a></h3><p>It’s important to note that this ending plays out slightly differently depending on whether you’re playing the original Stanley Parable or Ultra Deluxe.
In both games, you reach this ending by jumping down onto the catwalk in the warehouse while travelling on the elevator. Next, you have to go through the blue door three times and, afterwards, follow The Narrator’s instructions until you reach the baby game, which you have to fail.
It’s at this point that the ending will deviate depending on which version you’re playing:
Stanley Parable
Follow The Narrator’s instructions and, when prompted, place the box on the button. Once the elevator rises, jump down the hole and then off the ledge in the new location you find yourself in.
Now wander through the corridors until you find room 437 and, shortly after leaving it, this ending will conclude.
It’s possible to break the puzzle by putting the box through the door.
Ultra Deluxe
Explore the new areas you visit and, when The Narrator leaves, drop down one of the holes found in the goals.
You then need to go off the ledge in the next area you reach and, afterwards, wander through the corridors till you find a room labelled 437. The ending will end shortly after you’ve left this room.</p><h3 id=not-stanley-ending>Not Stanley Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#not-stanley-ending>#</a></h3><p>Take the elevator in the warehouse to the upper level and follow the corridor along until you reach the phone room.
Next, crouch down by the plug socket and interact with it to unplug the phone.
You now need to return to the doors room and, once they open, head through the right door. Finding your way blocked, backtrack and go through the left door.
After the game resets, go through the right door again.
The Narrator will reset the game once more and, this time, you need to head through the left door and visit the boss’ office.</p><h3 id=powerful-ending>Powerful Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#powerful-ending>#</a></h3><p>In the warehouse, walk off the elevator to the floor below.</p><h3 id=zending-ending>Zending Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#zending-ending>#</a></h3><p>Get on the elevator in the warehouse and wait until it’s passing over the catwalk. When this happens, drop down to the catwalk. If you miss, you’ll receive the Cold Feet ending.
Once you’re on the catwalk, keep moving forward until you reach the two coloured doors. From here, follow The Narrator’s instructions and he’ll take you to the starry dome.
When you’ve reached the starry dome, exit again by the door and travel down the corridor to reach a staircase. You now need to jump off the staircase until the game resets.</p><h3 id=coward-ending>Coward Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#coward-ending>#</a></h3><p>Close the door for Stanley’s office and wait.</p><h3 id=out-of-the-window-ending>Out of the Window Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#out-of-the-window-ending>#</a></h3><p>Walk onto the chair for desk 434 to climb onto the desk itself. Crouch down once you’re on the desk and walk out of the window.
The Narrator will ask you a question during this ending and, depending on your answer, it will conclude in a different way.</p><h3 id=serious-ending>Serious Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#serious-ending>#</a></h3><p>It&rsquo;s important to note that the Serious Ending is not available in The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe.
If you want to experience this ending in the original game, you first need to open the properties for The Stanley Parable by right-clicking on it in your Steam Library and add ‘-console’ to the Launch Options.
Next, start the game and you’ll find that a console has appeared on the main menu. Now you need to type ‘sv_cheats 1’ into the console and submit it.
You can do this an additional two times for slightly different dialogue from The Narrator.</p><h3 id=whiteboard-ending>Whiteboard Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#whiteboard-ending>#</a></h3><p>Sometimes, when the story resets, you’ll discover that the office adjoining Stanley’s has been transformed into a blue room.
When this occurs, you can open door 426 and discover the Whiteboard ending. On the whiteboard, you’ll find the code for or the option to switch on ‘Bark,’ which causes a barking sound to occur whenever you press the Interact button.
Once you’ve finished looking at the whiteboard, you can continue playing the game as normal.
To reach the new content, you need to play through a number of the original Stanley Parable endings. After doing so, a door labelled ‘New Content’ will appear in the corridor before the room containing those classic two doors.</p><h3 id=the-memory-zone-ending>The Memory Zone Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-memory-zone-ending>#</a></h3><p>To begin the path for this ending, you need to go through the door labelled ‘New Content’ and feel satisfied with the enjoyment the said new content gives you. Once you’ve reached peak enjoyment, the game will reset.
Next, you need to follow The Narrator into the vent. If, however, you go up the stairs, you’ll be returned to the offices and can play out another ending.
By going through the vent, you’ll reach The Memory Zone and you need to explore it until your way is blocked by boxes.
At this point, you need to go into the previous room where the door to Memory Zone Maintenance - which is down the stairs - will be open. Now continue forward until you reach the Skip Button room.
Keep pressing the Skip Button, listening to as much or as little dialogue as you like, until you’re able to leave the room. Do so and walk until the game resets.</p><h3 id=the-stanley-parable-2-ending>The Stanley Parable 2 Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-stanley-parable-2-ending>#</a></h3><p>To reach this ending, you must first complete The Memory Zone ending.
After doing so, you’ll find that The Narrator has placed a neon sign next to the ‘New Content’ door. Head through the door and explore the new offices, until you reach the expo hall.
Here there are a number of features you can enjoy, but, to progress, you must visit the Reassurance Bucket and Collectibles. Still, The Narrator has put a lot of effort into these features, so it’s worth visiting them all.
When you’re ready, go up the stairs located to the left of the Collectibles exhibit. Once The Narrator is finished, the game will reset.</p><h3 id=bottom-of-the-mind-control-facility-ending>Bottom of the Mind Control Facility Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#bottom-of-the-mind-control-facility-ending>#</a></h3><p>If you played the original Stanley Parable, you may remember the bug which allowed you to reach the bottom of the Mind Control Facility. Well, in Ultra Deluxe, this bug is definitely worth revisiting.
To reach this ending, you need to climb atop the first desk in the mind control facility and drop down over the railing. You can turn the lights on first, but it won’t affect the ending.
This ending is available before you unlock the new content.</p><h3 id=elevator-ending>Elevator Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#elevator-ending>#</a></h3><p>To get this ending you need to first take the elevator down to the Mind Control Facility. Instead of heading forward, however, you need to press the up button in the elevator and return to the boss’ office.
Keep repeating this until The Narrator takes you to a new location and, with it, a new ending.
You can obtain this ending before unlocking the new content.</p><h3 id=vent-ending>Vent Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#vent-ending>#</a></h3><p>For this ending, you need to visit the warehouse where, near a pile of boxes, you’ll find a plank you can climb onto. Doing so will allow you to drop down to a plank pathway below.
After doing so, turn to your immediate left and head through the vent to reach a new section of the office.</p><h3 id=reassurance-bucket-endings>Reassurance Bucket Endings<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#reassurance-bucket-endings>#</a></h3><p>Carrying the Reassurance will change a significant number of the ending in The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe.
The only expectations are the Broom Closet, which works in a similar fashion to the original version just with a bucket, the Whiteboard ending - where the Reassurance Bucket will be available but won’t change anything - and the What is a Bucket? ending, which is a new ending rather than a reworked version.
Here are the ending which are altered by the Reassurance Buckets presence and, to avoid spoilers, we’ve listed them by the names used in the sections above:</p><p>Apartment Bottom of the Mind Control Facility Broom Closet Like the original Broom Closet ending, allows you to continue with the game after you’ve listened to the dialogue. Cold Feet Confusion Countdown Elevator You will need to press three to progress this ending. Escape Pod Completing this ending will remove the bucket from the office for at least one playthrough. Don’t worry, you’ll get a replacement. Freedom Mariella Museum Walk out and touch the bucket at the highest point of the museum. New Content Take the bucket through the door labelled ‘New Content.’ Not Stanley Out of the Window Powerful Vent What is a Bucket? Head to the warehouse and drop down to the catwalk while travelling on the elevator. Next head through the open door and follow The Narrator’s instructions until you reach the What is a Bucket? room. The answers you give won’t change the ending.</p><p>Unless stated otherwise, you reach the Reassurance Bucket endings by following the steps outlined in the previous sections.
You can also get a small easter egg if you take the bucket to the Reassurance Bucket exhibit in the Expo Hall, which is accessed by taking the bucket through the &lsquo;New Content&rsquo; door.</p><h3 id=collectibles-ending>Collectibles Ending<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#collectibles-ending>#</a></h3><p>To obtain this ending, you need to find all six of the Stanley collectibles The Narrator has hidden throughout the office.
Here is where you can find the Stanley figurines:</p><p>As part of The Stanley Parable 2 ending In the Executive Bathroom At the bottom of the stairs which lead to the boss’s office</p><p>Before the lift leading to the Mind Control Facility In a small room to the right of the red and blue door In the warehouse - reach by using the plank resting against a pile of boxes to drop down to a plank pathway</p><p>After collecting your second collectible, the meeting room will be transformed and include a list of the Stanley figurines locations. This list will also tick off each figurine you find, helping you keep track of which ones you’re looking for.
Once you’ve found all six, finish whichever ending you’re currently doing and, when the game resets, the Collectibles ending will begin. To finish it, follow The Narrator’s instructions.</p><h3 id=epilogue>Epilogue<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#epilogue>#</a></h3><p>To unlock the Epilogue, you need to fully restart Ultra Deluxe itself until you&rsquo;re no longer receiving dialogue from the mysterious person who really likes sliders and experience the Collectibles Ending.
Once both of these requirements have been met, the Epilogue will appear as an option in the main menu.
To avoid spoilers, all we’ll say about the Epilogue is that progression is straightforward and that you can replay it as many times as you like.
Hope you enjoy The Stanley Parable!</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/stanley_parable_ending_37.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/stanley_parable_ending_37.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Stanley Parable all endings and how many endings there are explained -
