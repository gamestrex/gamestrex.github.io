I spoke with Patrick Naud, who started the studio. We talked about the changes in games and some of the best work of the studios. Many traditional game companies did not succeed as well as Square Enix Montreal did in mobile games. It’s one of a number of success stories in Montreal. In the video games industry, the median city job growth increased by 8 % annually and 28% in visual effects. In 2021 alone, Montreal International worked with 12 gaming studios to establish or expand in Montreal for the total investment required for the next three years. Since 2016, Montreal International has helped complete nearly 60 gaming and VFX projects (implementation or expansion) in Montreal. That has over 1,99 billion dollars of money. In addition to 2009-2019, the gaming and VFX industry in greater Montreal added averaging 1000 new jobs a year according to KPMG. Square Enix Montreal has 170 employees. Here’s an edited transcript of our interview. Above: Patrick Naud is the boss of Square Enix Montreal. Image Credit: Square Enix. GamesBeat: What’s the main concern for you right now in terms of the topics? Patrick Naud should think short-term. We worked to get our first game-winning version into the global market. It was the biggest focus of our lives. Through this, we celebrated five years of fun. The space is fun now for the Square Enix in Montreal. We celebrated what we’ve done, but also the prospect of the future. GamesBeat: What types of games have already come out here? What were you able to do? A raf: We announced that Hitman Sniper has hit the air. It was a premium game back then due to the success we had with Hitman Sniper, which we released in 2015. And all the learning we learned is one way or the other to become a service game: Taking the knowledge to the play space with The Shadows. And the second title we announced is the AR of Space Invaders. How can we use the awesome AR technology to celebrate this legend’s Space Invaders IP? I can’t talk too much about this now, but it’s a part of our big push for the early next year. GamesBeat: What kind of game is that? What have you spoken about it a lot lately? This is what I had described our games as that the beauty of what we did, and that’s really close to the DNA we acquired, is the making of the games that we wanted to make. We’re making games that we believe will work in the open space. Instead of following the trend of seeing what works today, instead of saying more of it, it would be better to find out how we can bring on new experience on mobile that will become the next big thing, that will become the games which others might be much used to clone. Both of these games are completely different, but they are still two games that, we believe, will impact the mobile world. How well Hitman Sniper has done over the years? Naud: I don’t know precisely what we’ve been communicating, but I’ll put it this way. Using Hitman Sniper as a service game, we started by doing events. We would have Halloween, Christmas, Chinese New Year, Golden Week, and the fourth of July. These were five events, must-see events in the game that we started doing. We started to see an increase in active users. Wed see many churned users coming back, and it was a good opportunity to bring in new users. This is how we learned free-play. It’s how we learned how to correctly operate service games. We learned how to tailor packages to specific players, making sure all players can stay in the game as long as possible by bringing their needs to work. This is why year two for Hitman Sniper was better than the first year; and year three better than the second. That is why we strongly believe that Hitman Sniper: The Shadows will be even more successful, and that, in keeping with the teachings I had by the abyss we had wedded to in the first game. Above: Square Enix Montreals. The image is by Square Enix. GamesBeat: Did this game start with a premium option? This was a good start. All of the first games we conceived were, not just Hitman, but the Go-series games – and still all worth the effort. You have to pay. But obviously, converting Sniper into a live service, we began to do more price promotion and lowered our prices. We are doing a lot more revenue for it after that, and even ad revenue, than we were paying first. The more we cut the price, the more people bought it. We talked about the fact that it was so much more expensive to lower the price that would have benefited users and paid more for the initial sale. GamesBeat: How long did the studio have been doing mobile games now? How did you see any change in mobile technology? Naud started the studio 10 years ago. The next generation console was launched by Hitman. Even though we had basically nine years to go, we switched to mobile. We asked ourselves whether we wanted to take that challenge, and to put our great IP into mobile today. By doing that we learned how to use mobile phones. We built a new mobile experience with all of the DNA that we had from our experiences on consoles. The Go series and Hitman Sniper were the first games we did as a studio. I find it a little tricky to realize that mobile was on the market for 10 years now. There was more room for an experiment new gameplay, to propose something new, or something new. People still asked us to find out how people played on mobile, how we could craft real-life experiences based on mobile. That’s the focus. How do we make mobile as accessible as possible? How do we let our IP millions out of consumers now because they were on mobile? The market has very well matured. You can’t compare up to more different types of experiences, not as long as it gets used. The same three or four art directions, the same three or four gameplay loops, the same three or four metagames. They combine that so that now its super interesting to see that every time you see an ad for a game, you have to get to a remark and think, Did I play this game? It’s why we weren’t focused on trying to produce fresh new games, games that will stand out in crowded places. That’s what worked good at. GamesBeat: How many people does the studio have now? Noun: We were 17-plus full-time workers at the studio. We have many external partners, too. We’re still growing. We have 20 or 25 vacant positions. We need to a few more players to use the best free game that we have in years to come. GameBeat: Square Enix added a mobile studio, too. Oh, that’s my studio. I oversee the mobile application for Square Enix in the west. I am a studio executive. I also manage game and business for Square Enix outside Japan. London studio is the latest studio in our country. It is currently working on Tomb Raider Reloaded. We announced a partnership with Viacom and Avatar, the Last Airbender, as well. GamesBeat: Is that basically an extension of Montreal or is it its own studio? Her studio is a big one. The goal is to focus on internal development in Montreal. We craft and use our own instruments. And then in London we try to find amazing partners across the globe to learn different type of games and different types of games. We can say Montreal and London are internal development and publishing. GamesBeat: What do you see every second of the technological change today as it becomes more and more different than the different trends happening in mobile? We’ve seen in the past few years that there’s room for many more developers on mobile. There are a new generation of mobile-based players. Mobile is their primary device. We see a rise in the numbers of players, but also in the kinds of games the players play. When you look at the success of shooting on mobile in the last few years, esports in the most successful way are now even bigger on mobile. In comparison to those games that have already seen this year like Call of Duty Mobile or Genshin Impact, these massive triple-A console-like experiences can’t stand well on mobiles. Above: Montreal square transformed Hitman. Image Credit: Square Enix. The future of cloud may bring us even more high-end experiences. It’s good for everybody. We’re glad to see that there are more mobile players, and that mobile players are immersed in new expectations. They expect better experiences. GamesBeat: There are several kinds of things that can change now. It means that you can easily promote outside of the App Store now. Is there any chance there? Mood, we haven’t come yet. We were at an early age when we began playing the first game. We were almost ready to ship our first free games for Hitman Sniper and Space Invaders. Yet at this point, Apple and Google are our best partners in bringing our games to the masses. We had trouble figuring out how we could extend monetization further, but we managed to host monetization ourselves. GamesBeat: We saw other changes occurring around NFTs and play-to-earn, new trends that have been adopted by gaming startups, especially in mobile phones. And I like these opportunities. Take a look at what’s going on. And still, we are focused on crafting games that are accessible to players in the world. That isn’t the case for NFTs. There’s a lot of money to make. There are very young people around here. But that is not the focus of our first generation of games. We will continue to play games that are played in the world by everybody. That’s the joy of mobile and the focus of this first generation of games. GamesBeat: It’s interesting to see the company change still. It’s one of the greatest things for me. You know exactly which technology can come along. I discuss that at this time with you. We know that there will be something new in two years. The games were done now, and these are based on where we are now and where the industry is now. And it is exciting to think about that second generation of free-to-play titles. What is the point? How will the market evolve at that time? To date they were focused on Ghost and Space Invaders. They’ve been in the process for a few years now. We were excited to introduce these games to the market and start to use them. Now operate them for years. GamesBeat: How many games do you expect to play simultaneously? Do you plan on moving it? Weve mentioned we have two games in development in London. We’ve announced two exits from Montreal, and there may be another one. But the goal of this first generation is to sell every of these games, to a different audience and a different genre, and to learn these games. Now see what will be the focus of the next generation. Having at least four games in operation also gives us big insight into different audiences and markets. GamesBeat: You’ll never run out of IP, Im sure. We see that IP makes it sometimes more accessible to users. Every day, there’s a lot of content on mobile. IP gives us the advantage of the break. It also helps us craft something that the environment is easy to adapt based on IP. You can have amazing gameplay, but when you use your IP, you can make it even more special. I back to my initial success with Hitman and Lara Croft. Both games basically used the same mechanic, the same type of action. Both men worked because of the treatment of this game, and in terms of respect for the IP and the fans. I can understand how we can do that on a wide range of things related to IP and other types of gaming. GamesBeat: What type of market does you like the most most? I love mobile. It’s global. Just in a look at the number of hits we’re having in 2014, I think 35-40 percent of our sales came from China, Korea and Japan. The USA received 25 percent from the USA and Europe became the only one in all, and that was followed by the rest of the world. This is the joy of mobile phones. It’s the only way that players can play our games. With the increasing mobile market and mobile players, it’s a fun time to play mobile games. They also like to make great trips, but they are often not at all interested in it. You’ll be interested in the release of a game in the mobile space now. You have hundreds of millions of potential users. GamesBeat: How much is it all about building Square Enix? Things like user acquisition, mobile marketing, monetization. Are you using outside vendors? Are you doing that for yourself? We’re doing that ourselves. We’ve built our own backend infrastructure, our own processes. There are a few partners in our tech stack. It is not only our technology. But nothing were at all insufficient. We have our own user-studied team that focuses on mobile players. We have our own marketing team that are building our campaigns, all our messaging and all our assets. We have our own internal user acquisition teams that work to find the best players in the mobile industry. But in the point of gravity, our goal is still to take advantage of the opportunity to develop and compete with such a competitiveness. When we talk about all these games, it’s hard to stand out in a busy mobile market. By making games that look and feel different, we believe that they will perform better on the marketing side.

My challenge is to support the latest technological technology, namely the iPhone 13 and all the power here, but as a result we want to ensure that the people who have the iPhone 8 and have a great experience with our game, too. How do we tailor experiences so that we can up-res them to the most powerful devices, but people with the older ones will still have an enjoyable experience? That’s always a tense drawback. How much can we push while still making sure we make a game accessible to millions of users as much as possible? How do you get in peace with the free-to-play monetization? It depends on what you define in the game. Are they gamers playing League of Legends or Hearthstone or PUBG on mobile or Fortnite? Watch out for the mobile market today, and see how successful such massive free-to-play games like Arena of Valor or Free Fire or Call of Duty or Genshin Impact are. These games are played by tens of millions, then perhaps hundreds of millions of people. These are console-like core games that can be played on mobile. We know that most mobile players use to play the ball every year. Mobile is more and more people’s primary device. She is still growing, growing every year. I highly encourage everybody to build core games because of the large number of players searching for good core experiences on mobile. GamesBeat: We’re seeing new tech interesting for locations, 3D. Does it seem appealing to people to have things like vertical location in games? It’s not something new, as I said, but the emphasis was on crafting high-results. It isn’t technology that was interested in the emergence of our current generation of games. Maybe, later, but not so soon. GamesBeat: Are you already working or working remotely? Naud: We were still working remotely. Our office is open, so we always have people a day at work. Anyone who wants to go to the office can go to the office. We started doing our company, collaboration day, where we bring the full team to the office, but it isn’t compulsory. People can work remotely if they want to connect to these meetings remotely. I’m working for a long time. I don’t anticipate that far away from home on Fridays at the office, but I think that far away it’s worth it to me, I’ll not hesitate to get to work. We must find a common ground for our workers only. That’s the most important thing. You can hire people from around the world, can’t you? Yeah, brought people from all over the world. But bringing in local people will be a lot easier. They know the most about us. They know the values of the company, the types of games that we make. We already have people from all around the world, and that’s still going to be a trend going forward. We need to recognize these things with the globalization of our market, as well as with that diversity in our people, so they can represent a broad range of the people. Above: Patrick Naud, of Square Enix Montréal, spoke with GamesBeat in 2018. Thanks for the link above. GameBeat: Is there a different way of working you learned over the last and a half, running games through remote development? We learned to be transparent. I’m very open about that. We struggled due to the size of our squad. We were much more organic, much less organized prior to sending everyone home. We must learn. We don’t have many managers. Now, the management put the heavy duty on managing all these responsibilities. They have to adapt the most. We’re still well in the house. We’ve learned about this. We have changed our chemistry. That wasn’t easy transition. We’ve been creative. We created new experiences. That’s not a recipe that we can adapt every time. It is a new recipe that we need to make. When all of these recipes were made, there were several possibilities for everyone that was involved in the creation and production of a game. By removing all social, informal and organic discussions, we felt that we lacked these creative conversations that made our games better and more rapid. I’m going to have to wait for a while now. We have to organize all these discussions and all this information flows. GamesBeat: There were many successes for companies that made the transition from desktop to mobile. What were the biggest lessons for you? The great thing is, Square Enix is globally aware of the fact that it’s difficult to build mobile free-to-play games to be different from console and free-to-play. That’s why they let us use the mobile tools to structure so we could find fit. We believed that we could’ve done it in the long run. We couldn’t turn the premium game into free-to-play because we had all the learning we needed, but everyone realized it was what we needed to do. We couldn’t push that. We could get great at our first game. I don’t think that we could’ve been prepared and done anything else two years ago. We aren’t there yet. That’s why we were on the verge of going live with our first games now. That’s what I had to be doing. We needed time. Square Enix was a great partner in this. GamesBeat: What is Montreal like now that a lot of people are getting out of there? Naud: Okay, it is cold. It’s a question. People want to miss Montreal. However, no, the airport is a great hub. We attract people, but with all new studios coming from Montreal, there’s such a competitive place now. With the large amount of talent we have, this will result in big competition. Many studios are open. I have seen someone a new shop once in a month the past 12 months. We were fortunate because it showcases our talent here, but it is still a challenge. Competition for people becomes difficult. The reason we decided to develop an awesome workplace is because we’re having a hard time crafting. Our employees are evangelists. That’s the best way for us to introduce new developers with our evangelists bringing new people that they know will fit within our culture. It’s been quite successful. We’re still looking for lots of new people, but this is a long time to achieve the right goals. GamesBeat: Do you feel like most of the people aboard were mobile or do they more console and hardcore game veterans? He used to be a man of the first generation. What can they craft in mobile? How could they take all the learning they had from the high-end console and bring that to mobile? How can we create this new experience? There were many core console developers that believe in mobile, want to explore what it is to craft these games with a smaller team, where you can see more than anything about what the game will be – then other mobile native developers that have done it before. They combine knowledge and capabilities to operate live titles. As far as the past 10 years have gone, it was an incredible experience. Learning after learning. I wonder where we’re living today. I’m eager to look back, reflect on where we were, and think about how these years went really fast. The next 10 days will be extraordinary. It will likely be as intense as the past 10 months.\n","wordCount":"3698","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-24T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-24T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Willie Schilk"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/square-enix-montreal-celebrates-a-decade-of-triple-a-mobile-games/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Square Enix Montreal Celebrates A Decade Of Triple A Mobile Games</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 24, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;18 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3698 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Willie Schilk</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>The studio opened its doors in 2011 after mobile games began on Android and iOS.

GamesBeat: What types of games have already come out here? What were you able to do?
A raf: We announced that Hitman Sniper has hit the air. It was a premium game back then due to the success we had with Hitman Sniper, which we released in 2015. And all the learning we learned is one way or the other to become a service game: Taking the knowledge to the play space with The Shadows. And the second title we announced is the AR of Space Invaders. How can we use the awesome AR technology to celebrate this legend’s Space Invaders IP? I can’t talk too much about this now, but it’s a part of our big push for the early next year.
GamesBeat: What kind of game is that? What have you spoken about it a lot lately?
This is what I had described our games as that the beauty of what we did, and that’s really close to the DNA we acquired, is the making of the games that we wanted to make. We’re making games that we believe will work in the open space. Instead of following the trend of seeing what works today, instead of saying more of it, it would be better to find out how we can bring on new experience on mobile that will become the next big thing, that will become the games which others might be much used to clone. Both of these games are completely different, but they are still two games that, we believe, will impact the mobile world.
How well Hitman Sniper has done over the years?
Naud: I don’t know precisely what we’ve been communicating, but I’ll put it this way. Using Hitman Sniper as a service game, we started by doing events. We would have Halloween, Christmas, Chinese New Year, Golden Week, and the fourth of July. These were five events, must-see events in the game that we started doing. We started to see an increase in active users. Wed see many churned users coming back, and it was a good opportunity to bring in new users.
This is how we learned free-play. It’s how we learned how to correctly operate service games. We learned how to tailor packages to specific players, making sure all players can stay in the game as long as possible by bringing their needs to work. This is why year two for Hitman Sniper was better than the first year; and year three better than the second. That is why we strongly believe that Hitman Sniper: The Shadows will be even more successful, and that, in keeping with the teachings I had by the abyss we had wedded to in the first game.

GamesBeat: Did this game start with a premium option?
This was a good start. All of the first games we conceived were, not just Hitman, but the Go-series games – and still all worth the effort. You have to pay. But obviously, converting Sniper into a live service, we began to do more price promotion and lowered our prices. We are doing a lot more revenue for it after that, and even ad revenue, than we were paying first. The more we cut the price, the more people bought it. We talked about the fact that it was so much more expensive to lower the price that would have benefited users and paid more for the initial sale.
GamesBeat: How long did the studio have been doing mobile games now? How did you see any change in mobile technology?
Naud started the studio 10 years ago. The next generation console was launched by Hitman. Even though we had basically nine years to go, we switched to mobile. We asked ourselves whether we wanted to take that challenge, and to put our great IP into mobile today. By doing that we learned how to use mobile phones. We built a new mobile experience with all of the DNA that we had from our experiences on consoles. The Go series and Hitman Sniper were the first games we did as a studio.
I find it a little tricky to realize that mobile was on the market for 10 years now. There was more room for an experiment new gameplay, to propose something new, or something new. People still asked us to find out how people played on mobile, how we could craft real-life experiences based on mobile. That’s the focus. How do we make mobile as accessible as possible? How do we let our IP millions out of consumers now because they were on mobile?
The market has very well matured. You can’t compare up to more different types of experiences, not as long as it gets used. The same three or four art directions, the same three or four gameplay loops, the same three or four metagames. They combine that so that now its super interesting to see that every time you see an ad for a game, you have to get to a remark and think, Did I play this game? It’s why we weren’t focused on trying to produce fresh new games, games that will stand out in crowded places. That’s what worked good at.
GamesBeat: How many people does the studio have now?
Noun: We were 17-plus full-time workers at the studio. We have many external partners, too. We’re still growing. We have 20 or 25 vacant positions. We need to a few more players to use the best free game that we have in years to come.
GameBeat: Square Enix added a mobile studio, too.
Oh, that’s my studio. I oversee the mobile application for Square Enix in the west. I am a studio executive. I also manage game and business for Square Enix outside Japan. London studio is the latest studio in our country. It is currently working on Tomb Raider Reloaded. We announced a partnership with Viacom and Avatar, the Last Airbender, as well.
GamesBeat: Is that basically an extension of Montreal or is it its own studio?
Her studio is a big one. The goal is to focus on internal development in Montreal. We craft and use our own instruments. And then in London we try to find amazing partners across the globe to learn different type of games and different types of games. We can say Montreal and London are internal development and publishing.
GamesBeat: What do you see every second of the technological change today as it becomes more and more different than the different trends happening in mobile?
We’ve seen in the past few years that there’s room for many more developers on mobile. There are a new generation of mobile-based players. Mobile is their primary device. We see a rise in the numbers of players, but also in the kinds of games the players play. When you look at the success of shooting on mobile in the last few years, esports in the most successful way are now even bigger on mobile. In comparison to those games that have already seen this year like Call of Duty Mobile or Genshin Impact, these massive triple-A console-like experiences can’t stand well on mobiles.

The future of cloud may bring us even more high-end experiences. It’s good for everybody. We’re glad to see that there are more mobile players, and that mobile players are immersed in new expectations. They expect better experiences.
GamesBeat: There are several kinds of things that can change now. It means that you can easily promote outside of the App Store now. Is there any chance there?
Mood, we haven’t come yet. We were at an early age when we began playing the first game. We were almost ready to ship our first free games for Hitman Sniper and Space Invaders. Yet at this point, Apple and Google are our best partners in bringing our games to the masses. We had trouble figuring out how we could extend monetization further, but we managed to host monetization ourselves.
GamesBeat: We saw other changes occurring around NFTs and play-to-earn, new trends that have been adopted by gaming startups, especially in mobile phones.
And I like these opportunities. Take a look at what’s going on. And still, we are focused on crafting games that are accessible to players in the world. That isn’t the case for NFTs. There’s a lot of money to make. There are very young people around here. But that is not the focus of our first generation of games. We will continue to play games that are played in the world by everybody. That’s the joy of mobile and the focus of this first generation of games.
GamesBeat: It’s interesting to see the company change still. It’s one of the greatest things for me. You know exactly which technology can come along.
I discuss that at this time with you. We know that there will be something new in two years. The games were done now, and these are based on where we are now and where the industry is now. And it is exciting to think about that second generation of free-to-play titles. What is the point? How will the market evolve at that time? To date they were focused on Ghost and Space Invaders. They’ve been in the process for a few years now. We were excited to introduce these games to the market and start to use them. Now operate them for years.
GamesBeat: How many games do you expect to play simultaneously? Do you plan on moving it?
Weve mentioned we have two games in development in London. We’ve announced two exits from Montreal, and there may be another one. But the goal of this first generation is to sell every of these games, to a different audience and a different genre, and to learn these games. Now see what will be the focus of the next generation. Having at least four games in operation also gives us big insight into different audiences and markets.
GamesBeat: You’ll never run out of IP, Im sure.
We see that IP makes it sometimes more accessible to users. Every day, there’s a lot of content on mobile. IP gives us the advantage of the break. It also helps us craft something that the environment is easy to adapt based on IP. You can have amazing gameplay, but when you use your IP, you can make it even more special.
I back to my initial success with Hitman and Lara Croft. Both games basically used the same mechanic, the same type of action. Both men worked because of the treatment of this game, and in terms of respect for the IP and the fans. I can understand how we can do that on a wide range of things related to IP and other types of gaming.
GamesBeat: What type of market does you like the most most?
I love mobile. It’s global. Just in a look at the number of hits we’re having in 2014, I think 35-40 percent of our sales came from China, Korea and Japan. The USA received 25 percent from the USA and Europe became the only one in all, and that was followed by the rest of the world. This is the joy of mobile phones. It’s the only way that players can play our games. With the increasing mobile market and mobile players, it’s a fun time to play mobile games. They also like to make great trips, but they are often not at all interested in it. You’ll be interested in the release of a game in the mobile space now. You have hundreds of millions of potential users.
GamesBeat: How much is it all about building Square Enix? Things like user acquisition, mobile marketing, monetization. Are you using outside vendors? Are you doing that for yourself?
We’re doing that ourselves. We’ve built our own backend infrastructure, our own processes. There are a few partners in our tech stack. It is not only our technology. But nothing were at all insufficient. We have our own user-studied team that focuses on mobile players. We have our own marketing team that are building our campaigns, all our messaging and all our assets. We have our own internal user acquisition teams that work to find the best players in the mobile industry.
But in the point of gravity, our goal is still to take advantage of the opportunity to develop and compete with such a competitiveness. When we talk about all these games, it’s hard to stand out in a busy mobile market. By making games that look and feel different, we believe that they will perform better on the marketing side.

GamesBeat: Compared to the latest iPhones, the latest GPUs do you look interested in more than one thing.
My challenge is to support the latest technological technology, namely the iPhone 13 and all the power here, but as a result we want to ensure that the people who have the iPhone 8 and have a great experience with our game, too. How do we tailor experiences so that we can up-res them to the most powerful devices, but people with the older ones will still have an enjoyable experience? That’s always a tense drawback. How much can we push while still making sure we make a game accessible to millions of users as much as possible?
How do you get in peace with the free-to-play monetization?
It depends on what you define in the game. Are they gamers playing League of Legends or Hearthstone or PUBG on mobile or Fortnite? Watch out for the mobile market today, and see how successful such massive free-to-play games like Arena of Valor or Free Fire or Call of Duty or Genshin Impact are. These games are played by tens of millions, then perhaps hundreds of millions of people. These are console-like core games that can be played on mobile. We know that most mobile players use to play the ball every year. Mobile is more and more people’s primary device.
She is still growing, growing every year. I highly encourage everybody to build core games because of the large number of players searching for good core experiences on mobile.
GamesBeat: We’re seeing new tech interesting for locations, 3D. Does it seem appealing to people to have things like vertical location in games?
It’s not something new, as I said, but the emphasis was on crafting high-results. It isn’t technology that was interested in the emergence of our current generation of games. Maybe, later, but not so soon.
GamesBeat: Are you already working or working remotely?
Naud: We were still working remotely. Our office is open, so we always have people a day at work. Anyone who wants to go to the office can go to the office. We started doing our company, collaboration day, where we bring the full team to the office, but it isn’t compulsory. People can work remotely if they want to connect to these meetings remotely. I’m working for a long time. I don’t anticipate that far away from home on Fridays at the office, but I think that far away it’s worth it to me, I’ll not hesitate to get to work. We must find a common ground for our workers only. That’s the most important thing.
You can hire people from around the world, can’t you?
Yeah, brought people from all over the world. But bringing in local people will be a lot easier. They know the most about us. They know the values of the company, the types of games that we make. We already have people from all around the world, and that’s still going to be a trend going forward. We need to recognize these things with the globalization of our market, as well as with that diversity in our people, so they can represent a broad range of the people.

Thanks for the link above.
GameBeat: Is there a different way of working you learned over the last and a half, running games through remote development?
We learned to be transparent. I’m very open about that. We struggled due to the size of our squad. We were much more organic, much less organized prior to sending everyone home. We must learn. We don’t have many managers. Now, the management put the heavy duty on managing all these responsibilities. They have to adapt the most. We’re still well in the house. We’ve learned about this. We have changed our chemistry. That wasn’t easy transition.
We’ve been creative. We created new experiences. That’s not a recipe that we can adapt every time. It is a new recipe that we need to make. When all of these recipes were made, there were several possibilities for everyone that was involved in the creation and production of a game. By removing all social, informal and organic discussions, we felt that we lacked these creative conversations that made our games better and more rapid. I’m going to have to wait for a while now. We have to organize all these discussions and all this information flows.
GamesBeat: There were many successes for companies that made the transition from desktop to mobile. What were the biggest lessons for you?
The great thing is, Square Enix is globally aware of the fact that it’s difficult to build mobile free-to-play games to be different from console and free-to-play. That’s why they let us use the mobile tools to structure so we could find fit. We believed that we could’ve done it in the long run. We couldn’t turn the premium game into free-to-play because we had all the learning we needed, but everyone realized it was what we needed to do.
We couldn’t push that. We could get great at our first game. I don’t think that we could’ve been prepared and done anything else two years ago. We aren’t there yet. That’s why we were on the verge of going live with our first games now. That’s what I had to be doing. We needed time. Square Enix was a great partner in this.
GamesBeat: What is Montreal like now that a lot of people are getting out of there?
Naud: Okay, it is cold. It’s a question. People want to miss Montreal. However, no, the airport is a great hub. We attract people, but with all new studios coming from Montreal, there’s such a competitive place now. With the large amount of talent we have, this will result in big competition. Many studios are open. I have seen someone a new shop once in a month the past 12 months.
We were fortunate because it showcases our talent here, but it is still a challenge. Competition for people becomes difficult. The reason we decided to develop an awesome workplace is because we’re having a hard time crafting. Our employees are evangelists. That’s the best way for us to introduce new developers with our evangelists bringing new people that they know will fit within our culture. It’s been quite successful. We’re still looking for lots of new people, but this is a long time to achieve the right goals.
GamesBeat: Do you feel like most of the people aboard were mobile or do they more console and hardcore game veterans?
He used to be a man of the first generation. What can they craft in mobile? How could they take all the learning they had from the high-end console and bring that to mobile? How can we create this new experience? There were many core console developers that believe in mobile, want to explore what it is to craft these games with a smaller team, where you can see more than anything about what the game will be – then other mobile native developers that have done it before. They combine knowledge and capabilities to operate live titles.
As far as the past 10 years have gone, it was an incredible experience. Learning after learning. I wonder where we’re living today. I’m eager to look back, reflect on where we were, and think about how these years went really fast. The next 10 days will be extraordinary. It will likely be as intense as the past 10 months.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/square-enix-flatly-denies-it-is-up-for-a-sale/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Square Enix Flatly Denies It Is Up For A Sale</span></a>
