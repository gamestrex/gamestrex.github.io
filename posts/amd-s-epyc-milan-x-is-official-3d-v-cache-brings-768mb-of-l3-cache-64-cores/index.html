AMD is bringing this technology to its long-rumored Milan-X memory processors. But now, it’s not shared the detailed specifications of these new chips. As long as the chips are available, it was revealed to be confirmed by its briefings and notes that the chips will come in at least 16, 32 and 64-core variants, hence a leaked list of the product stack. In fact, we’ve even seen them being sold by a b2b retailer. Here are the four main characters, according to the supposedly reliable: The leaked lineup specifications for the “Milan-X” Refresh-up Asus made on Wednesday morning. ProcessorSorrySpire Spiral Mechanics (M3), clericals and power complicationSfysc — cleronics/rix/dix edlms clericals/wytp-Chio (L3+ 3D clericals)Epyc 7773 / 1158 MHz (HD2)3,5 GHz 27 p.a./SpiroS Like the most common CCD models, AMD stacks 6x6mm layer of L3 cache direct over the L3 cache already present in every CCD. Each CCD contains 32MB of L3 cache before the modification. By adding the L3 cache slice vertically-stacked, there are 64 more MB of cache, which brings total to 96 MB per CCD. The Milan-X chips will carry 80-core models, followed by eight CCDs. The total number will add 768MB of L3 cache per chip. AMD confirms its chips support faster stacks of L3, and HardwareLuxx even found server BIOS settings which allow up to four caches per chip with existing AMD EPYC Milan servers. The L3 cache is based on 825% of the global latency, compared to the standard latency impact due to simple additions of capacity with standard on-die techniques. The extra l3 cache slice is a bit dull, so all the control circuitry resides on the current CCD, to assist in reducing latency. Since the cache grows due to the lower L3 cache hit rate, the extra capacity reduces bandwidth pressure on the main memory, thus reducing latency and improving application performance by multiple axes. AMD uses the same Zen 3-cores as normal, while 3D V-Cache was added to the design process when it first came to design. AMD uses the old-fashioned Milan chips to build the system, therefore they’ll drop into the SP3 sockets of EPYC servers (A BIOS update is required). That reduces the time it takes to prepare and deliver the opportunity. AMD reiterated many of the benefits of the solderless hybrid bonding technique enables 3D V-Cache – like a 200-Y interconnect density increase over 2D chiplets, a 15-y-thick density increase and a 3-X energy efficiency gain over micro-buff 3D packaging. AMD says hybrid bonds improve thermals, transistor density and interconnect pitch over other 3D approaches, making them the most versatile flexible active-on-active silicon stacking technologies. A number of partners are working on a certificate. AMD says no software modifications are necessary to boost the cache capacity. Those packages will also need further performance improvement.

AMD says Milan-X will provide up to a 50% uplift in certain’targeted workloads’ which mostly consist of a variety of product development software. This includes computational fluid dynamics, finite element analysis, structural analysis and electronic design automation, with chip design. AMD claimed that the existing AMD EPYC Milan models were capable of performing three workloads, with two EPYC 75F3 beating two Intel Xeon 8362 in three of those workloads. But the benchmarks don’t include Milan-X. AMD avoided a head-to-head comparison to Intel’s chips with its Milan-X, and showed a 66% performance uplift with a 16-core Milan-X in a chip design/Synopsys VCS (easy) processor. We included the test endnotes at the bottom of the article. AMD says Milan-X is gaining traction and a broader selection of workloads, which you can find on the above show. The company also listed several ISVs, already working on certified software packages like Altair, Cadence, Synopsys etc. The certificated solutions will arrive at the launch. AMD hasn’t yet released official specs or pricing, but we’ll update as soon as the information gets available. The chips come to market in 2022.\nImage 1 of three.

The leaked lineup specifications for the “Milan-X” Refresh-up Asus made on Wednesday morning. ProcessorSorrySpire Spiral Mechanics (M3), clericals and power complicationSfysc — cleronics/rix/dix edlms clericals/wytp-Chio (L3+ 3D clericals)Epyc 7773 / 1158 MHz (HD2)3,5 GHz 27 p.a./SpiroS
Like the most common CCD models, AMD stacks 6x6mm layer of L3 cache direct over the L3 cache already present in every CCD. Each CCD contains 32MB of L3 cache before the modification. By adding the L3 cache slice vertically-stacked, there are 64 more MB of cache, which brings total to 96 MB per CCD. The Milan-X chips will carry 80-core models, followed by eight CCDs. The total number will add 768MB of L3 cache per chip. AMD confirms its chips support faster stacks of L3, and HardwareLuxx even found server BIOS settings which allow up to four caches per chip with existing AMD EPYC Milan servers.
The L3 cache is based on 825% of the global latency, compared to the standard latency impact due to simple additions of capacity with standard on-die techniques. The extra l3 cache slice is a bit dull, so all the control circuitry resides on the current CCD, to assist in reducing latency. Since the cache grows due to the lower L3 cache hit rate, the extra capacity reduces bandwidth pressure on the main memory, thus reducing latency and improving application performance by multiple axes.
AMD uses the same Zen 3-cores as normal, while 3D V-Cache was added to the design process when it first came to design. AMD uses the old-fashioned Milan chips to build the system, therefore they’ll drop into the SP3 sockets of EPYC servers (A BIOS update is required). That reduces the time it takes to prepare and deliver the opportunity.
AMD reiterated many of the benefits of the solderless hybrid bonding technique enables 3D V-Cache – like a 200-Y interconnect density increase over 2D chiplets, a 15-y-thick density increase and a 3-X energy efficiency gain over micro-buff 3D packaging. AMD says hybrid bonds improve thermals, transistor density and interconnect pitch over other 3D approaches, making them the most versatile flexible active-on-active silicon stacking technologies.
A number of partners are working on a certificate. AMD says no software modifications are necessary to boost the cache capacity. Those packages will also need further performance improvement.

AMD says Milan-X will provide up to a 50% uplift in certain’targeted workloads’ which mostly consist of a variety of product development software. This includes computational fluid dynamics, finite element analysis, structural analysis and electronic design automation, with chip design.
AMD claimed that the existing AMD EPYC Milan models were capable of performing three workloads, with two EPYC 75F3 beating two Intel Xeon 8362 in three of those workloads. But the benchmarks don’t include Milan-X.
AMD avoided a head-to-head comparison to Intel’s chips with its Milan-X, and showed a 66% performance uplift with a 16-core Milan-X in a chip design/Synopsys VCS (easy) processor. We included the test endnotes at the bottom of the article.
AMD says Milan-X is gaining traction and a broader selection of workloads, which you can find on the above show. The company also listed several ISVs, already working on certified software packages like Altair, Cadence, Synopsys etc. The certificated solutions will arrive at the launch.
AMD hasn’t yet released official specs or pricing, but we’ll update as soon as the information gets available. The chips come to market in 2022.</p><p>Image 1 of three.
