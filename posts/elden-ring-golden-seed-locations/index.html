There are two types of upgrades to get more from these flasks - Golden Seeds to increase flask uses, and Sacred Tears to increase flask potency. It’s the former we’ll focus on with this page, looking at Golden Seed locations - enough to completely upgrade your uses. It’s also worth knowing there is a third Flask type, the Flask of Wondrous Physick, which requires Crystal Tears to customise. On this page: Looking for some direction? Our what to do first in Elden Ring, Elden Ring walkthrough, Site of Grace locations and main bosses in order pages can help. You also have the option to have a Golden Seed as a starting Keepsake so you can begin with an extra flask charge right away. Once you have a Golden Seed, rest at a Site of Grace and select Flasks from the menu and then Add charge to flask. However, as you upgrade your flask, you’ll also need more Golden Seeds. You can upgrade your flask a maximum of 10 times (with a total of 30 Golden Seeds), taking your maximum flask charges to 14. Oddly enough, we discovered there’s a few leftover Golden Seeds even once you’ve reached the maximum. We have divided up the Golden Seed locations based on each area of the Lands Between with a map pinpointing where they are (look for the yellow arrow cursor indicating the player’s location) in Elden Ring. Just a note however that, in order to see the map, you’ll first need to find Map Fragments for each corresponding area. A Golden Seed can actually be found right by where you start in the Stranded Graveyard, although it’s also in a very dangerous dungeon with a poison swamp, a trap on wheels that chases you around and instantly kills you on contact, and a boss we don’t recommend you go up against until you’ve levelled up your build and weapon first. You’ll also need two Swordstone Keys in order to unfog the entrance blocking your path. The boss is an Ulcerated Tree Spirit who’s not only massive but hits hard, spews a molten ether and also unleashes a blast from its body when you’re close to it, though a shield should absorb the worst of the damage. Stay under its attacks, however, and you’ll best it with a Golden Seed as one of your rewards, as well as a very powerful Spirit Ash. For more information on Spirit Ashes, check out our guide. Stormhill Sacred Tear locations This illusory tree is right on the main path as you go through the Stormgate en route to Stormveil Castle, so you can’t miss it. Stormhill Shack Along the main path on Stormhill you’ll see a shack to your right where there’s a Site of Grace and also one of the rare times you can pick up a Golden Seed that’s not from an illusory tree. Weeping Peninsula Sacred Tear locations South of Limgrave from the Castle Morne Rampart Site of Grace and heading southwest, follow the rockface on your right. You’ll eventually reach a point where you can jump up it, though you’ll want to make use of Torrent’s double jump for this. There’s an illusory tree just up here. Fort Haigh You’ll need to head to Fort Haight southeast of the Mistwood Ruins to find half of a medallion during a quest on the critical path. As you approach the fort, you’ll find an illusory tree. Siofra River Well Depths This area is directly below Limgrave which you can reach south of the Third Church of Marika. The river well lift will take you down to Siofra River Well Depths. You’ll be south of that area, but the illusory tree is located north between Worshippers’ Woods and Below the Well Sites of Graces. From Worshippers’ Woods, head north but stay left until you reach a stone path and head over it. Beware that you’ll also be in view of the ancient spirits patrolling the area who wield bows, and they have a very high accuracy even if you’re riding Torrent to get there fast. Stormveil Castle This illusory tree can be found just before you reach the castle’s boss. There’s actually two routes to get to the boss door where you’ll also find a Site of Grace called Secluded Cell. If you came from a different path, head south from that Site of Grace where you’ll encounter a troll. Continue past it and you’ll see the illusory tree at a wall flanked by two normal trees. In the middle of Liurnia’s massive lake, before you reach Raya Lucaria Academy, is a ruined town. From the Academy Gate Town Site of Grace, head northwest into the town and the illusory tree should stand out. Outside Raya Lucaria Academy Once you can access Raya Lucaria Academy, don’t head in just yet. Go past the teleporting seal in the northeast and you can head down another path. You’ll need Torrent to jump over a gap, but at the very end is another illusory tree with a Golden Seed. Raya Lucaria Academy Inside the academy, from the Debate Parlour Site of Grace, head out into the courtyard. Keep to the left but watch out for enemies, including a rather dangerous one with spinning blades and wheels that you’ll likely be too weak against. Continue left and you’ll find an illusory tree there surrounded by a few enemies who are too busy gazing up at something that they shouldn’t notice you. Caria Manor If you’re following Ranni’s questline, you should reach Caria Manor northwest of Liurnia, which can be reached by passing a fake wall north of Kingsrealm Ruins. When you’ve reached the Manor Upper Level Site of Grace, the illusory tree is just in front of the next area, although beware of a few wolves lurking around. The Ravine North of the lake in Liurnia is a ravine that takes you to Ravine-Veiled Village at the far end, and also a path that can take you to Altus Plateau bypassing the Grand Lift of Dectus. But, before you reach that village, you’ll come across another illusory tree, but be careful as it’s also surrounded by a bunch of giant egg-shaped creatures that spew poisonous fumes. As long as you quickly dip and out to grab the Golden Seed, it won’t be much trouble. Sellia Sorcery Town Heading into Sellia Sorcery Town very early can be dangerous (which you’ll pass through if you’re making your way to our recommended early rune farming spot) but if nothing else, you can also pick up a Golden Seed. When you first enter the town just head up the steps on the left and around to find the illusory tree overlooking Caelid’s blood red sky. South Caelid From Southern Aeonia Swamp Bank Site of Grace, this illusory tree is actually on the route that takes you to the our early rune farming spot near Impassable Greatbridge so don’t miss this, even if you might be running away from those big scary dogs and crows! Beastly Sanctum Northeast of Caelid in Greyoll’s Dragonbarrow, you can reach Farum Greatbridge, which is guarded by a fearsome dragon. You don’t have to fight it though and can still reach the Site of Grace located there. Continue further north and you’ll reach the Beastly Sanctum, where another terrifying boss awaits. Fortunately, you’ll come across the next illusory tree before you reach it. North of the Grand Lift of Dectus you’ll reach Lux Ruins and also a Site of Grace for Erdtree-Gazing Hill, with an illusory tree very close by. Altus Plateau Highway At Altus Plateau Highway’s Site of Grace, instead of heading up the main path into the Capital Outskirts, continue north and the next illusory tree can be seen just a little further ahead. Outer Wall Phantom Tree Not only is there a Site of Grace here, this illusory tree actually has two Golden Seeds at its base! Capital Outskirts From the Outer Wall Phantom Tree, head north and you’ll come across another illusory tree that also has two Golden Seeds. Clearly there’s more blessings the closer you are to the Erdtree! Outside of Outer Wall Battleground From the Outer Wall Battleground Site of Grace, head out of the gate to the northwest and you’ll soon come across an illusory tree along the path. This area has archers firing great arrows at you though so you won’t want to dally for long. Altus Plateau’s Minor Erdtree Continuing from northwest of the Capital Outskirts, and closest to the Windmill Village Grace of Site (home to our recommended late game rune farming spot), you can follow a path southwest that takes you to the area’s Minor Erdtree. But before you reach its base, you’ll find an illusory tree nearby with a Golden Seed. Seethewater River If you’ve been approaching west of Altus Plateau you’ll come across Mt. Gelmir. At its base is Seethewater River just west of Wyndham Ruins. Avoid the hot geyser traps down here and you’ll soon see an illusory tree nearby. Mt. Gelmir High up Mt. Gelmir, overlooking Volcano Manor, is another illusory tree. You can reach it from the Road of Iniquity Site of Grace, although before approaching that point you’ll have also passed a pretty tough boss, at the mountain’s peak, though it’s fortunately one you can skip until you feel more confident. Royal Capital mini boss Remember the Ulcerated Tree Spirit you could fight near the start of the game? Well, here’s another one who bursts out of the ground. You can reach it from the Avenue Balcony Site of Grace and follow some stairs north and around that take you to a suspiciously open area. If you walk closer in, the tree spirit will emerge. Defeat it and you’ll get another Golden Seed. Royal Capital This illusory tree is located just south of the West Capital Rampart Site of Grace. It’s also in the view of a large and formidable gargoyle enemy, although the tree itself is surrounded by some smaller weaker blobby enemies who are busy in worship. If you don’t want to face the gargoyle then just run in, grab the Golden Seed then get out. Once you have settled on a starting class and starting Keepsake item, you should first work out how to level up, how to respec and use Ashes of War.\rNeed some direction from there? Our Elden Ring walkthrough and Elden Ring boss order can help with where to go next, but we also recommend hunting down Golden Seeds, Sacred Tears, Crystal Tears, Talismans and some of our best weapon and best armor choices.\rIf you are approaching the end game, we can help with the Volcano Manor quest and Rykard, Haligtree Secret Medallion locations, solving the Ordina, Liturgical Town puzzle, the Millicent quest, Commander Niall, Morgott, Godskin Duo, Maliketh and Malenia.\rAlthough visibility is poor, the Forbidden Lands path to the Grand Lift of Rold is linear so you shouldn’t have any trouble finding the illusory tree that’s on this path just before you reach the grand lift that takes you up to the Mountaintops of the Giants. Ancient Snow Valley Ruins This illusory tree is actually close to the frozen lake, but when you first arrive in this area, you’ll be coming from the Ancient Snow Valley Ruins Site of Grace. There’s a few golems patrolling this area but head northeast from this Site of Grace and then go around to the right and you’ll approach a cliff edge where the illusory tree is also located. Foot of the Forge From this Site of Grace, an illusory tree is just a little further north before you cross over the chains to the boss. You’ll want to be stealthy though as there’s a troll who can spot you and will throw a massive boulder in your direction. The tree is just at the base of one of the frozen giants. That should be the final Golden Seed you need to fully upgrade your flask charges (unless of course you already got a Golden Seed as a starting gift). Ordina That said, there’s still more Golden Seeds to be found, even if you’ve fully upgraded your flask. This one can only be accessed if you’re following Latenna’s questline in order to reach a secret area in the Mountaintops, and is just west of the town where you need to solve a puzzle in order to reach the Haligtree. Good luck upgrading your flasks in Elden Ring!\n","wordCount":"2119","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-23T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-23T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Luke Royster"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/elden-ring-golden-seed-locations/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Elden Ring Golden Seed Locations</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-23 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 23, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;10 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2119 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Luke Royster</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>There are two types of flasks you can use, Flask of Crimson Tears (red) for recovering HP, and Flask of Cerulean Tears (blue) for recovering FP that is used for abilities like weapon skills and summoning ash spirits.
There are two types of upgrades to get more from these flasks - Golden Seeds to increase flask uses, and Sacred Tears to increase flask potency. It&rsquo;s the former we&rsquo;ll focus on with this page, looking at Golden Seed locations - enough to completely upgrade your uses.
It&rsquo;s also worth knowing there is a third Flask type, the Flask of Wondrous Physick, which requires Crystal Tears to customise.

At Altus Plateau Highway&rsquo;s Site of Grace, instead of heading up the main path into the Capital Outskirts, continue north and the next illusory tree can be seen just a little further ahead.
Outer Wall Phantom Tree
Not only is there a Site of Grace here, this illusory tree actually has two Golden Seeds at its base!

Altus Plateau&rsquo;s Minor Erdtree
Continuing from northwest of the Capital Outskirts, and closest to the Windmill Village Grace of Site (home to our recommended late game rune farming spot), you can follow a path southwest that takes you to the area&rsquo;s Minor Erdtree.

If you don&rsquo;t want to face the gargoyle then just run in, grab the Golden Seed then get out.
Once you have settled on a starting class and starting Keepsake item,
you should first work out how to level up, how to respec and use Ashes of War.
Need some direction from there? Our Elden Ring walkthrough and Elden Ring boss order can help with where to go next, but we also recommend hunting down Golden Seeds, Sacred Tears, Crystal Tears, Talismans and some of our best weapon and best armor choices.
If you are approaching the end game, we can help with the Volcano Manor quest and Rykard, Haligtree Secret Medallion locations, solving the Ordina, Liturgical Town puzzle, the Millicent quest, Commander Niall, Morgott, Godskin Duo, Maliketh and Malenia.
Although visibility is poor, the Forbidden Lands path to the Grand Lift of Rold is linear so you shouldn&rsquo;t have any trouble finding the illusory tree that&rsquo;s on this path just before you reach the grand lift that takes you up to the Mountaintops of the Giants.
Ancient Snow Valley Ruins
This illusory tree is actually close to the frozen lake, but when you first arrive in this area, you&rsquo;ll be coming from the Ancient Snow Valley Ruins Site of Grace. There&rsquo;s a few golems patrolling this area but head northeast from this Site of Grace and then go around to the right and you&rsquo;ll approach a cliff edge where the illusory tree is also located.
Foot of the Forge
From this Site of Grace, an illusory tree is just a little further north before you cross over the chains to the boss. You&rsquo;ll want to be stealthy though as there&rsquo;s a troll who can spot you and will throw a massive boulder in your direction. The tree is just at the base of one of the frozen giants. That should be the final Golden Seed you need to fully upgrade your flask charges (unless of course you already got a Golden Seed as a starting gift).
Ordina
That said, there&rsquo;s still more Golden Seeds to be found, even if you&rsquo;ve fully upgraded your flask. This one can only be accessed if you&rsquo;re following Latenna&rsquo;s questline in order to reach a secret area in the Mountaintops, and is just west of the town where you need to solve a puzzle in order to reach the Haligtree.
Good luck upgrading your flasks in Elden Ring!</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/elden_ring_golden_seed_location_1.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/elden_ring_golden_seed_location_1.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Elden Ring Golden Seed locations -
