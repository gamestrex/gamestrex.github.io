You’ll also learn about World Level and when it’s possible to decrease it. On this page: The best way to earn Adventure EXP is from completing Quests, such as story quests, event quests, and the Daily Commissions, which unlock at Adventure Rank 12. You also gain Adventure EXP with every chest you open, by completing investigation objectives in your Adventurer Handbook, or by completing Ley Line Blossom or Domain challenges, which also contribute to farming resources to level up your characters. As well as the story quests, Daily Commissions are the easiest way to gain Adventure EXP, with each commission earning you 225 Adventure EXP, and these are usually very quick to complete too. Once you complete all four and report to Katheryne at any of the Adventurer’s Guild branches, you’ll gain a further 500 Adventure Rank EXP. These commissions also award Primogems used for using Wishes. Once your Adventure Rank gauge has maxed up to a new level, you just need to visit Katheryne at any of the Adventurer’s Guild branches to both begin building up Adventure EXP for your next Adventure Rank and obtain your rewards. There are specific story points where you will be required to reach a certain Adventure Rank before you can proceed. All current features in Genshin Impact will be unlocked by the time you have reached Adventure Rank 35. Those who wish to advance to the story in Inazuma will need to be at Adventure Rank 40. In order to completely max out your character to Lv. 90 you will need to be at Adventure Rank 50. Past this point, getting to the maximum Adventure Rank 60 is a very long grind, because of how much Adventure EXP is required., Tthough, at this point, there are no other current story points or features to unlock, so it’s not as essential. Should you reach the maximum Adventure Rank, any extra Adventure EXP earned will be converted to Mora. Some Adventure Rank levels will also unlock new gameplay features, including more efficient ways to grind for necessary materials and resources for leveling up your characters. If you are playing as the Traveler -, the protagonist of Genshin Impact, then certain Adventure Ranks also reward you with Brilliant Diamond pieces, which are essential for allowing you to ascend them to a higher level threshold. After reaching certain Adventure Ranks, the Adventurer’s Guild will also post an emergency relic commission, which must be completed in order to raise the maximum Adventure Rank. Completing these commissions also raises the World level. Rewards for these commissions include 100 Primogems, 2 Acquaint Fates, and Mora, increasing by 10,000 per Ascension Quest. Here are the rewards you’ll receive from achieving each Adventure Rank in Genshin Impact: Genshin Impact version 3.3 is here, with new codes, and new character Scaramouche (Wanderer), so find out where he’s placed on our tier list. You’ll need Primogems and luck of the Pity and 50/50 systems to Wish with Fate for him and other current and next banners. You’ll also need the right Adventure Rank for events. For more Sumeru help, we’ve got pages on Sumeru Reputation, Tree of Dreams, Dendroculus locations, the Aeonblight Drake boss, the Garden of Endless Pillars Domain, and locations for Nilotpala Lotus, Padisarah, Scarabs, and Redcrest.\rYou can also now unlock the Genius Invokation TCG and, if you want help building your deck, check out our Genius Invokation TCG Card List.\rIf you want to relax, however, why not try fishing at one of the many fishing spot locations?\rAs your Adventure Rank increases, so does your World Level. After your Adventure Rank reaches 20, your World Level increases by 1, and then rises every 5 Adventure Rank levels once you’ve been to the Adventurer’s Guild to collect your reward. The maximum Adventure Rank is 60 and the maximum World Level is 8. In most cases, they will be in relative parity so that enemies don’t become more powerful than what you can handle. This will, of course, depend on your character’s levels. If you have not been levelling up your roster, it’s unwise to rush ahead to advance the Adventure Rank and World Levels, as you may find your team underlevelled for the next challenge, and you’re unable to decrease the World Level until you have at least reached World Level 5. If you’re playing co-op with a friend, you must also be of the same World Level. If you’re not feeling ready to advance to the next World Level then we recommend not collecting your reward at the Adventurer’s Guild, but be aware that you will not be able make progress on your next Adventure Rank until you do so. Because some story quests are locked until you have reached a certain Adventure Rank, you should nonetheless find that you should have ample opportunity to upgrade your character’s gear, weapons and abilities so that you’re capable of facing the next challenge. At Adventure Ranks 25, 35, 45, and 50, you will also need to complete an Adventure Rank Ascension Quest before you can increase your Maximum Adventure Rank and World Level, so you can consider these as skill checks to ensure your team isn’t underlevelled. If things do get too challenging later, then, after reaching World Level 5, you will have the option to decrease your World Level by 1. This option can be found by opening the main menu and selecting the ‘i’ icon next to World level (or press up on PlayStation). From the window that pops up, scroll to the bottom and you will find the option to change the World Level. This will lower the level of enemies in the game, but also decreases the rewards you gain from defeating them. You will have another window to confirm this, but be aware that, once you have confirmed the change, you’ll need to wait for 24 hours before you can change it back. Similarly, if you decide to increase the World Level, you’ll also have to wait 24 hours before you can decrease it again. We hope this all prepares you for climbing the Adventure Ranks and facing the increasing challenges in Genshin Impact!\n","wordCount":"1089","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-30T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-30T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Willie Burris"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/how-to-increase-adventure-rank-and-world-level-in-genshin-impact/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>How To Increase Adventure Rank And World Level In Genshin Impact</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 30, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1089 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Willie Burris</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>Increasing your Adventure Rank will also grant you rewards, such as resources for levelling up your characters and weapons, including Primogems required for you to make Wishes in your chance to unlock new playable characters.
