Some of the machines encountered in the opening of the series Zero Dawn will also be present in the next sequel, Horizon Forbidden West. Looks like a small fumble, these machines patrol larger herds and scan for potential threats. Or the wolf, crocodile-like animals which were created so far to purify water and go feral as a consequence of the derangement. The Forbidden West is full of new dangers in the Horizon Forbidden West trailer. Aloy meets many of them, such as the fast and agile Clawstrider and the deadly mammoth-like Tremortusk. Of course there will be lots more machines to fight or be mounted or run from. So Aloy and you need to be prepared for any kind of circumstances in these forsaken lands.\nAwe-inspiring metal beasts are the shining end of the sky. The principal machine designer, Blake Politeski, was with Guerrilla since the first machine was first designed at Horizon Zero Dawn. Their teams collaborated with Asset Art Lead Maxim Fleury on some exciting updates for the next sequel. We have begun to explore a new area of the world of Horizon. It was interesting to understand which kind of machines were living in different ecological zones, and how they would interact with each other, their environment and – naturally, their humans. Machines are the so-called caretakers of the world. I think it was always interesting to think of how they perform their roles and how it is capable of playing these kinds of games to try the best. During the work of Horizon Zero Dawns, the whole world had a ton of ideas of course not everything could make it into the first game, but now with Horizon Forbidden West we have managed to match all of the interesting ideas that were previously impossible by new and interesting ideas! Maxim says, Blakes has created a design document for us explaining the general look of the machine, its shape and how much use it has on its own, and how much damage it can cause. Several top-level drawings can explain the document further, but then the real visual design moves further towards the Robot and Weapon Asset team. Eventually, the concept artist will create a 3D idea which goes through some reviews of art direction, game design, animation, and technical art teams, until we’re all happy. I’ll create, rig and animate the model so that it can see if everything was working as needed. After that, the models on the team of Robotics and Weapons and the other team will work on it, adding in all the details. After several more iterations with different teams, the model is largely animated, painted, textured, and reviewed then was added to the games and replaced the temporary model. It’s a long time for the development of this machine.\nExpanding the machine catalog. The job that included over 25 different machines in Horizon Zero Dawn was not easy. In the first game we had to create the foundation, says Blake. So we started small by defining different roles. The Watcher is a security camera, and that Ravager is an enforcer, etc. Once the base roles were decided, we could begin a real build on that with that combined in robot designs, unique abilities and abilities, and of course cool weapons and attacks. We’re expanding this catalog further with the Horizon Forbidden West. For example, we knew we wanted a slightly bigger flying machine than the Glinthawk, which resulted in the Sunwing, but it needed a place and a role in the world. We studied different flying reptiles and primitive birds as inspiration and developed the idea of their wings collecting solar energy during the cloudy weather. This eventually creates an interesting game dynamic. Sunwings will be vulnerable when they harvest solar power but also more alert to potential predators when they are idle. These unique behaviors become the basis of these actions and are now expanded to define the machine’s human powers. I always want to keep the machines connected, and that they serve more purpose. Therefore, the whole machine (eco-)system is as harmonious as the real world. Guerrilla was always committed to creating a authentic world. It includes constructing authentic machines that roam the world of the world of the Horizon. The design language that was created with Horizon Zero Dawn is still very important to us, explains Maxim. Gleichzeitig, we’ll try to make the new machines different and unique so we can expand our players’ world. These machines have much more functionality this time around, which is a design challenge that seems to be a way of thinking, but that is a good way to have fun in every encounter.\nYoung and dangerous foes are dangerous and deadly creatures. In a post on the Forbidden West, we discussed her abilities and combat moves in the Asylvanian wilderness. Some of the things you can use against slower, faster machines, and more expensive machines. Aloy has many different weapons and ammunition available, and she will need all these machines to defeat the different machines! says Maxim. Without spoiling anything, nobody can make a lot of mistakes. We tried to teach players the importance of machine design and added textures that show weak points or interactive components. You should study each machine closely so you can find different ways to approach it. Blake adds that many machines have different weapons and behavior that will have a common use, which can be simulated to be the result of an advantage. There isn’t only shooting off complexes and using them, but some machines might have a few more passive states to prevent the player from turning toward them. For example, when a machine is digging a lot of resources in the ground, it will create dust. Aloy can use this as a visual cover and get closer. Because of this, Aloy needs new motion mechanics to help him. We were focused on Aloys ability to survey and plan an encounter before engaging, as well as her ability to escape if things don’t go as planned. Actions like climbing or taking Smoke Bombs to escape can improve the ability of Aloy in a machine battle. Thankfully it’s not the mechanics that have been improved. In the Forbidden West there are more dangerous machines, but player can understand their behavior and predict their movements using audio cues. For example, a machine can sound like lightning, alerting others and initiating attacks. For the PlayStation 5 version, this will come through with 3D Audio, providing a great sense of situation by one’s large world, combined with compatible device like stereo headphones (analogue or USB).\nMeet the Smurfs. During the movie “Avalon Forbidden West,” Aloy goes head to head with one of the biggest enemies we have seen so far: a Tremortusk. Although it is a true sight, it can be extremely difficult to win. The Tremortusk is based on a mammoth-like plot based on the earliest historical, cinematic examples of great war elephants. There are several different attacks on this body, while a body covered with many guns is covered. It doesn’t just use tusks to attacks close-by, but also has different elemental weapons that can be used. There’s a rebel faction in the Tenakth that is a group of those who are also trying to wander, explains Maxim. It reminds me of a combination of war elephants and a huge siege tower that was used to attack fortresses during medieval times: hard to destroy, slow moving, and much fire power, recollects Blake. That created the idea for the 3th Tremortusk, a well armored, but slow machine that is nearly an unstoppable force. It seems like a natural fit to combine the two and make the own spin on war elephants. There is a platform on top that humans can fire at Aloy. To make the cycle back to the machine (eco-), the body was created to keep in balance on Earth and keep the world’s balance low. Tremortusks were created as combat machines, so they can do what they were designed to do without human interference. Both Blake and Maxim agree that the Tremortusk is one of the most formidable enemies in the game, requiring a lot of preparation to defeat. We recommend the use of traps and Pullcaster as well. However slow, they can reach a speed that easily trample Aloy, so get ready to dodge. Be careful with your flamethrower trunk.\nTurn the tide by a wind blow! Even though most machines are looking for a fight, they are very powerful in a huge way or contribute to the world of Horizon, or offer Aloy her whole journey. Think of Tallnecks that are not hostile, and then will give Aloy some clarity and direction if overridden! Aloy can revert to Horizon Zero Dawn, which’s similar to hers, and help them fight with her, says Maxim. This time, we added a few more helmets for the game, which allows you to see her on the Clawstrider. Blake added: Some machines may also inadvertently help Aloy out. If a machine is searching for resources such as Aloy, they can send her to stashes, even if she’s looking for information. Aloy has now overridden machines and now has some control, shifting them to aggressive or defensive states. All the people at Guerrilla are going to think of the latest machines for themselves. Of course, we have our own machine in the studio; for Maxim, the Thunderjaw is his favorite. It was the first machine from Star Zero Dawn, and I felt a sense of concept; so it always reshaped me. I love the design and design of the house. As in the Horizon Forbidden West, nifty little machines will do everything you need to do to be careful of if you don’t take a seriously serious action. And, you’re not your favorite, like Bill. The wolf is the stormbird. This is one of our first, and we’re trying to figure out what these machines should be. When I pitched the idea to a colleague, it looked like a eagle combined with a fighter jet. But then it turned out to be elemental with a surge of electricity rising above the sky. It would dive right to the player like a flurry of lightning and explode as it hit the ground! Our Game Director hears this conversation, turns around and said: This sounds awesome. So that’s how we figured out the Stormbird. So far as I like the shellsnapper, my favorite is the most popular. It’s the machine that began to work in my mind and it’s exciting as soon as I see it in the Forbidden West. It is large and has several abilities that are ideal for young people, and as well as give out a kick from the likes of movies and real life. I am just as excited to see people react to this game as they will play it. Whats your favorite machine from Horizon Zero Dawn? Or the one you’d like most to discover in Horizon Forbidden West?
