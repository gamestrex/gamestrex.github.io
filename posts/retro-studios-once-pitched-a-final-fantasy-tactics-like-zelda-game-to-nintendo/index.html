The titular heroes of Hyrule would have been Dunar the Goron (a &ldquo;gruff, tough fighter&rdquo; who &ldquo;embodied the triforce of power&rdquo;), Seriph the Rito (a &ldquo;patient [and] warm-hearted rito&rdquo; who embodied the triforce of courage"), and Krel the Zora (yes, you guessed it, he embodied the Triforce of Wisdom and is described as being &ldquo;cynical&rdquo; but with a &ldquo;warm heart&rdquo;).
