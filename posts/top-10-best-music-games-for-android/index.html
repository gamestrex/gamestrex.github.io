We will give you a little more information to each app, and a link for you to download for free. Everything from downloading to running the Google Play Store is accessible. It’s always recommended that users download apps from an authorized app store or Google Play.\nBeat Blade Download cost: $50. For each piece, the cost is 99.99 dollars. Size: 120 MB. Google Play score is 4,3 stars out of 5 stars.\nBeat Blade brings interesting rhythm games. It took from the aesthetic to the idea obvious inspiration. However, instead of boxes coming toward you, your character is heading off a path, and it’s your job to steer the character into them. There’s actually a story mode in Beat Blade that you can follow. During the campaign you play live streams – with each round of that stream a live stream. You get a fake streamer setup, and after each round you earn more followers. With every step of your career, you’re going to get a loyal base. You’re definitely going to be in-app purchases and ads during that game. It is not only the energy supply, but also the energy industry. Also beware of the problem. These coins earn money during gameplay, so you can use them to buy songs and adapt a character. Download and download Beat Blade.\nBeat Star Price: 10 to pay. In-App Cost:.99 $ 99.9 $. Size: 165 Mbs. Google Play: 4.6 stars from five.\nBeat Star is a classic rhythm game, but it has its own style. In terms of gameplay, it can’t really flip the script as you are wearing notes that you tap, hold, and slide. It is quite a little under the pressure of manipulating its work, but it seems to be quite the opposite of itself. With Beat Star, musicians pick songs from the biggest musicians of today. When you listen to modern music, you’ll probably find your favorite song in this game. If you want to earn songs, you can play rounds, level up and unlock them with chests. In-app purchases aren’t really a big thing in this game, and there aren’t any ads. You can get a bundle of treasures and songs that feature top-class currency. And, not all that, you’re in the habit of playing the game to get ahead. Download Beat Star.\nD4DJ Costs: $99 download. In-App Price: 9,99 $ 16,99 $. Size: 118MB. Google Play rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars.\nD4DJ takes the mobile rhythm game genre and gives it anime flair. As with any rhythm game, you have to hit the notes in time to gain points. There’s some interesting thing about this game: that the game is really nuanced. There are notes you need to tap, hold, slide and swipe. There is a lot to D4DJ that includes characters, unlockable content, and a story mode with fully voiced cutscenes (and thus are their in Japanese). As to the story, you play as a group of talented DJs who tour the world. That is pretty much that. I have to say that this is a quintessential game. You’re bombarded with gores, special events, a system of energy and more. However, you can get some good gameplay without having to pay. Download D4DJ\nDeemo Download: Free. In-store cost: No less than $5. Size: 8MB Google Play is 4.9 stars out of five.\nBecause of his appearance and song selection, Deemo is different from most rhythm games. Many rhythm games use different songs from the modern popular, but Deemo is a different form of playing the melody. It will be fun to hear music from indie composers and songwriters. You won’t hear music on the radio, so there’s nothing wrong with that. The music of this game covers an incredible range of colours and colors. The music is diverse, eccentric, and much more. The company recently turned the free version of the game into a full version. You won’t receive an app and no ads. You also get access to over 280 songs. Download Deemo\nEvery detail is clear and true. Download cost: free. In-App cost: 9,99 $. Dimension: 37 m. Google Play’s rating is 4,5 stars out of five.\nLost in harmony is in contrast with all rhythm games. While you would like to avoid obstacles such as those coming on the path, the old fashioned path would be better off for others. You play two types of characters who skate over a variety of different paths. There will be a lot of different obstacles you must avoid. Those can come from behind, with you and with you. It also sticks out because of its song choice. While most rhythm games only use the latest pop, rap and rock hits, Lost In Harmony uses remixed versions of classical pieces. There are also a few original compositions thrown in. All of the gear and mood changes dramatically during the round. You earn cash in the play so you can customize your character. There’s an energy system, but you can take unlimited turns for an average of 2,99 dollars. On all the levels, you can be freed for the same price. Download by accident / Lost in Harmony for free.\nMagic Piano Download price: Free! Is this price in-app? $99.99? Size: 333 MB Google Play rating. 4.4 stars out of five.\nMagic Piano abides true to its name, as it is the whole arrangement for piano. All these piano pieces are arranged for popular songs. All the notes are represented in dots that you should tap. The Magic piano is different because the song is to remember the playing. Since you want to slow down, the song will slowly fade. This means playing hard, but that way you get some expression to play. Once you rise to the stage, you earn money and use them to buy more songs. If you want unlimited access to the songs, you can either pay for a total of $4.99 per month or for a total of $39.99 per year. Download the magic piano.\nRhythm Star For download, please pay for anything. In-app cost: €19.99. Size: 140 KB Google Play Rating: 4 yen.\nRhythm Star is adding a little character to the arcade game. The title is 100% with unlockable characters, character summons and so on. This game is typically a rhythm game where one must track the notes in time. There is a battle element added to spice things up. In the campaign mode, if you hit the notes, your characters are attacking enemies up to the top. Getting longer combos helps your characters attack strength. Besides modern music, the old-fashioned works come out beautifully. They all have its full range of style and energy. You’ll unlock a lot of songs to play and play as you progress. Download The Rhythm Star.\nRolling Beat Download cost: Free. No deposit at the price of that item. Size: 53MB Google Play rating: 4.2 stars out of 5 stars.\nRolling Beat is a rhythm game that involves playing it like a ball in the middle of the tunnel. The light is clear. As a rhythm game, it looks like an crystal. The look, the effect and the taste of the design are classic futuristic. Everything is dark black with colorful accents everywhere. You can change balls with different skins that you can create while playing. As you play, the color scheme changes so that people can appreciate things. Rolling Beat doesn’t have any in-app purchases, but ads. You can watch a film and listen to the songs and react to it, if you hit the hurdles. Also, you can use the coin in-game to buy songs. Download the Rolling Beat.\nSmash 3D color. Take off a ride. Cost of in-app: 99 – 99 $. Size: 122 MB. Google Play rating: 4,3 stars out of 5 stars.\nSmash Ball combines rhythm games into the 3D world. Instead of hitting notes on a 2-D plane, its a ball flying through 3D space. When you fly, you are going to find colored plates. You must hit the ball’s plate. The plates are going to fly together with the music playing. Smash Ball 3D uses all the most popular music that is available today, among others, funk, eagle, etc. As the difficulty grows, the plates will shrink, move and come in different forms. You’ll definitely find ads and in-app purchases with this game. You earn diamonds while you play stage, and you use those to unlock more songs. If you want to save all the ads and unlock all of the content, then you can join a VIP club. You have three dollars. Download Smash Colors 3D.\nSongPop 3 The cost is pretty good. Prices for the house: £99 $99. Size: 420 m Google Play rating is four thousand stars out of five.\nSongpop 3 is not a rhythm game, it is a trivia game that teaches you the best way to know music. During a round, a clip of a song will play. You must do your best before the clip ends. Some songs also draw up a few questions about which the artist is to blame. In every round, you can guess five songs. Songpop is a competitive game. You can make rounds and challenge other players to score at the top of the field. Their goal is to give the correct answers as you do, or to answer the right answers faster than you do. There are several large musical types, from the 60s to modern. You’ve got the basics in a game like ads, premium memberships and in-app purchases. You can watch the ads to unlock some of the songs, but premium memberships remove the ads, and we will unlock most of the music. Download SongPop 3 version of the song.\n","wordCount":"1773","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tony Foster"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/top-10-best-music-games-for-android/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Top 10 Best Music Games For Android</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-29 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 29, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1773 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Tony Foster</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#the-10-best-music-games-for-android>The 10 Best Music Games For Android.</a></li><li><a href=#top-10-best-mobile-music-game-downloads-for-android>Top 10 best mobile music game downloads for Android.</a></li><li><a href=#beat-blade>Beat Blade</a></li><li><a href=#beat-star>Beat Star</a></li><li><a href=#d4dj>D4DJ</a></li><li><a href=#deemo>Deemo</a></li><li><a href=#every-detail-is-clear-and-true>Every detail is clear and true.</a></li><li><a href=#magic-piano>Magic Piano</a></li><li><a href=#rhythm-star>Rhythm Star</a></li><li><a href=#rolling-beat>Rolling Beat</a></li><li><a href=#smash-3d-color>Smash 3D color.</a></li><li><a href=#songpop-3>SongPop 3</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>These games are perfect for music lovers and musicians who want to be exposed to the other forms of music.

Google Play rating: 4,3 stars out of 5 stars.</p><p>Smash Ball combines rhythm games into the 3D world. Instead of hitting notes on a 2-D plane, its a ball flying through 3D space. When you fly, you are going to find colored plates. You must hit the ball’s plate.
The plates are going to fly together with the music playing. Smash Ball 3D uses all the most popular music that is available today, among others, funk, eagle, etc. As the difficulty grows, the plates will shrink, move and come in different forms.

Size: 420 m Google Play rating is four thousand stars out of five.</p><p>Songpop 3 is not a rhythm game, it is a trivia game that teaches you the best way to know music. During a round, a clip of a song will play. You must do your best before the clip ends. Some songs also draw up a few questions about which the artist is to blame. In every round, you can guess five songs.
Songpop is a competitive game. You can make rounds and challenge other players to score at the top of the field. Their goal is to give the correct answers as you do, or to answer the right answers faster than you do. There are several large musical types, from the 60s to modern.
You’ve got the basics in a game like ads, premium memberships and in-app purchases. You can watch the ads to unlock some of the songs, but premium memberships remove the ads, and we will unlock most of the music.
