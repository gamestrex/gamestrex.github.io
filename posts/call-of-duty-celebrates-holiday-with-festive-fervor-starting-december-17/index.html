In honor of the holidays, Vanguard will roll out a variety of multiplayer features. All in name of good cheer. Let’s start with a closer look at those festive foes you’ll encounter in the field and where the development team draws inspiration. Elf Team Six: Search and destroy fabled Elf Team Six, hidden around Vanguards Multiplayer maps, to earn Killstreak progress and score added. Always try to walk before you leave. Developing Outsights: It is an old tradition that keeps an elf secret for people to find is something that the team at Raven wanted to poke fun at. The team felt that those who care about this tradition prefer to get that annoying elf out of their ear. I decided to let you do that. It was fun to put together Elf and Seek development in the studio. Seeing the pesky elf in the new map, allowing people to find small nooks, make people think about it, and it is enjoyable to see it and to see it as a creature. They’re creepy, I mean. We are really excited to see how fun rewards a game offers to win the elves. We placed them all over the Caldera and hope you’re a little fun finding them and taking them out to the end, or whatever you want! Please keep out of the protests in action! The folk-horror figure Krampus will appear in designated multiplayer matches to hunt down those who have ignored the objective. Isn’t there time on the hardpoint? Haven’t you taken a single Domination flag? There’s no doubt that he is coming for you. Developer Insights: After the devs at Raven learned about the Krampus after getting caught eating chocolate, they became fans of this mythical and simply terrifying Anti-Santa. As soon as they got the opportunity to buy Krampus in Warzone, they couldn’t wait. The goal of Ravens was to create a game that would show players what it’s like to attend a blustery contract carried out by a demon! Since the team developed the Krampus, they discovered how it could get at a time when it approached them and pick their victims. They tested these decisions in play tests and saw what was extremely satisfying for the players. Raven was designed for Krampus for a robust NPC system. They hope you enjoyed taking him downor you know the latter. For those Krampus hunters there is a hidden gift for you. Armageddon: Get a gripped with Care Packs and add a grip to the Team Deathmatch. As per previous titles, teams fight for control of a designated area where care packages will continue to drop for the taking. Open your Killstreaks and spread the cheer. Unfortunately, the obedient Elf Team Six and vengeful Krampus aren’t contained within Multiplayer. Keep reading to learn how these wintery warriors play in the Pacific Ocean. The world of events brings together the greatness and a love of politics and entertainment. Other seasonal visuals like domination and Hardpoint take over the wintery base of Stalingrad in Der Beginn in Zombies.\nVanguard owners also have extra gifts. If the reward is given to those who buy or have already bought Vanguard by December 31. It is a free Warzone – the 22 Vanguard Violations as shown in the prelaunch season six pass, a third win at the original 3 o’clock.\nGet your festive bundles. Get into the Festive Fervor spirit with new holiday-themed bundles for use in the State of Hawaii and \u0026 the Pacific Ocean. From the naughty to the nice, we have covered you with these four Bundles. The Santas Slay Bundle: Deck the halls with new Legendary Weapons with red-and-green Tracers and a Finishing Move that uses a helpful Elf companion. Count yourself for your foes, as you win with Lucas for his ugly-sweater Scarlet Burner. To see the Boiler, see the Ovale. You’ll also get the Legendary Krampusnacht Marksman Rifle Blueprint, and the Reindog Rampage Finishing Move to enlighten your enemies to a festive end. What a surprise your opponents get is this pack with two legendary weapons Blueprints: one for a pump-action shotgun and another which turns a Marksman Rifle into a full-blown beast. Broken Resolutions: Your broken resolutions won’t come soon. The Battle Pass Tier will pass, with the Legendary and Epic Operator, Armory and Player Profile pieces. For the Pop Bottles Finishing Move, the sleek Midnighter Operation Skin for Beatrice and the Cover Charge Assault Rifle, just in time for that.\nComplete and earn rewards. All players are able to complete Vanguard Multiplayer or Warzone Pacific during the Festive Fervor event. In Vanguard the challenges include the elimination of holiday nuisances across multiplayer modes, playing Shipmas, and opening Care Packages like presents under the tree. The rewards include the Battle Pass Tier Skip, a Double XP Token, and your weapons and your player’s profile.\nSpread cheer for the Warzone Pacific, too. In front of Vanguard, Caldera and Rebirth Island will host their own limited-time celebrations. Special Fir Trees: In Caldera see Special Fir Trees spread over the entire island. Speciality-filled events are promoted by a few Supply Boxes, including Holiday Crates which have Legendaries, limited-time rewards, or even coal for Operators on the naughty list. Developer Insight: Get into the Halls. As a family during the holiday season, giant battles can cause even death. Raven just made it into the next level in Warzone. The devs will battle the forest, and whoever uses this tenacity aims to give it to they get up to the top. Is snowball in those chests also, and who doesn’t like to throw snowballs? Raven hopes it will spark a great player story, like that of holding Domination points. Their advice isn’t too greedy. If you hit coal in a crate because you’re naughty, you’re next for Krampus. The team wanted to have Krampus connected with this and make a player quiet, so I must have opened that chest? Keep in mind that Krampus spends his holidays cross Caldera and Rebirth Island, so the giant hunts for sport on both maps. He prefers hunting those who don’t receive coal from Holiday Crates. The creature will take a full time hunting each target before moving to the next, until he is absorbed and will reward the squad with a special permanent match reward that eliminates him. The wolf is a wolf. A witch can be an explorer. Find and destroy these holiday gnomes to receive rewards such as a Double XP Token or Calling Card. In the Pacific Ocean, those seeking extra rewards can also complete six unique challenges, each with a reward like a Battle Pass, Double XP Token, and more.\nTwelve days of deals in duty: Black Ops Cold War! For six seasons of content, Black Ops Cold War brought a variety of Bundles for the players in Black Ops and Warzone. For those who missed out, nows your chance to make amends to twelve Days of Deals. From December 14th, a selection of Bundles from the Black Ops Cold War and the Warzone are returning with holiday discounts. Each day leading up to December 25 will become available 5 Black-Ops Cold War Bundles in the game and in the Pacific Coast. Most are returning classics with special discounts, but expect one new bundle: Battle Pass Vault Pack Greatest Hits, a collection of late-Tier content from the first three Black Ops Cold War ‘Taylor.\nSupport Veterans this Holiday Season. It’s finally here. Call of Duty Endowment is honored to be one of the 14 beneficiaries of this years Jingle Jam. When it comes to its 10th anniversary, Jingle Jam is the largest charity event in the gaming industry to raise over 20 million dollars since 2011.
