From the beginning of Blood and Wine, but a farewell to that horror-slaying RPG, the Geralt is still on our minds with the release of The Witcher Season 2. Maybe the Witcher TV show has sent you a read of the books, or a new play of Wild Hunt, with different conclusions? There are 36 types of variations all in between for Ciri’s fate, so you should start to draw a specific Witcher 3 ending right away. As far as I know, you don’t want to remember which little, sometimes or so much more complex and meaningless details and a specific rule, but these list would give you the specifics. There is also an end for Blood and Wine, so you can retire Geralt as quickly as possible.\nWitcher 3 ending. Between power, love triangles and wandering non-humanes that fill The Continent, there are 36 possible witcher three endings. The most important factor of which is fate of the Geralts companion, Ciriaffects only three of the games biggest conclusions. When it comes to determining what happens to him, there are numerous key decisions to decide on to the second and third acts, which will be used all the time. Please advise, that from here there are a lot of characters that are spoilers of The Witcher 3 here.\nCiri Dies In what is considered the worst game ending, Ciri dies during her fight against the dreadful White Frost. Because of this, you will have to get some of the same consequences that are not worth the money, not all of them.\nAfter the battle of Kaer Morhen telling Ciri you shouldn’t be good at everything invites her to the castle for a drink, but fails to relax. When Ciri informs you of the Whereabouts of Imlerith, if you encourage her to visit her father, Emhyr, and then accept her reward for finding him, she will be very upset. When Ciri visits the Lodge of Sorceresses, accompanying her to the meeting with Phillippa Eilhart knocks her confidence. In the room of Avallachs lab, telling Ciri to calm down frustrates her. When Ciri asks Geralt to visit Skjalls grave with her, telling her she doesn’t have time to go out and down.\nMaking three or two of these choices does not mean that Ciri’s faith in herself as she prepares for the White Frost. She never goes to the Continent. Continuing her battle in the air, Geralt is chubby for a thief.\nCiri Lives It’s the best ending for Geralt to guide Ciri in preparation for the battle. To do that, he has to make three positive choices: one.\nAfter the Battle of Kaer Morhen, telling Ciri that you know what might lift your spirits will trigger a snowball fight, cheering her up after her disagreement with Avallach. Ciri wakes Geralt and hunts for Imlerith, taking her straight to Velen skips the scene with Emhyr, and counts as an opportune choice. The Lodge welcomes the organisers of the meeting with Phillippa, who enshrined him to join in on Ciri. The trick is to save the time, to waste the Avallachs lab. Visiting the grave of Skjall raises her confidence in the confrontation with the villagers.\nHaving chosen at least three of these options allows Ciri to return to The Continent after defeating the White Frost. At the end of the game, Geralt met her in a tavern and gave her a specially-crafted sword. The two then travel together on the path as witches.\nEmpress Cirilla If Ciri survives her battle as you helped Nilfgaard win the war her father convince her that while a force for good is thrown in the world, she needs to return home to rule. In a bittersweet ending, the mermaid is escorted back to the Emperor. You will still need to have picked at least three positive outcomes for the ending. In order to deliver this ending, taking Ciri on Emhyr is the only choice that gives him another chance of having bothered this end.\nWitcher Three ends with Blood and Wine. Of course, the events above aren’t the point where the story of Geralts ends. Blood and Wine has three major endings that relate to the fate of its central characters: Duchess Anna Henrietta, Syanna, her estranged sister, and vampire Detlaff.\nBlood (bath) and grapes eat. In Blood and Wines ‘worst ending’, everybody dies. During the Night of the Long Fangs quest, if you choose to seek the undiscovered vampire, you’ll be forced to kill Detlaff. Eventually, when Syanna and Anna were seated on the palace grounds, you won’t be able to kill her brother, where she has been shot by Damien, the guard captain. If you choose to find Syanna (with either Damien or Orianna), you can enter an enchanting Fairy Tale world called “Land of Thousand Hungers”. There are many ways to purchase a ribbon. Take it to protect Syanna from Detlaff, during the Tesham Mutna quest, and you’ll also get Regis help to kill the vampire. If you don’t investigate Syanna further, you won’t have to. But the fear is against Syanna from killing Anna Henrietta. If you ignore her vigilance with no conviction to’syanna’ of her sisters, he stabs Anna Henrietta.\nA beautiful vintage, please. There’s no way to keep all of you alive. For the expansion’s best ending, it’s OK to kill Detlaff and save the sisters. To achieve that, seek out Syanna during the Night of the Long Fangs, enter the Fairy Tale world, take the ribbon and defeat Detlaff. You will need to do all the following for sure. To make sure Syanna does not give Anna his name, let’s say that she can’t beat Anna in time for it.\nBefore entering the Fairy Tale world, read the five journal entries from the palace nursery. In The Fairy Tale world, tell Syanna youve come to free her and listen to all her optional dialogue choices. You need to find the ribbon in this little girl’s shirt and to allow Syanna to explain why she has been in hiding from the Duchy. After leaving Fairy Tale, continue to investigate Syanna in return for the bootblack. Hell point your direction towards the beggars paid to inform Detlaff of the names of his victims; from whom you should confiscate this letter. After learning that Anna Henrietta was to be Syanna’s last victim, confront him and tell him that you understand that her sister turned him back on you. Then ask if shed ever thought to forgive her, and tell her the truth. Anna Henrietta did her wrong when she was a child.\nIf you do that in the correct order, the Duchess forgives her sister and they’ll embrace her, and everyone lives happily ever after.\nBeing non-human is a matter of non-humanity. The third witcher 3 finish will be clumsy, as it involves the death of Syanna before she begins studying. If you are looking for her during the Long Fangs, but if you don’t take the ribbon in Fairy Tale, Detlaff kills her at Tesham Mutna. You can choose to kill Detlaff or let him escape, but the Duchess won’t be a bit too impressed either way. Geralt was sent in prison by the letting that Syanna die, relying on Dandelion to free her. And no matter what happens, Blood and Wine will come to an end, when Geralt returns to his vineyard. As soon as he arrives, he has informed the man, who came and saw him. Their identity is based on your choices in the main game; if you chose the appropriate romantic option, Yennefer joins you while, if you’re wrong, it’ll be Yennefer [you’re on thin ice, Jones Ed]. Unless you do not choose either Ciri or her mother, she’ll arrive as a witch. But if your Ciri ending was that she lost her battle against the White Frost, Dandelion visits her. The Continent remains in a good state based on a lot more choices made throughout the Witcher 3. Geralt swayed over the result of the war with Nilfgaard (and the fate of his emperor), and the Skelligan succession, and the destinies of multiple minor characters (and often their family and friends). But when all the narratives intersect, it’s importance to Geralt and the larger world of The Witcher shaped each major ending. Watch her and everything else is over.\n","wordCount":"1430","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-08T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-08T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Catherine Nelson"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/how-to-get-all-witcher-3-endings/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>How To Get All Witcher 3 Endings</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-08 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 8, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1430 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Catherine Nelson</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#witcher-3-ending>Witcher 3 ending.</a><ul><li><a href=#ciri-dies>Ciri Dies</a></li><li><a href=#ciri-lives>Ciri Lives</a></li><li><a href=#empress-cirilla>Empress Cirilla</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#witcher-three-ends-with-blood-and-wine>Witcher Three ends with Blood and Wine.</a><ul><li><a href=#blood-bath-and-grapes-eat>Blood (bath) and grapes eat.</a></li><li><a href=#a-beautiful-vintage-please>A beautiful vintage, please.</a></li><li><a href=#being-non-human-is-a-matter-of-non-humanity>Being non-human is a matter of non-humanity.</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>(Image: RED), CD (Image)
