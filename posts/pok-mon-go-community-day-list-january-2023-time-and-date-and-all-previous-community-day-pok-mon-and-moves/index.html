It’s a great way to get resources and a rare version of the highlighted Pokémon, but it’s as the name suggests, is a great way to team up with other players. You may find other Pokémon Go players will be out and about with you, which might make it easier to co-ordinate completing Raids or doing Trades, so keep that in mind during the period. Highlighted Pokémon: Chespin Date: Saturday, 7th January Time: 2pm to 5pm local time Bonus 1: Double catch candy Bonus 2: Double chance to receive XL Candy from catching Pokémon for players Level 31 or above Bonus 3: 1/4 Hatch Distance when Eggs are placed in an Incubator during the event period Bonus 4: Lure Modules activated during the event will last three hours Bonus 5: Incense activated during the event will last three hours Bonus 6: Trades during event and up to five hours afterwards will require 50% less Stardust Bonus 7: Can conduct one additional Special Trade can be conducted between 2pm to 10pm (local time), for a total of three Special Trades on that day Bonus 8: A number of snapshots will have a photobomb Exclusive move for evolution (Chesnaught): Frenzy Plant (Grass-type Charged attack) Bonus Raids: From 5pm to 10pm on the Community Day, you’ll be able to battle Quilladin in four-star raids. If you defeat Quilladin in one of these raids, then Chespin will appear around the Gym which hosted it for 30 minutes and will have the same increased shiny rate as those which appeared during the Community Day. These raids can not be joined using a Remote Raid Pass. How useful is this Community Day? This Community Day is perfect for newcomers who might not have Chespin and its evolutions in their Pokédex yet, because, since Chespin is a starter Pokémon, it can be rather hard to find. Thanks to the increased number of Chespins appearing during the Community Day event, you’ll easily be able to collect enough candy to fully evolve this little grass-type! Long time Pokémon Go players, however, can still enjoy the hunt during this Community Day, because it sees the release of shiny Chespin! Thanks to Community Day event’s increased shiny rates, you’ve got a good chance of catching a number of shiny Chespin, which you can then evolve into a shiny Quilladin and Chesnaught. Sadly, if you’re a Go Battle League fan, you may find this Community Day underwhelming, because, even with its new exclusive move, Chesnaught doesn’t hold much weight in the meta. This is due to it being outstripped by other grass and fighting-type Pokémon. Here’s everything you need to know about January’s Community Day Classic: Highlighted Pokémon: Larvitar Date: Saturday, 21st January Time: 2pm to 5pm (local time) Bonus 1: x3 Catch XP Bonus 2: Lure Modules activated during the event will last for three hours Bonus 3: Incense activated during the event will last for three hours Bonus 4: Pokémon photobombing Go Snapshot Exclusive moves for evolution (Tyranitar): Smack Down (Fast rock-type attack) How useful is this Community Day Classic? Larvitar’s Community Day Classic event is not just great for shiny hunters or newcomers wanting to add a hard-to-find Pokémon to their Dex, but it’s also perfect for fans of battling. This is because Tyranitar - Larvitar’s final evolution - remains one of the best rock-type Pokémon in Pokémon Go. It’s a great choice for raids against Pokémon weak to rock-types and, if you’re a fan of the Go Battle League, then you’ve most likely fought a fair few Tyranitars in your time. This Community Day offers you the chance to catch a perfect IV Larvitar and collect enough candy to transform it into a Tyranitar which suits your purposes. The return of its Smack Down - its exclusive move - also gives you another option to play with when creating Tyranitar’s moveset. Remember, unlike high IV Pokémon, shinies don’t appear in the same place for everyone like high-IV Pokémon - there’s a random chance of each one you encounter could be a shiny. If you’re struggling, try ‘shiny checking’, by tapping a Pokémon, then backing out without catching, then moving on to the next. Second, there will be bonus Field Research. Community Days also have their own special Field Research tasks based on the specific Pokémon the day is highlighting. The rewards are usually just consumable items - Berries and the like - but it’s an additional thing to complete as you play. Third, every Community Day offers 3-Hour Lures. This is the perfect day to catch as many Pokémon as physically possible, and with the increased spawn rate, increase your chances of finding a shiny. The best way to take advantage of these bonuses is to find a set of PokéStops that are in quick walking distance or one another. You can then set up a Lure Module in one (or in multiple) and then walk between the PokéStops; taking advantage of the Lure and ensuring that you don’t run out of Poké Balls or Berries. It’s also an ideal time to experiment with either a Glacial Lure, Mossy Lure or Magnetic Lure Modules. These special lures attract a specific type of Pokémon depending on your chosen Lure. If you wanted to catch Water or Ice Pokémon, for example, then you would use a Glacial Lure Module. These specialised Lure Modules cost 200 PokéCoins from the in-game shop.. There are also specific bonuses for each Community Day, from reduced hatching distance to increased Stardust and XP. Even without the bonuses, remember Community Day is an opportunity to catch a lot of creatures in a short space of time, useful if you want to get through the backlog of Eggs in your roster, or put on a Lucky Egg or Star Piece to increase your gains from catches. Remember, if there is a deduced hatch rate, you only get bonus on Eggs you put into incubators during Community Day bonus hours. If you have an egg in an incubator before the event starts, it’s hatch distance still stay the same. Also, if you don’t hatch it before the event ends, it will stay that reduced distance until it does - so worth cramming one last one in before the event finishes! Also before the event itself, it may also be worth stockpiling Pinap Berries and Great or Ultra Balls. The Pinaps will increase your Candy gains - useful for evolving and powering up after the event ends - and you can really burn through Poké Balls over the course of the event. If you run out, then spin PokéStops or complete the newly added Field Research that appears. Finally, make sure you evolve the highlighted Pokémon to its third evolution to get an exclusive move. More of this in the following section… The Season of Mythical Wishes continues with the Winter Holiday event, which has brought Mega Glalie to Pokémon Go. Don’t forget to partake in the new Go Battle League season. Elsewhere, be sure to use Daily Adventure Incense for the chance of encountering Galarian Articuno, Galarian Zapdos and Galarian Moltres.\rNot only are these exclusive to these weekends, but they are more often than not the best move their third evolution can offer, and can propel them up the meta. You have two hours after the Community Day ends to evolve the Pokémon to get their move, so don’t worry about having to sort through your collection during the six hour window. If you miss out on evolving the Pokémon once Community Day weekend is over to get the exclusive move, don’t panic - you can use an Elite TM, or wait until December, where a special weekend will give you another chance to catch and evolve that previous year’s Community Day Pokémon. Pokémon Go Community Day exclusive moves list: The rules for earning this exclusive move are exactly the same too - you must reach the final evolution for the chosen Pokémon and said evolution must take place during the event or within the first two hours after it ends. These moves may not always be the best attack for this Pokémon, but, if want it and miss out on the event, you can always use an Elite TM on the final evolution to teach them the move.
