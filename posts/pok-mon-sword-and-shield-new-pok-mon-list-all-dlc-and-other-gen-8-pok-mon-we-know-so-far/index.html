On this page: Kubfu\nCategory: Wushu Pokémon Type: Fighting Height: 2’ Weight: 26.5 lbs Ability: Inner Focus\nKubfu is a new Legendary Pokémon. Description: “This Pokémon is hardworking and strives to train both its body and mind. It uses each defeat as motivation, training itself with even more vigor after a loss in order to grow stronger. It has an organ that produces “fighting energy” in its lower abdomen, and before heading into battle, Kubfu will increase this energy through unique breathing techniques and intense focus. Wild Kubfu live in mountainous areas far away from the Galar region, but it was once a species that called Galar its home. It’s noted in historical texts that this species used to head to uncharted lands with people as they set out to trade or explore. Records suggest that the Kubfu living in faraway mountains today may have descended from Kubfu that became naturalized to the distant lands they visited in their journeys.” Urshifu\nCategory: Wushu Pokémon Type: Single Strike Style - Fighting and dark-type / Rapid Strike Style - Fighting and water-type Height: 6'3\" Weight: 231.5 lbs Ability: Unseen Fist\nUrshifu is a new Legendary Pokémon and the evolution of Kubfu.

Urshifu in Single Strike Style form favor battling without holding anything back. When enraged, they will mercilessly attack an opponent until it is utterly defeated. A Single Strike Style Urshifu’s movements are often direct and involve rushing forward in a straight line. It will keep its distance from its opponents at first only to leap in close instantly to deliver a powerful blow. Urshifu in Rapid Strike Style form maintain a calm demeanor, observing their opponents and measuring their strength while dodging attacks. A Rapid Strike Style Urshifu will use flowing movements in battle to smoothly parry an opponent’s moves and then overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of rapid strikes.” Here the Gen 8 Pokémon that we know will be released alongside The Crown Tundra, the second part of the Pokémon Sword and Shield Expansion Pass.

Regidrago\nCategory: Dragon Orb Pokémon Type: Dragon-type Height: 6'11\" Weight: 440.9 lbs Ability: Dragon’s Maw\nRegidrago is the second member to be added to the Regi legendary family in The Crown Tundra DLC. Like the other members of the Regi family, it’s believed that Regidragon was created by Regigigas. Sadly, it’s believed that, when Regigigas was creating Regidragon, it ran out of crystallised dragon energy, which means that it was only able to construct the head of the dragon. This has lead to Regidragon being sealed inside it’s own temple, because people thought that, if it’s body was completed, it would begin to destroy Galar. Regidragon’s signature move is Dragon Energy, which becomes more powerful depending on how much HP the opponent has left.

If Sobble feels threatened, it will start to bawl and spread its tears around the area, causing everyone around it to start crying uncontrollably.

Ability: Strong Jaw / Shell Armor\nDescription: “The jagged fangs of the Bite Pokémon Drednaw are strong and sharp enough to bite through rock and iron. Though it has a heavy shell, its well-developed muscles allow it to move quickly. Drednaw is known to be extremely aggressive, so it takes a skilled Trainer to tame and handle this Pokémon.

Drednaw normally keeps its neck retracted within its shell, but when it attacks, it can rapidly shoot its neck out. Its jaws are also incredibly strong and can easily bite through huge metal towers. “The strength of its jaws combined with the force of its neck gives Drednaw the power to punch a hole through a rocky mountain in a single strike. Water-type moves used by Gigantamax Drednaw will change to G-Max Stonesurge. G-Max Stonesurge doesn’t just deal damage to an opponent-it will scatter sharp rocks around the opponent and cause Pokémon entering the battlefield to take damage.” Yamper\nCategory: Puppy Pokémon Type: Electric Height: 1′ Weight: 29.8 lbs.

It has an organ in its body that generates electricity, and it’s activated when Yamper runs around.

Ability: Flash Fire / White Smoke\nDescription: ‘When it heats up, its body temperature reaches about 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. It lashes its body like a whip and launches itself at enemies.

Rolycoly\nCategory: Coal Pokémon Type: Rock Height: 1′ Weight: 26.5 lbs.

In battle, Sirfetch’d uses the sharp stalk of its leek as a lance and the thick leaves as a shield. It maintains this leek over the span of many years and treasures it more than anything. When its leek finally withers, Sirfetch’d will leave the battlefield and retire from battling entirely. Meteor Assault is a new move introduced in these games that only Sirfetch’d can learn!

On this page:
Kubfu</p><p>Category: Wushu Pokémon Type: Fighting Height: 2&rsquo; Weight: 26.5 lbs Ability: Inner Focus</p><p>Kubfu is a new Legendary Pokémon.
Description: &ldquo;This Pokémon is hardworking and strives to train both its body and mind. It uses each defeat as motivation, training itself with even more vigor after a loss in order to grow stronger. It has an organ that produces &ldquo;fighting energy&rdquo; in its lower abdomen, and before heading into battle, Kubfu will increase this energy through unique breathing techniques and intense focus.
Wild Kubfu live in mountainous areas far away from the Galar region, but it was once a species that called Galar its home. It&rsquo;s noted in historical texts that this species used to head to uncharted lands with people as they set out to trade or explore. Records suggest that the Kubfu living in faraway mountains today may have descended from Kubfu that became naturalized to the distant lands they visited in their journeys.&rdquo;

Urshifu in Single Strike Style form favor battling without holding anything back. When enraged, they will mercilessly attack an opponent until it is utterly defeated. A Single Strike Style Urshifu&rsquo;s movements are often direct and involve rushing forward in a straight line. It will keep its distance from its opponents at first only to leap in close instantly to deliver a powerful blow.

A Rapid Strike Style Urshifu will use flowing movements in battle to smoothly parry an opponent&rsquo;s moves and then overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of rapid strikes.&rdquo;

Like the other members of the Regi family, it&rsquo;s believed that Regidragon was created by Regigigas. Sadly, it&rsquo;s believed that, when Regigigas was creating Regidragon, it ran out of crystallised dragon energy, which means that it was only able to construct the head of the dragon. This has lead to Regidragon being sealed inside it&rsquo;s own temple, because people thought that, if it&rsquo;s body was completed, it would begin to destroy Galar.
Regidragon&rsquo;s signature move is Dragon Energy, which becomes more powerful depending on how much HP the opponent has left.

They are calm and collected, and they make a point of always battling fairly. They are so noble in battle that they are often chosen as a motif for paintings. Of particular note is a painting-famous in the Galar region-that depicts a duel between a Sirfetch&rsquo;d and an Escavalier.
In battle, Sirfetch&rsquo;d uses the sharp stalk of its leek as a lance and the thick leaves as a shield. It maintains this leek over the span of many years and treasures it more than anything. When its leek finally withers, Sirfetch&rsquo;d will leave the battlefield and retire from battling entirely.
Meteor Assault is a new move introduced in these games that only Sirfetch&rsquo;d can learn! Sirfetch&rsquo;d points its leek at the opponent and charges toward them at great speed.
