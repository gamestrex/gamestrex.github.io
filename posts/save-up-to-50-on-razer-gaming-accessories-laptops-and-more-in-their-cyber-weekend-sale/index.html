Not only does this keyboard stand out thanks to its neon-green keycaps and RGB-backlighting, it also functions well too thanks to the intrinsic linear optical switches that’ll result in shorter response times from when you press the key to the on-screen output. It also has onboard memory, allowing you to swap between a total of 5 different profiles, each with their own distinct settings. Alternatively, there is the option of the Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed, which is listed as a best-seller in this sale, meaning it’s possibly one to look into if you’re not sure on the Tournament Edition or you’ve got a bit of extra cash to spare – this one is priced at £119.99, also a 40 per cent discount like the Huntsman.\rHowever, both of these keyboards are using a US layout which – if you’re from the UK – might not be the most appealing option. They are both vastly reduced though, so they’re both definitely worth keeping in mind!\nRazer Viper Ultimate Gaming Mouse In this lineup of options in Razer’s sale, they’re featuring two variants of the Digital Foundry-recommended Razer Viper Ultimate at a 34 and 35 per cent reduction respectively.\rAs Digital Foundry mentions, this mouse is a light wireless mouse and has a battery life of up to 70 hours, all whilst standing out beautifully with its RGB lighting. As DF also mentions, this mouse benefits from optical mouse switches that are good for “removing the need for a de-bounce delay and therefore speeding up clicks by a few milliseconds”.\rThe first of the two – the standard Razer Viper Ultimate – is available for £97.99, down from £149.99, whereas the second of the pair is priced a little higher at £103.99, but comes with a charging dock and the set is themed around CD Projekt Red’s Cyberpunk 2077.\nRazer Barracuda X Headset Everyone needs a good headset, particularly for competitive gaming, or even if you’re just wanting to talk with friends or experience a game in a more immersive setting – with that in mind, we’re pointing you towards the Razer Barracuda X that’s currently sat at a 35 per cent discount in Razer’s sale, priced at just £64.99.\rThere are additional colours available including black and quartz, but only the mercury colour is on sale in the UK – the rest will set you back £99.99 each, rather than the £35 discount available on the mercury set. In the US however, both black and quartz are on sale instead priced at $64.99 rather than the usual $99.99.\nRazer Barracude X in Mercury – £64.99 / $64.99 from Razer (was £99.99 / $99.99) Razer Barracude X in Black – £99.99 / $64.99 from Razer (was $99.99) Razer Barracude X in Quartz – £99.99 / $64.99 from Razer (was $99.99)\nAlternatively, you could join others with this 26 per cent discount on the best-selling Razer Kraken Kitty, netting yourself your own set of cat ear-headphones – you never know, it could be a new trend you might want to get onboard with…?\nRazer Kraken Kitty – £109.99 / $109.99 from Razer (was £149.99 / $149.99)\nRazer Iskur Gaming Chair Despite its final placement in this set of featured items from the Razer sale, a good chair is very important – particularly for gaming or any activity that involves sitting down for long periods of time. For this option, we’re going with Digital Foundry’s recommendation of the Razer Iskur, now available for £400.99, a 19 per cent reduction from its base price.\rIn their guide to the best gaming chairs, Digital Foundry recommends the Razer Iskur primarily as the best chair for back support, praising it for its transparency when adjusting your preferred support via its lumbar support – something they note is very useful should you share the chair with someone else.\rMuch like DF call out though, if you’re not in need of that support, you can appreciate what else this chair does well – such as its suitability for anyone who’s fairly tall due to its height, and it’s appealing black and green aesthetic, there’s always the option of the cheaper Razer Iskur X, available for £359.99.\nRazer Iskur Gaming Chair – £400.99 / $449.99 from Razer (was £499.99 / $499.99) Razer Iskur X Gaming Chair – £359.99 / $319.99 from Razer (was £399.99 / $399.99)\nRazer have much more on

For this option, we’re going with Digital Foundry’s recommendation of the Razer Iskur, now available for £400.99, a 19 per cent reduction from its base price.
In their guide to the best gaming chairs, Digital Foundry recommends the Razer Iskur primarily as the best chair for back support, praising it for its transparency when adjusting your preferred support via its lumbar support – something they note is very useful should you share the chair with someone else.
Much like DF call out though, if you’re not in need of that support, you can appreciate what else this chair does well – such as its suitability for anyone who’s fairly tall due to its height, and it&rsquo;s appealing black and green aesthetic, there&rsquo;s always the option of the cheaper Razer Iskur X, available for £359.99.</p><p>Razer Iskur Gaming Chair – £400.99 / $449.99 from Razer (was £499.99 / $499.99) Razer Iskur X Gaming Chair – £359.99 / $319.99 from Razer (was £399.99 / $399.99)</p><p>Razer have much more on offer though, including variations on some of the products and more – below we’ve listed some more of what they have on offer in the UK and US:</p><h3 id=gaming-laptops>Gaming Laptops<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gaming-laptops>#</a></h3><p>Razer Blade 14, Full HD 144Hz, GeForce RTX 3060 in Black – £1,964.99 / $1,849.99 from Razer (was £2,099.99 / $1,999.99) Razer Blade 14, Full HD 144Hz, GeForce RTX 3060 in Mercury – $1,849.99 from Razer (was $1,999.99) Razer Blade 15 Base Model, QHD 165Hz, GeForce RTX 3070 in Black – £1,916.99 / $2,049.99 from Razer (was £2,149.99 / $2,299.99)</p><h3 id=gaming-mice>Gaming Mice<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gaming-mice>#</a></h3><p>Razer Basilisk Ultimate (Mouse only) – £89.99 / $89.99 from Razer (was £149.99 / $149.99) Razer DeathAdder V2 – £45.99 / $45.99 from Razer (was £69.99 / $69.99) Razer DeathAdder V2 Pro in black – £84.99 / $84.99 from Razer (was £129.99 / $129.99) Razer Naga Trinity – £79.99 / $79.99 from Razer (was £99.99 / $99.99) Razer Naga Pro – £119.99 / $119.99 from Razer (was £149.99 / $149.99)</p><h3 id=gaming-keyboards>Gaming Keyboards<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gaming-keyboards>#</a></h3><p>Razer BlackWidow V3 Tenkeyless, w/ Green Switch and UK Layout – £69.99 / $69.99 from Razer (was £99.99 / $99.99) Razer BlackWidow V3 Pro w/ Green Switch and UK Layout – £149.99 / $149.99 from Razer (was £229.99 / $229.99)</p><h3 id=gaming-headsets>Gaming Headsets<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gaming-headsets>#</a></h3><p>Razer Opus X in Green – £69.99 / $69.99 from Razer (was £99.99 / $99.99) Razer Opus in Black – $119.99 from Razer (was $199.99) Razer Kraken Ultimate – $77.99 from Razer (was $129.99)</p><h3 id=headsets-and-controllers-for-console-and-mobile>Headsets and Controllers for Console and Mobile<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#headsets-and-controllers-for-console-and-mobile>#</a></h3><p>Razer Kaira Pro for PlayStation – £129.99 / $129.99 from Razer (was £199.99 / $199.99) Razer Kaira Pro for Xbox in Black – £89.99 from Razer (was £149.99) Razer Kaira Pro for Xbox in White – $89.99 from Razer (was $149.99) Razer Wolverine V2 Controller for Xbox Series X in Black – £59.99 / $59.99 from Razer (was £99.99 / $99.99) Razer Wolverine V2 Chroma Controller for Xbox Series X|S in Black – £99.99 from Razer (was £149.99) Razer Wolverine V2 Chroma Controller for Xbox Series X|S in White – $99.99 from Razer (was $149.99) Razer Kishi Controller for Android (Xbox) – £44.99 / $44.99 from Razer (was £99.99 / $99.99) Razer Raiju Mobile – $74.99 from Razer (was $149.99)</p><p>Be sure to head on over to our main deals hub for Black Friday 2022 deals, as well as give us a follow on our Jelly Deals Twitter where we&rsquo;ll be sharing all the best deals we find as they go live throughout the Black Friday week!</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/razer-blade-14-mercury-02.png/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/razer-blade-14-mercury-02.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Save up to 50  on Razer gaming accessories  laptops and more in their Cyber Weekend sale -
