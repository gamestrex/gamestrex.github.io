With Land Forme Shaymin’s initial release being part of Go Fest 2022, unlocking this questline requires you to have purchased a ticket for the event. Land Forme Shaymin will, however, most likely be made available to every Pokémon Go player via a new special research quest in a similar manner to past mythical Pokémon, like Meloetta, Victini and Celebi. Additionally, the ‘Rhi’s Arrival’ special research is available to everyone during Go Fest 2022 Day 2, and ‘A Radiant World’ for ticket-holders who complete the Rhi’s Arrival quest during the second day of the special event. On this page: Pokémon Go Fest 2022 special research quest: Other quest details: Pokémon Go Fest 2022 is the first quest in Pokémon Go where you have to select a difficulty level - Relaxed, Standard and Master. Your selection will have an effect on some of the challenges you receive and determine which sticker you receive from Pokémon Go Fest 2022, but not the other rewards you earn. You’ll also be given the choice between three paths - Battle, Catch and Explore - with your selection determining the challenges and rewards you receive from this quest. Below you’ll find the first set of challenges and rewards for the Pokémon Go Fest 2022 special research quest and, afterwards, we outline each individual path in their own dedicated section.

Each of these choices focuses on a different set of activities in Pokémon Go, which you can find below:\nBattle - Raids, battling Team Go Rocket, purifying Shadow Pokémon and battling in the Go Battle League Catch - Catching different species of Pokémon and conducting different types of throws Explore - Hatching eggs, completing field research tasks, walking specific distances and activities with your buddy Pokémon\nWhile the majority of the rewards you receive remain the same, some differ depending on which step you pick. The Explore Path, for example, will reward you with incubators, while the Battle Path has a selection of TMs and more Premium Battle Passes as rewards. When it comes to choosing the best path for you, we recommend thinking about which activities you prefer in Pokémon and which rewards you like best. Personally I’ll be picking the Explore Path, because I enjoy playing Pokémon Go on long walks and really need those extra incubators for 12km eggs. The second choice you make occurs after completing Step 2 and asks you to choose the difficulty level for the rest of the quest - Relaxed, Standard and Master. It’s important to note that this choice only changes the stickers you’ll earn from completing the quest and a number of challenges, but not the overall rewards. For this reason, we recommend looking at the different challenges you’ll face for each difficulty level listed above before making this decision and consider how long it will take you to complete these challenges. If you want to complete this quest quickly, for example, then choose Relaxed. Yet, if you’re looking for a longer challenge, then Master is the way to go. The Season of Mythical Wishes continues with the Winter Holiday event, which has brought Mega Glalie to Pokémon Go. Don’t forget to partake in the new Go Battle League season. Elsewhere, be sure to use Daily Adventure Incense for the chance of encountering Galarian Articuno, Galarian Zapdos and Galarian Moltres.\rAt the time of writing, there is no way to transform Shaymin into its Sky Forme in Pokémon Go. To unlock this questline you must log into Pokémon Go on either Saturday, 4th June or Sunday, 5th June between 10am to 6pm (local time), which is when the event is live. Doing so will automatically unlock this special research quest and, since it has no deadline, you can complete it at your own pace. If you don’t purchase a Go Fest 2022 ticket, you won’t be able to access this research quest. Like all research quests, Pokémon Go Fest 2022 is divided into a series of quest steps and each one has a number of challenges. Completing these tasks will not only unlock rewards, but allow you to progress through the questline. Pokémon Go Fest 2022 is also a branching quest and, therefore, offers you a selection of paths that all have different challenges and rewards. What makes Pokémon Go Fest 2022 different compared to all the special research quests which have come before it - branching or not - is its difficulty setting. You must choose between Relaxed, Standard and Master - with Relaxed being the easiest and Master the hardest. Aside from affecting the difficulty level of the challenges you receive from Pokémon Go Fest 2022, this choice will also determine which sticker you receive from the quest. The other rewards, however, will not be affected.

You also have to select which difficulty level you wish the quest to be and, for both of these reasons, it’s a good idea to know which Choose Path choice is best for you.
With Land Forme Shaymin’s initial release being part of Go Fest 2022, unlocking this questline requires you to have purchased a ticket for the event. Land Forme Shaymin will, however, most likely be made available to every Pokémon Go player via a new special research quest in a similar manner to past mythical Pokémon, like Meloetta, Victini and Celebi.
Additionally, the &lsquo;Rhi&rsquo;s Arrival&rsquo; special research is available to everyone during Go Fest 2022 Day 2, and &lsquo;A Radiant World&rsquo; for ticket-holders who complete the Rhi&rsquo;s Arrival quest during the second day of the special event.

Pokémon Go Fest 2022 special research quest:
Other quest details:
Pokémon Go Fest 2022 is the first quest in Pokémon Go where you have to select a difficulty level - Relaxed, Standard and Master. Your selection will have an effect on some of the challenges you receive and determine which sticker you receive from Pokémon Go Fest 2022, but not the other rewards you earn.
You’ll also be given the choice between three paths - Battle, Catch and Explore - with your selection determining the challenges and rewards you receive from this quest.
Below you’ll find the first set of challenges and rewards for the Pokémon Go Fest 2022 special research quest and, afterwards, we outline each individual path in their own dedicated section. Be prepared for spoilers though!

The first occurs after completing Step 1 and offers you the choice between Battle, Catch and Explore. Each of these choices focuses on a different set of activities in Pokémon Go, which you can find below:</p><p>Battle - Raids, battling Team Go Rocket, purifying Shadow Pokémon and battling in the Go Battle League Catch - Catching different species of Pokémon and conducting different types of throws Explore - Hatching eggs, completing field research tasks, walking specific distances and activities with your buddy Pokémon</p><p>While the majority of the rewards you receive remain the same, some differ depending on which step you pick. The Explore Path, for example, will reward you with incubators, while the Battle Path has a selection of TMs and more Premium Battle Passes as rewards.
When it comes to choosing the best path for you, we recommend thinking about which activities you prefer in Pokémon and which rewards you like best.
Personally I’ll be picking the Explore Path, because I enjoy playing Pokémon Go on long walks and really need those extra incubators for 12km eggs.
The second choice you make occurs after completing Step 2 and asks you to choose the difficulty level for the rest of the quest - Relaxed, Standard and Master.
It’s important to note that this choice only changes the stickers you’ll earn from completing the quest and a number of challenges, but not the overall rewards.
For this reason, we recommend looking at the different challenges you’ll face for each difficulty level listed above before making this decision and consider how long it will take you to complete these challenges.
If you want to complete this quest quickly, for example, then choose Relaxed. Yet, if you’re looking for a longer challenge, then Master is the way to go.
The Season of Mythical Wishes continues with the Winter Holiday event, which has brought Mega Glalie to Pokémon Go. Don&rsquo;t forget to partake in the new Go Battle League season.
Elsewhere, be sure to use Daily Adventure Incense for the chance of encountering Galarian Articuno, Galarian Zapdos and Galarian Moltres.<br>At the time of writing, there is no way to transform Shaymin into its Sky Forme in Pokémon Go.
To unlock this questline you must log into Pokémon Go on either Saturday, 4th June or Sunday, 5th June between 10am to 6pm (local time), which is when the event is live. Doing so will automatically unlock this special research quest and, since it has no deadline, you can complete it at your own pace.
If you don’t purchase a Go Fest 2022 ticket, you won’t be able to access this research quest.
Like all research quests, Pokémon Go Fest 2022 is divided into a series of quest steps and each one has a number of challenges. Completing these tasks will not only unlock rewards, but allow you to progress through the questline.
Pokémon Go Fest 2022 is also a branching quest and, therefore, offers you a selection of paths that all have different challenges and rewards. What makes Pokémon Go Fest 2022 different compared to all the special research quests which have come before it - branching or not - is its difficulty setting.
You must choose between Relaxed, Standard and Master - with Relaxed being the easiest and Master the hardest. Aside from affecting the difficulty level of the challenges you receive from Pokémon Go Fest 2022, this choice will also determine which sticker you receive from the quest. The other rewards, however, will not be affected.
