The New Operation Pass CSGO Operation Riptide introduces the new Operation Pass which is the one thing needed to take part in this new update. On purchasing the operation pass, you can earn Stars by completing weekly missions. Those stars allow you to buy rewards from the Operation Shop!\nMission Coins When completing weekly missions, you can earn stars. The more stars you earn you get different coins for that. Starting with the Bronze coin on buying the Operation Pass, you can upgrade your Coin. You can display these coins on your CSGO Profile.\nOn Reaching 33 Stars you can upgrade from a Bronze to a Silver. When you get 66 Stars you can upgrade from Silver to Gold. On getting 100 Stars, you reach Diamond Coin.\nBrand new Private Queue This new feature allows you to create a private queue for all your friends. Simply generate a code and send it to your friends. You can play solo or teams on a private queue. If you have a steam group, you can directly invite your whole steam group to a private queue.\nAll the New Game Modes in CSGO Operation Riptide Along with the new Private queue, there are major updates in some of the game modes. Competitive Matchmaking now has a Short mode. There will be 16 match rounds in short mode and 30 in long mode. You can also choose to have no preference. New Deathmatch modes have been added which are Team Deathmatch and Free-for-all Deathmatch. You can now play in teams and the first team to get 100 kills wins. Free for all is where all players are your enemies. Updates have been made to Demolition mode and Arms Race.\nOperation Shop – What is it? When you earn stars after completing challenges, you can redeem those stars in exchange for rewards in the Operation Shop. There are plenty of skins, patches, stickers, and even the Operation Case you can purchase. Note: The shop only unlocks for you if you have purchased the Operation Pass. Without the Pass, you are unable to earn stars and redeem them. You may still complete weekly missions without the pass.\nOperation Riptide Weekly Missions in CSGO There are 16 weekly missions in total which is the whole Operation. Each week new missions are unlocked. You can check the status of the missions and look at the checklist on the main Operation Missions page. The first Week Mission gives you 10 Stars on completion. The rest of the missions will give you 6 stars per week just like the previous Operations in CSGO. You may complete the missions first and then purchase the Operation Pass before the end of 16 weeks.\nCSGO Weapon Buffs and Weapon Nerfs The Deagle body damage has been reduced in this update. Deagle is a very commonly used weapon and this nerf is truly going to make things more competitive. The M4A1-S has been buffed to increase body damage. The cost of the Dual Elites has been reduced. So there are great chances of seeing a lot of this around. Grenades are now just like any other weapon and can be dropped.\nNew Maps in Operation Riptide CSGO 5 new maps have been added to this update. These maps have been removed from the official Matchmaking Updates have also been made to some of the favorite existing maps like Dust2, Inferno, and Ancient. Things are looking very competitive and this should make or break your gameplay.\nNew Agents \u0026 Skins in Operation Riptide in Counter-Strike There are a lot of new agents that have been added. Agents like Guerrilla Warfare Terrorists, Frog Men CT, French Gendarmerie are all of the new skins and agents we’re going to see after this new update. There are 4 new collections of skins that have also been released in this update. They are,\nThe Train Collection Mirage Collection Dust 2 Collection Vertigo Collection\nTo view all the weapon skins, click here to check the official CS:GO website!\nHow to buy Operation Pass for Operation Riptide in CSGO You can buy the Operation Pass from Steam for 1,140 INR or $14.99. Simply go on the Counter Strike Global Offensive Store page on steam and purchase it from there. You can also click on Buy Operation Pass in the game. Operation Pass is also tradeable. So if you have a friend that wants to buy the pass for you or if you want to buy it for someone else, you can simply trade them on steam. This was everything in the new CSGO Operation Riptide Update!
