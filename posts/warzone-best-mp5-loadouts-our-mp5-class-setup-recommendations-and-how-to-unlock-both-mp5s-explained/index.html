The MP5 is great at close quarters while you’re storming buildings and all sorts of facilities. The Modern Warfare variant has lost popularity over time, as developer Raven continues to move on from the weapons of said game and focus on Black Ops: Cold War instead. That being said, there are people who still use it, so we’ll be offering a loadout for both. This page will cover how to unlock the MP5 in both of its variants, and the best MP5 loadouts and MP5 class recommendations to make the most out each weapon’s potential. On this page: For more explainers, read our selection of best Warzone weapon recommendations, as well as deep dives into popular picks such as the CARV.2, FARA 83, Stoner 63, AK-47, Bullfrog and PPSh-41. One of these variants originates from Black Ops Cold War, while the other version is native to Warzone. Both weapons used to function the same at first, but the many tweaks and balances since its launch have led us to prioritize the Cold War variant, which is the one we recommend using. The version that’s native to the battle royale game, and has been there from day one, unlocks at the incredibly low level of 4, meaning you’ll unlock the standard version of the MP5 in no time at all. The Black Ops Cold War version of the MP5, which was only just added to Warzone in early December 2020, unlocks at the slightly higher level of 12, which is the weapon’s unlock level in Treyarch’s game. Remember that you don’t need to own a copy of Black Ops Cold War in order to get access to the game-specific variant of the weapon in Call of Duty: Warzone. So no matter which Call of Duty games you own, you’ll be able to unlock two versions of the MP5 in very short order.\nBarrel: Monolithic Integral Suppressor (Unlocks at level 36) Stock: FTAC Collapsible (Unlocks at level 51) Underbarrel: Merc Foregrip (Unlocks at level 19) Ammunition: 45 Round Mags (Unlocks at level 13) Perk: Sleight of Hand (Unlocks at level 37)\nLet’s start with the barrel. For this we picked the Monolithic Integral Suppressor, which increases bullet velocity as well as adding sound suppression, of course. It trades off a slight reduce to aim down sight speed, but not by much. The FTAC Collapsible is great for this build, as it increases both movement and ADS speed, which tend to be the target for cons in the attachments we’ve chosen. It affects recoil and aiming stability, but not by much. As for the underbarrel, we went for the Merc Foregrip, which increases both recoil control and hip fire accuracy. As a trade-off, your ADS and aim walking movement speed will be reduced. In terms of ammunition, we highly recommend increasing the one in the Modern Warfare MP5. For this, the 45 Round Mags attachment will do the job just fine, although it comes with a cost to ADS and movement speed. Lastly, opting for Sleight of Hand is the best choice for the weapon’s perk, as it will increase your reload speed when using it.\nPerk 1: Quick Fix (Unlocks at level 42) Perk 2: Overkill (Unlocks at level 38) Perk 3: Amped (Unlocks at level 1) Secondary: C58 (Unlocks by reaching tier 31 of the battle pass - including the free version) Tactical: Stun Grenade (Unlocks at level 1) Lethal: Frag Grenade (Unlocks at level 1)\nBy using this MP5 build it won’t take you long to start taking down enemies, which is why beginning health regeneration immediately after each battle with Quick Fix makes for a great combo. As per usual, if level 42 sounds a bit steep, we recommend opting for E.O.D., as it will help to mitigate damage from non-killstreak explosives and fire until you can unlock this perk. As per usual we recommend opting for Overkill as the second perk. As for our weapon of choice, the C58 is the perfect pair. This assault rifle is great at long distances and has a daunting fire power. If a target manages to sneak past your C58 fray, don’t fret, as Amped will increase the speed of the switching over to the MP5. As for equipment, we opted to use the Heartbeat Sensor ourselves. If you lose sight of a target or just want to double check the perimeter before going inside a building, a quick look at the sensor is a great strategy. Lastly, we can’t recommend the Proximity Mine enough; it’s quick to deploy and will always cover your back, especially if you place it at the side of entrances or stairs. Stray frag grenades only cause noise in the distance, but even if the mine fails, it will still serve as an alarm of enemies approaching your location.\nMuzzle: Agency Suppressor (Unlocks at level 46) Laser: Tiger Team Spotlight (Unlocks at level 40) Stock: Raider Stock (Unlocks at level 54) Underbarrel: Bruiser Grip (Unlocks at level 33) Ammunition: STANAG 50 Rnd Drum (Unlocks at level 34)\nLet’s start with the muzzle. For this we picked the Agency Suppressor, which increases bullet velocity, vertical recoil control and effective damage range, as well as adding sound suppression, of course. It trades these off with a hit to aim down sight speed, aim walking steadiness and aiming stability, but all of these are balanced out in the overall build. The Tiger Team Spotlight is a great laser for this build, improving both movement and aim walking movement speed, complimenting the cons of the muzzle. It comes with a hit to aiming stability, but not by much. As for the stock, we went for the Raider Stock to improve sprint to fire time and both ADS firing move and aim walking movement speed. Hip fire accuracy is hit by this, but since you’ll be using ADS most of the time and the cost isn’t that huge either, it’s balanced out. While we used to recommend a Rear Grip before, opting for the Bruiser Grip underbarrel attachment is the best choice for this build at the moment. This will improve both movement speed and aiming stability. In terms of ammunition, we highly recommend increasing the one in the Cold War MP5. For this, the STANAG 50 Rnd Drum attachment will do the job just fine, although it comes with a cost to ADS speed and reload quickness. Warzone Season 5 is almost here!\rIf you want to learn more about firepower from previously, we explain the best Welgun loadout, best Cooper Carbine loadout, best Gorenko Anti-Tank Rifle loadout, best STG44 loadout, best MP40 loadout, best Automaton loadout, best BAR loadout, best Combat Shotgun loadout, best Type 100 loadout, and best Kar98k loadouts.\nPerk 1: Quick Fix (Unlocks at level 42) Perk 2: Overkill (Unlocks at level 38) Perk 3: Amped (Unlocks at level 1) Secondary: Swiss K31 (Unlocks by getting 2 Headshot kills in 15 different completed matches using any sniper rifle) Tactical: Stun Grenade (Unlocks at level 1) Lethal: Frag Grenade (Unlocks at level 1)\nWith this Cold War MP5 build it won’t take you long to start taking down enemies, which is why beginning health regeneration immediately after each battle with Quick Fix makes for a great combo. If level 42 sounds a bit steep, we recommend opting for E.O.D., as it will help to mitigate damage from non-killstreak explosives and fire until you can unlock this perk. As per usual we recommend opting for Overkill as the second perk. As for our weapon of choice, the Swiss K31 is the perfect pair. This sniper rifle is fast and can deal damage at great distances in just a few seconds. If a target manages to sneak past your sniper, don’t fret, as Amped will increase the speed of the action. Rounding out the equipment, we’re going for rather traditional choices here, with a Stun Grenade and Frag Grenade for each. The SMG isn’t exactly suited for long distances, so throwing explosives or stunning enemies before you storm in with an attack is a strategy you should consider.\n","wordCount":"1371","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-28T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-28T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michael Gentile"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/warzone-best-mp5-loadouts-our-mp5-class-setup-recommendations-and-how-to-unlock-both-mp5s-explained/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Warzone Best Mp5 Loadouts Our Mp5 Class Setup Recommendations And How To Unlock Both Mp5S Explained</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-28 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 28, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1371 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Michael Gentile</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>Warzone&rsquo;s Verdansk map is obviously massive, which you&rsquo;ll no doubt know by now if you&rsquo;ve spent any time roaming the vast Ukraine-based whereabouts.
