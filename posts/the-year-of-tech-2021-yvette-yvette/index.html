If you’ve been trying to buy one of the most popular gaming gadgets this year, you may know one more word: semiconductor shortage. Out of the world supply chain problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, supply of components needed for high-end electronics has been limited, leading to manufacturing delays and consumer products failure. The ripples of the deficit are felt in everything from the rising inflation to Final Fantasy XIV server queues, but PC graphics cards and PS5 and Xbox X are hit especially hard and it means they cannot find high-ticket items at their advertised prices. Unfortunately, no end has been announced, as many industry leaders have said that the chip shortage will extend through 2022 and, most likely, in 2023. Loading\nNinth-Generation Consoles: One Year later, they were created. Since the launch of the Xbox-Series X and NES in a year, Microsoft and Sony began a new generation of gaming consoles, but they remain some of the most desirable and difficult-to-find gadgets today. The deterioration of chip supplies also kept stock short, and when they are not able to store the digital store shelves, they’re quickly snatched by bots and the big markup can be resold. With a low price, both consoles have sold in their first year but their futures look promising. For those who managed to sell a console, we have seen steady improvements in hardware and software throughout the year. One of the biggest problems both consoles had to have in the past was the minimal storage space, particularly for the PS5, which has just 667 GB of usable space and runs without the opportunity to expand it. Last summer, Sony finally released a firmware update that allows owners of the PS5 to open up their consoles and install their own M.2 SSD to expand the storage space. Even though it seems intimidating for some, the process’s quite straightforward, there are many SSDs available. Throughout the Microsoft side, the major options to replace the proprietary storage expansion card have given the Xbox X users more possibilities to play with a growing library of games installs. Loading Support from the river continues to grow. The Xbox Design Lab returned, giving gamers personalized Xbox controllers, and personalized colors, rubber grips and metallic finish on the triggers and d-pad. The PS5 got even some personality this year, with the release of several new DualSense and console faceplates. With an official support from the PlayStation 5, the PS5 has finally gotten to the Xbox Elite, thanks to third-party controller maker Scuf, that announced the Reflex Pro, a compassable controller with flip-flops, an interchangeable thumbstick and a customizable color palette. That’s welcome addition to the controller landscape. We hope more companies will follow suit in 2022.\nThe Revival of Gaming Handhelds! The game-hit Nintendo Switch made sure that handheld gaming never truly died, but recently, a handful of newcomers came into the fold with each other having its own different approach to gaming off the screen. The most notable is the Valve Steam Deck, a handheld gaming PC that will run SteamOS. When it comes to it is promised that it will let gamers to play game libraries on the go or onto the couch. Steam deck was announced with the date for the holiday season, but that same chip shortage made it late 2022. Analogue Pocket – Gameplay Images10 IMAGES – Games. While Steam Deck wasn’t the only handheld of the year, it wasn’t exciting. The long-awaited Analogue Pocket is a handheld that plays Game Boy cartridges without having to emulation and finally launched its first wave of units in December. More is going, but because of the chip shortage again, they’re now 20 more expensive and will be shipping in waves with first-come first-served and second-served firsts in 2022, followed by late 2022. Finally, we have the Playdate, an attractive handheld you can recharge with a crank on the side of the door. Several experiments are done or not, but it is produced from notable indie developers. It was supposed to go out this year, but it also was pushing into 2022. No matter the date or their particular approaches, these new devices continue to develop, and use the switch with its unique OLED model, to help the handheld gaming environment.\nCloud gaming puts tremendous effort into the world. Cloud gaming is nothing new, but in 2021 saw this new technology make big progress. In October, Nvidia announced a new subscription tier for its GeForce Now platform that allows you to rent a PC with an RTX 3080. While the cloud game still has its own share of hiccups, access to this level of power is welcome considering the difficulties with which it was hard to buy a RTX 30-series graphics card in real life. Loading In terms of Microsoft, the game will continue to hit its full potential with Xbox Cloud Gaming. It was launched last year on Android devices, but was later introduced to Apple devices, the Xbox PC and the Xbox console. That increasing device support means that many people have a free way to try the service out and experience a game without the need for local gaming hardware to buy. It also means that new-gen exclusives like Starfield will be played on Xbox One or your phone. One more thing is, cloud gaming is not without its quirks namely, it depends on the quality of your internet connection. The medium has a long time to go before it could fully supplant console or PC hardware in most gamers living rooms if we ever do it before it is as effective as ever. Although support and progress on both devices and platforms show a clear progress towards the end of the gaming year, cloud gaming will continue to be an important piece of the gaming landscape in the next year.\n","wordCount":"981","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-08T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-08T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Larissa Gaunce"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/the-year-of-tech-2021-yvette-yvette/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>The Year Of Tech 2021 Yvette Yvette</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-08 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 8, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;981 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Larissa Gaunce</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#the-chips-arent-available-yet>The Chips aren’t available yet.</a></li><li><a href=#ninth-generation-consoles-one-year-later-they-were-created>Ninth-Generation Consoles: One Year later, they were created.</a></li><li><a href=#the-revival-of-gaming-handhelds>The Revival of Gaming Handhelds!</a></li><li><a href=#cloud-gaming-puts-tremendous-effort-into-the-world>Cloud gaming puts tremendous effort into the world.</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h2 id=the-chips-arent-available-yet>The Chips aren’t available yet.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-chips-arent-available-yet>#</a></h2><p>If you’ve been trying to buy one of the most popular gaming gadgets this year, you may know one more word: semiconductor shortage.
