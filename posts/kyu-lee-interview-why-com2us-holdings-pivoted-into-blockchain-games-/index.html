I have hoped for partners and invested in Animoca, Sandbox, Upland and Mythical Games. They changed its name to Com2Us Holdings and Gamevil. That company is going to be pivoting in a major way through free-to-play games that have brought great prosperity and partnerships with brands like the NBA. The entire family is entering NFT and other blockchain technologies. You’ll always be aware of that, especially if you take these types of things like it, and focus on them, in the same way that it focused many years ago on playing free games. It makes Com2Us one of the biggest mobile game companies to move into NFT. Since it was founded in 1998 and has a son in South Korea, Com2uS became a subsidiary of mobile game developer Gamevil in 2013 (and now the whole company is Com2Us Holdings). Com2Us Summoners War has more than 100 million downloads and sales worth $2 billion. The upcoming Com2U games are Chromatic Soul: AFK, Kritika: the White Knights, Project MR, and Summoners War: Chronicles. Baseball Superstars, World of Zenonia and The Great Merchant will also be available soon. I caught up with Lee about this pivot, and gave him an edited transcript of the interview. Above: Kyu Lee is the president of Com2Us. Image Credit: Com2Us. GamesBeat: It looks a huge point for Gamevil and Com2U. Could you discuss the context and the underlying question? Kyu Lee: In 2020, we started investing in Coinone. Coinone is the third largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea. We always longed in the blockchain space, but there weren’t any action items available, so the whole thing to do. We knew there was a lot of traction there. We knew that we should learn a little more about it. We decided to invest in an exchange. It would be the best way to start learning. The NBA’s top shot became apparent again. In some way, since we also involved in the sports collectible market, we have four games with Major League Baseball, and one game with the NBA, we were trying to figure out NFTs. We thought it would become a mass market. The NBA was the first place to be in this list. When we saw the numbers coming from Axie Infinity, we played a game. We saw that there is a lot of opportunity. There are so many hurdles in the game that it was unbelievable, but it was also unbelievable that it was generating a lot of money and so many people were playing. That’s what got us here. We began talking to the internal production team to make this thing real. We started by thinking about the games. Our manager, Yong Kuk Lee, really likes it. He was always thinking about the metamorphic stuff. Between them, we acquired a company called Wysiwyg studio. Wysiwyg Studios is a South Korean company publicly listed. They’re originally a VFX studio. They have done lots of things in the metaverse preparation field, so to speak. However, when we bought them, we did it because we thought that Netflix was the new app store for all of the television producers in Korea. South Korea has some great talent, but they did not let them distribute their content through local broadcast channels. With Netflix, there’s more room for theres a big company called Studio Dragon, which sells some great deals of content from Netflix. We thought we had more money left to do, so we thought we should acquire Wysiwyg and roll up a lot of TV production studios under it. Is there anything the entertainment business, the webtoons and the IP creation they did? They always wanted to partner with a gaming company and we always wanted to expand our IP. We do that on our partnership with Skybound, but how could we do more? The vision we had was amazing. All of these things were pointed in a direction which we had to go. We had to do a metaverse. We must play on the blockchain. We’ve got to do NFTs. That’s how we ended up investing in Candy.com. Candy.com has exclusive rights for Major League Baseball NFTs. We went in with Insight and Softbank. We invested ten million dollars in this area. Above: Com2Us Holdings is moving into blockchain games. Image Credit: Com2Us. Our company took the turn of their production, looking for the right blockchain and the right partners, but we found that money could move faster. We started talking to all the top players in the blockchain gaming field. We ended up using the following materials: Animoca, Sandbox, Upland and Mythical Games. Those were the four investment we made, too. All these were really late-stage, already established companies, but to get our feet back in and understand what’s happening, establish a relationship within the ecosystem and promote that we are not just a gaming company, but we want to become a gaming company, too. I think it worked very well. After we began doing those investments, many of these rounds were oversubscribed, but I think everyone felt happy to have a gaming company. We were not the world’s largest gaming company, but a new gaming company got on their cap table. We were very happy at our entrance into the space. We have to put up a new budget. We were very happy about it. I’ve gotten closer to investing in the majority of companies. We want to live like the anime team. That looks pretty cool. Our approach in ourselves thought about a lot of different chains. There are so many fasmos and solutions that we could have adopted. I like what Solana is doing and how they build up an ecosystem that will be awesome to run games, due to the speed and all that. However, we decided to work with Terra. Terra is a South Korean company, an established crypto company. This means they have an amazing ecosystem. I was very shocked they weren’t as well-known in the West. They have always gained traction in the past few months, but they have still been very popular. When you do only a simple game or a DeFi, it doesn’t gain much traction among the app developers or the entertainment space, where we’re located. After they announced their smart contracts, I think that lots of projects are being built on Terra. It is difficult for our development team to swallow the sack of hundreds of pages of documents. It’s amazing having a South Korean team Do Kwan, the CEO. His team was perfect for us. We’re extremely happy about our relationship to Terra. We’re building an NFT platform with a big name of K-pop and all the entertainment companies we have. It’ll also have fun. We’ll also use them as our blockchain partner. We’re building wallets together and all that else should be done to support our games. Above: Com2Us is working on multiple blockchain games. Co-op Image: Com2Us. GamesBeat: You look like a full-pocket pivot. Do you still plan to do mobile games, non-no-nft and non-blockchain? Lee: There are many restrictions about how we can support our games and how we can stand them. The most interesting thing I learned, though, is that once you get to this side of the world, the other side would look stale and boring. The world’s been going on forever since I was telling friends. I’m the one who talks about this thing on every level, like myself. It sounds like a new way of getting mobile. A happy moment to get all you can. Make sure youre always on the beat. It is very rewarding. We have numerous products which will launch as planned. Hopefully a lot of our producer heads will become more open-minded about moving over. They are launching games later on. They probably needed something new such a thing. GamesBeat: The developers themselves want to try this one. Lee: “Yes.” This is enough to give you a lot of time. I first noticed that a time when the App Store arrived in the first place, I thought, Oh, lets have a virtual currency running across all of the games. Let’s make a market where users can buy and sell. We got this idea. By following the rules, we uncovered a definite way of thinking. With all these technologies helping game developers, you realize, Oh, I forgot we were able to do that. We have met many of those moments. It’s another great tool for game developers to express themselves. If you want to use this tool, we’d encourage that. Evidently, there are some games which are much better worked in the web2 world. But there will be many new kinds of games that will be well seen in the web3. GamesBeat: Is there a certain percentage of the company that is dedicated to working on this, or is it basically everyone working on it? Lee: At the moment it everyone is. The order has been delivered by top company. Each student gets through the learning curve. We started out having a small team, but now there are a lot of different projects involved so it doesn’t make any secret. It’s not just one or two projects. We already announced about 10 new projects. We pivoted a lot of games which we were planning on opening this year or early next year, and put them back together so they are playing a play-to-earn or NFT aspect. If you remember the moment we first made purchases on the App Store, I don’t think every game suddenly went over to free-to-play, followed by the true spirit of free-to-play. There were very little efforts to adopt animals. I think I’m going through that same process pretty much completely. There isn’t anything on offer. What a good one. The best games I think were in a lot of fail, but at least from a gaming perspective. All the games I’ve had so far, they’re good, but very good production quality. A lot of the games that were releasing are, even in the next year, in development. Above: Com2Us began in 1998 and merged with Gamevil in 2013. Copyright: MCVA. GamesBeat: Did you see Ubisoft announcement in Ghost Recon Breakpoint? I saw that link. The tiniest of steps is GamesBeat. I think this is meant to educate the market and gain acceptance from people. This is a very strict control to people who play the Ghost Recon so many times. And even those who buy to the secondary market should have played the game, too. They don’t sell the non-profits. They are making you even better when they’re taking this step. Why people are negative, they are angry about the stunt. Lee: There’s going to be lots of baby steps. But these games will look much better. Many new projects are launching from the beginning, so they’ll probably try to find out how they can use that technology as much as they can. And those games are taking another two, three, four, or many years. Who knows? There are plenty of new trends. Right now we saw Axie Infinity. Everybody thinks in that mentality. In South Korea wrangle was Mir 4, made by Wemade. That game was totally opposite. They switched a free-to-play game and just added some play-to-play aspects. Now suddenly people realize you can do that. Those new kinds of economics will be a big factor, although we don’t work on the production team. That’s my experience. Gamesbeat: Have you seen any resistance of gamers? I know that Ubisoft does know that some of them are now happening. It seems like the hardcore players are associated with things like loot boxes and scams, and aggressive monetization. Lee: We haven’t seen much from our users yet. I’ve seen it at other games. Even Cookie Run announced they would do Cookie Run NFTs and they faced huge backlash. Well have to see. The same thing happened when everyone switched to play free and using loot boxes. It will require much education. I think we’re filling in a gap and will provide a lot more value to our users at the same time. Even Crypto itself has many negative associations around it, no matter how big or large it is and when it comes to environmental impact or money laundering, it has itself. It’s a very powerful tool, but it’s not only a huge instrument. We just need to try to use that kind of thing. Above: Kate, the White Knights will come in Q1 2022. Image credit: Com2Us. GamesBeat: How soon will any of these things arrive? How are you planning on 2022? Lee: I don’t know what I’ll get on first. Our schedules always change. In fact, most of the games will come around the middle of the next year. GamesBeat: Anything else you want to mention today? Lee: We all know we are moving fast. We want to be a leader. It could mean we’re taking the bullet. We want to step inside the door. We were incredibly excited for this new opportunity. It’ll be fun.\ntitle: “Kyu Lee Interview Why Com2Us Holdings Pivoted Into Blockchain Games \" ShowToc: true date: “2022-12-22” author: “Brittany Bell” In 2016, the Seoul-based company invested in a big cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea in the year 2020 and was invested in the Wysiwyg studio.

I have hoped for partners and invested in Animoca, Sandbox, Upland and Mythical Games. They changed its name to Com2Us Holdings and Gamevil.
That company is going to be pivoting in a major way through free-to-play games that have brought great prosperity and partnerships with brands like the NBA. The entire family is entering NFT and other blockchain technologies. You’ll always be aware of that, especially if you take these types of things like it, and focus on them, in the same way that it focused many years ago on playing free games.
It makes Com2Us one of the biggest mobile game companies to move into NFT. Since it was founded in 1998 and has a son in South Korea, Com2uS became a subsidiary of mobile game developer Gamevil in 2013 (and now the whole company is Com2Us Holdings). Com2Us Summoners War has more than 100 million downloads and sales worth $2 billion.
The upcoming Com2U games are Chromatic Soul: AFK, Kritika: the White Knights, Project MR, and Summoners War: Chronicles. Baseball Superstars, World of Zenonia and The Great Merchant will also be available soon.
I caught up with Lee about this pivot, and gave him an edited transcript of the interview.

GamesBeat: It looks a huge point for Gamevil and Com2U. Could you discuss the context and the underlying question?
Kyu Lee: In 2020, we started investing in Coinone. Coinone is the third largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea. We always longed in the blockchain space, but there weren’t any action items available, so the whole thing to do. We knew there was a lot of traction there. We knew that we should learn a little more about it. We decided to invest in an exchange. It would be the best way to start learning.
The NBA’s top shot became apparent again. In some way, since we also involved in the sports collectible market, we have four games with Major League Baseball, and one game with the NBA, we were trying to figure out NFTs. We thought it would become a mass market. The NBA was the first place to be in this list.
When we saw the numbers coming from Axie Infinity, we played a game. We saw that there is a lot of opportunity. There are so many hurdles in the game that it was unbelievable, but it was also unbelievable that it was generating a lot of money and so many people were playing. That’s what got us here. We began talking to the internal production team to make this thing real. We started by thinking about the games. Our manager, Yong Kuk Lee, really likes it. He was always thinking about the metamorphic stuff.
Between them, we acquired a company called Wysiwyg studio. Wysiwyg Studios is a South Korean company publicly listed. They’re originally a VFX studio. They have done lots of things in the metaverse preparation field, so to speak. However, when we bought them, we did it because we thought that Netflix was the new app store for all of the television producers in Korea. South Korea has some great talent, but they did not let them distribute their content through local broadcast channels. With Netflix, there’s more room for theres a big company called Studio Dragon, which sells some great deals of content from Netflix. We thought we had more money left to do, so we thought we should acquire Wysiwyg and roll up a lot of TV production studios under it.
Is there anything the entertainment business, the webtoons and the IP creation they did? They always wanted to partner with a gaming company and we always wanted to expand our IP. We do that on our partnership with Skybound, but how could we do more? The vision we had was amazing. All of these things were pointed in a direction which we had to go. We had to do a metaverse. We must play on the blockchain. We’ve got to do NFTs. That’s how we ended up investing in Candy.com. Candy.com has exclusive rights for Major League Baseball NFTs. We went in with Insight and Softbank. We invested ten million dollars in this area.

Our company took the turn of their production, looking for the right blockchain and the right partners, but we found that money could move faster. We started talking to all the top players in the blockchain gaming field. We ended up using the following materials: Animoca, Sandbox, Upland and Mythical Games. Those were the four investment we made, too. All these were really late-stage, already established companies, but to get our feet back in and understand what’s happening, establish a relationship within the ecosystem and promote that we are not just a gaming company, but we want to become a gaming company, too.
I think it worked very well. After we began doing those investments, many of these rounds were oversubscribed, but I think everyone felt happy to have a gaming company. We were not the world’s largest gaming company, but a new gaming company got on their cap table. We were very happy at our entrance into the space. We have to put up a new budget. We were very happy about it. I’ve gotten closer to investing in the majority of companies. We want to live like the anime team. That looks pretty cool.
Our approach in ourselves thought about a lot of different chains. There are so many fasmos and solutions that we could have adopted. I like what Solana is doing and how they build up an ecosystem that will be awesome to run games, due to the speed and all that. However, we decided to work with Terra. Terra is a South Korean company, an established crypto company. This means they have an amazing ecosystem. I was very shocked they weren’t as well-known in the West. They have always gained traction in the past few months, but they have still been very popular.
When you do only a simple game or a DeFi, it doesn’t gain much traction among the app developers or the entertainment space, where we’re located. After they announced their smart contracts, I think that lots of projects are being built on Terra. It is difficult for our development team to swallow the sack of hundreds of pages of documents. It’s amazing having a South Korean team Do Kwan, the CEO. His team was perfect for us. We’re extremely happy about our relationship to Terra. We’re building an NFT platform with a big name of K-pop and all the entertainment companies we have. It’ll also have fun. We’ll also use them as our blockchain partner. We’re building wallets together and all that else should be done to support our games.

GamesBeat: You look like a full-pocket pivot. Do you still plan to do mobile games, non-no-nft and non-blockchain?
Lee: There are many restrictions about how we can support our games and how we can stand them. The most interesting thing I learned, though, is that once you get to this side of the world, the other side would look stale and boring. The world’s been going on forever since I was telling friends. I’m the one who talks about this thing on every level, like myself. It sounds like a new way of getting mobile. A happy moment to get all you can. Make sure youre always on the beat. It is very rewarding.
We have numerous products which will launch as planned. Hopefully a lot of our producer heads will become more open-minded about moving over. They are launching games later on. They probably needed something new such a thing.
GamesBeat: The developers themselves want to try this one.
Lee: “Yes.” This is enough to give you a lot of time. I first noticed that a time when the App Store arrived in the first place, I thought, Oh, lets have a virtual currency running across all of the games. Let’s make a market where users can buy and sell. We got this idea. By following the rules, we uncovered a definite way of thinking. With all these technologies helping game developers, you realize, Oh, I forgot we were able to do that. We have met many of those moments. It’s another great tool for game developers to express themselves. If you want to use this tool, we’d encourage that.
Evidently, there are some games which are much better worked in the web2 world. But there will be many new kinds of games that will be well seen in the web3.
GamesBeat: Is there a certain percentage of the company that is dedicated to working on this, or is it basically everyone working on it?
Lee: At the moment it everyone is. The order has been delivered by top company. Each student gets through the learning curve. We started out having a small team, but now there are a lot of different projects involved so it doesn’t make any secret. It’s not just one or two projects. We already announced about 10 new projects. We pivoted a lot of games which we were planning on opening this year or early next year, and put them back together so they are playing a play-to-earn or NFT aspect.
If you remember the moment we first made purchases on the App Store, I don’t think every game suddenly went over to free-to-play, followed by the true spirit of free-to-play. There were very little efforts to adopt animals. I think I’m going through that same process pretty much completely. There isn’t anything on offer. What a good one. The best games I think were in a lot of fail, but at least from a gaming perspective. All the games I’ve had so far, they’re good, but very good production quality. A lot of the games that were releasing are, even in the next year, in development.

GamesBeat: Did you see Ubisoft announcement in Ghost Recon Breakpoint?
I saw that link.
The tiniest of steps is GamesBeat. I think this is meant to educate the market and gain acceptance from people. This is a very strict control to people who play the Ghost Recon so many times. And even those who buy to the secondary market should have played the game, too. They don’t sell the non-profits. They are making you even better when they’re taking this step. Why people are negative, they are angry about the stunt.
Lee: There’s going to be lots of baby steps. But these games will look much better. Many new projects are launching from the beginning, so they’ll probably try to find out how they can use that technology as much as they can. And those games are taking another two, three, four, or many years. Who knows? There are plenty of new trends.
Right now we saw Axie Infinity. Everybody thinks in that mentality. In South Korea wrangle was Mir 4, made by Wemade. That game was totally opposite. They switched a free-to-play game and just added some play-to-play aspects. Now suddenly people realize you can do that. Those new kinds of economics will be a big factor, although we don’t work on the production team. That’s my experience.
Gamesbeat: Have you seen any resistance of gamers? I know that Ubisoft does know that some of them are now happening. It seems like the hardcore players are associated with things like loot boxes and scams, and aggressive monetization.
Lee: We haven’t seen much from our users yet. I’ve seen it at other games. Even Cookie Run announced they would do Cookie Run NFTs and they faced huge backlash. Well have to see. The same thing happened when everyone switched to play free and using loot boxes. It will require much education. I think we’re filling in a gap and will provide a lot more value to our users at the same time.
Even Crypto itself has many negative associations around it, no matter how big or large it is and when it comes to environmental impact or money laundering, it has itself. It’s a very powerful tool, but it’s not only a huge instrument. We just need to try to use that kind of thing.
Above: Kate, the White Knights will come in Q1 2022.
Image credit: Com2Us.
GamesBeat: How soon will any of these things arrive? How are you planning on 2022?
Lee: I don’t know what I’ll get on first. Our schedules always change. In fact, most of the games will come around the middle of the next year.
GamesBeat: Anything else you want to mention today?
Lee: We all know we are moving fast. We want to be a leader. It could mean we’re taking the bullet. We want to step inside the door. We were incredibly excited for this new opportunity.
