I think the teams sense of urgency, even though they are not really intense on the road to launch, always increases post-launch. The fact that player feedback certainly increases volume and diversity, leads to the much-needed reduction in priorities and new challenges in our to-do list. The team sometimes feels overwhelmed, but we need to make our players happy. We like to focus on the things that will improve the game for most of the players. I’m responsible for the Crowfall game and service. We’ve been working on major updates running 5-6 weeks long, and many hotfixes were published to the Live-only service. Upon development of Crowfall, we monitor the feedback from our customers consistently, and that feedback becomes the predominant input to the decision to come forward. As Todd said about our first livestream post-launch post-launch, he is focused on something new within ArtCraft. This new initiative isn’t related to Crowfall and will not be publicly available either soon or a later date. I always planned to run Crowfall after being live, and I hope that the game/service stays true to our first expectations and the vision we laid out for the game. We wanted an action-fight action game and a re-released strategy game based on territory control, with actual winners and losers in each campaign. We wanted to help competitive players with the assistance of providing a game where their character and actual player skills mattered, but avoiding the odds and disadvantages that dominate such competitive online games. Our goal is to put equal odds at all competitors of our campaigns. We wanted an economy that aims to make players the best things that are required in game. It was not only a ten-minute film we wanted to create a story where interdependency really got lost and was crucial to our experience. Our new Freemium program (free trial play for 10 days) is a great way to get more people involved to try Crowfall. We know our trial-clients who take part in the campaigns with their friends get the best experience about Crowfall and will likely become long-term players. We wanted to lower the barrier to try our game and to encourage current players to bring their friends with our Crow Recruits/Buddy reward program that now rewards both the invited Buddy and the present player. If players Buddy is already in free trial, they can still add a Buddy code to their account. We retroactively added this new reward to the prior Buddy code trial players as that’s just fair. We also reduced game price to 14,99 dollars. Together, these should make it easier for everyone to try our game and to see whether Crowfall can resonate with them. Every person who bought the game 60 days before our reduced to $14.99 price will receive more than $25 worth of Crowns ($3,000) on their account to cover the difference between the new and the old price. Last year, we reduced the price of many Eternal Kingdom items and then lowered the price of all those who were directly purchased. We again want to be fair to our customers. This release is our first attempt in which he has intended to use small scale PvP and as the players learn, it will also be very enjoyable for us. Crowfall was founded first with the aim of large scale PvP siege combat, but to achieve that goal, but people don’t like to play with their smaller guilds and not be obliterated. In the open world game is very hard to encourage something that appears to be a fair fight from a small guild perspective. In this way we have added mechanics and content in 7.300 to the small scale as possible. Before we could change it, we can limit the number of players in a given zone. This will make the competitive field more fair. Secondly, we changed the working habits of the Forts and built up Mines. Forts are pre-built bases and generate Conquest points with building buffs and crafting stations. Forts are mainly found in zones with the smallest number of Alliance players allowed. Given the close location and all the services being built, these bases are ideal for the smaller players. Mines are specialized construction and maintenance work in these specialized industries. The mines can be fought and claimed so that the victors can get access to the building materials. We have got early feedback that players want even bigger groups (6-12 players) PvP options and that would certainly be something we could add in the next update, as we can now turn zones to whatever size we want. Whats really exciting design-wise is working to integrate these different experiences into Crowfall so that players can find competition that matches the size of their team, and they always have the option to ally with others when and if they want the larger competitive experiences we offer. You’re correct that the Victory Card system was our answer to give players a way to win with many different activities, and these activities change every time the seasons change. (e.g. spring and summer you’ll try to harvest the most items, and summer can destroy most buildings in the enemy Keeps.) We used to focus large guilds to excel at things in the form of a Keep, especially if they would be the owner of a Victory Card. We will add additional Victory Cards for activities around Forts and things that were one of the lower allies. While not necessarily giving minor guilds an advantage, it is not necessary to give them a competitive competitive position. We’re beginning to investigate activities like the Shadow, so we can improve the amount of time that you have to earn rewards for the campaign. This makes it easier for us to increase the number of rewards players earn in that Campaign type. This also gives us more really cool and powerful items, such as rewards for Victory Cards. Finally, it realizes our initial objectives for Crowfall. Yes, our future goal for Eternal Kingdoms is to better cerviability and buyability of vendors. We want to re-enroll the EKs, for example. We want to greatly improve the shopping experience over the next couple of milestones, so be careful what will come next. We added more EK items to the store and use them to deliver more of the product for Twitch and streamer drops. I think this is an underrated part of Crowfall as it is possible to build a collaborative Kingdom in which you can build a large space in a campaign game. That new player experience, which we launched in response, was a significant area of feedback from our player base. Were streamlined the customized character experience, to get players through it more efficiently and the best way to learn more about Crowfall. We added archetype options for an advanced pass new player experience for those players impatient to take action in a game. Good be monitoring the data, as customers are using these and improve them from this data and feedback. Consider that Crowfall has many archetypes, which are often the most important. The major update on the main point of the game is a small-scale operation, as well as major chat system update and new player experience improvements, but we also have a lot more to do with this update (as usual). We added your teammates a legend along with a pin and for recent deaths. In-games for siege and period-time when your holdings are being smashed are greatly improved. Armor can now become stronger in combat; with many upgrades to your strength, they can add many stronger skills. Campaign rewards are much more valuable. Consequently, we must take part in a variety of campaigns. If you’re looking for the perfect way of removing this stuff, try searching for the ingredient to add more ingredients to your recipe. If you do not find any stains, the station is ready. We added more mine and fort types to the campaigns, and had the addition of new dynamic buff pedestals at aposts. The Eternal Kingdom is experiencing a lot of changes. For example, in a land in an EK, Nobles and Vassals can now launch a EK alongside dozens of fixes and polish additions. We made several more poor quality of life fixes that the players requested. Plus we put on nine designs now on our forums since August, and we expect to put up a couple more next month that are now progressing. We liked the feedback made by our players at launch. So, we focus on improving things people found wanting in the experience, and with the vision of Crowfall. Finally we’ll be changing the horizon. We’ll add quality-of-life features which players demand (which represents a lot of customer feedback we receive). One of the feedback we received was that your game becomes a PvE+PvP experience as a game X, and we did never forget our goal for Crowfall. We’re focused on competitive gameplay and a community that deals with that type of experience. Not sure these will all be considered big changes but, as mentioned above, were definitely doing some work on extending/refining more small-scale PvP-options within Crowfall and additions to the Eternal Kingdom. Well, focus also on the flexible UI, Dueling Arenas, Skins/Weapon skins, even more map improvements, leaderboard extensions, a range of campaign length, handshake denges and repurposing HungerDome. If the game is all up to date, always add more content. There are many other improvements/alterations to life of quality. To begin with, we want our players to know that the live team listens to their feedback and strives to serve them and improves the Crowfall experience with every update. The new update to the Crowfall Global Conquest brings significant changes to the world. Fight or Kite: Crowfalls latest release brings RvR and pop-up PvP in the forefront of the industry. Fight or the kite: Crowfalls start a struggle, but it’s not a challenge. I’m ready to play. Feight or Kite: Crowfalls Transformation had the necessary polish to get closer to the launch. If you want to get to the roth, it’s good to get to swarm a slack of water. For the best – or for the best: Early thoughts on Crowfalls are inseparable – beta, necromancy, and alts, – and wilds. Fight or to swarm: The examination of the world’s newy-type systems, from a God of the Word to the world. Doing Terror or Kling: Deep-diving Crowfalls Dreg RvR gameplay. Fight or Kite: Surveying Crowfall new Frostweaver class and interface updates, each update is complete. Fight or kask: Crowfalls new infected content is the most valuable jolly added to the pre-alpha. The Rise of the King’s and the Fire – Seeing the floods as God’s return. Any battle is an evil witch. A correction is necessary every day to take over the sword. Fear is fear. Be a bear in line with Crowfall. Press release: Crowfall is now free to try a multiplayer game by type of a large, multiplayer version of the game launches freemium and reduces price; small scale multiplayer options, simplified new player experience part of major update. AUSTIN, Texas, November 8, 2021ArtCraft Entertainment, creators of the G3M MMO game, Crowfall, is lowering the cost of the game and providing an online exchange for all new players. Crowfalls freemium plan provides free trial for new players. After that, the players buy that game at a low price of $14.99 and never play them. The new service comes as ArtCraft is making a major update today for Crowfall. We know the free trial will attract many MMO players, said Gordon Walton, artCrafts executive producer. We had some very significant upgrades in this latest update, too. We simplified the new player experience. Now we’re allowing smaller scale PvP experiences. Crowfall was invented to fight diege. It was a key goal for several hundred players. Now we have added smaller team sizes PvP so that we can accommodate the guilds that our players have in. We listened to our players’ feedback and delivered what they were asking for. If 20-50 people grow, they have to die and hold forts in Crowfall if there are no bigger guilds. Guilds of 10-25 can influence the outcome of the game by holding large forts, mines, and outposts and deny them to other factions. The games Alliance system has been expanded so that smaller guilds can regroup and enjoy in-game as well as biggest guilds. Crowfall was created in the first place with the idea of large-scale PVP siege combat being the focus of the project, said Walton. Although it is definitely fun for a certain group of people, there are other groups of players who want to be able to play with their smaller guilds, and not get involved. In a game of open world, it’s difficult to encourage a fair fight, and of course it seems to be from a small guild perspective. Besides, the update streamlines the initial new player experience and adds a pass quickly new player experience to the impatient experts so that they can use PvP as quickly as possible. Other latest features include: The user experience significantly improved, with player configurability and general utility. New maps support multiple new navigation and performance enhancements. Campaign rewards for the guilds/factions much more valuable than a guild/faction. Expanded our Crow recruit buddy program, so that he can reward the buddy and player who invite them to the game. Crowfall is now free to try, page 2 of the list is no longer there. A big improvement for the Eternal Kingdom and craft games if you do not have one. Add additional quality-of-life elements to player requests. To start releasing the news, Crowfall will bring back the Decapathon event. The meeting is always a fan favorite – all at all, from 8 November to mid-December. Players unleash their axes to win if they defeat enemies like those they won in PvP and then sacrifice them to the evils. There are a board for this event which allows the most effective PvP players to know all the time.

We liked the feedback made by our players at launch. So, we focus on improving things people found wanting in the experience, and with the vision of Crowfall. Finally we’ll be changing the horizon. We’ll add quality-of-life features which players demand (which represents a lot of customer feedback we receive). One of the feedback we received was that your game becomes a PvE+PvP experience as a game X, and we did never forget our goal for Crowfall. We’re focused on competitive gameplay and a community that deals with that type of experience.
Not sure these will all be considered big changes but, as mentioned above, were definitely doing some work on extending/refining more small-scale PvP-options within Crowfall and additions to the Eternal Kingdom. Well, focus also on the flexible UI, Dueling Arenas, Skins/Weapon skins, even more map improvements, leaderboard extensions, a range of campaign length, handshake denges and repurposing HungerDome. If the game is all up to date, always add more content. There are many other improvements/alterations to life of quality.
To begin with, we want our players to know that the live team listens to their feedback and strives to serve them and improves the Crowfall experience with every update.
The new update to the Crowfall Global Conquest brings significant changes to the world. Fight or Kite: Crowfalls latest release brings RvR and pop-up PvP in the forefront of the industry. Fight or the kite: Crowfalls start a struggle, but it’s not a challenge. I’m ready to play. Feight or Kite: Crowfalls Transformation had the necessary polish to get closer to the launch. If you want to get to the roth, it’s good to get to swarm a slack of water. For the best – or for the best: Early thoughts on Crowfalls are inseparable – beta, necromancy, and alts, – and wilds. Fight or to swarm: The examination of the world’s newy-type systems, from a God of the Word to the world. Doing Terror or Kling: Deep-diving Crowfalls Dreg RvR gameplay. Fight or Kite: Surveying Crowfall new Frostweaver class and interface updates, each update is complete. Fight or kask: Crowfalls new infected content is the most valuable jolly added to the pre-alpha. The Rise of the King’s and the Fire – Seeing the floods as God’s return. Any battle is an evil witch. A correction is necessary every day to take over the sword. Fear is fear. Be a bear in line with Crowfall.
Press release: Crowfall is now free to try a multiplayer game by type of a large, multiplayer version of the game launches freemium and reduces price; small scale multiplayer options, simplified new player experience part of major update.
AUSTIN, Texas, November 8, 2021ArtCraft Entertainment, creators of the G3M MMO game, Crowfall, is lowering the cost of the game and providing an online exchange for all new players. Crowfalls freemium plan provides free trial for new players. After that, the players buy that game at a low price of $14.99 and never play them. The new service comes as ArtCraft is making a major update today for Crowfall.
We know the free trial will attract many MMO players, said Gordon Walton, artCrafts executive producer. We had some very significant upgrades in this latest update, too. We simplified the new player experience. Now we’re allowing smaller scale PvP experiences. Crowfall was invented to fight diege. It was a key goal for several hundred players. Now we have added smaller team sizes PvP so that we can accommodate the guilds that our players have in. We listened to our players’ feedback and delivered what they were asking for.
If 20-50 people grow, they have to die and hold forts in Crowfall if there are no bigger guilds. Guilds of 10-25 can influence the outcome of the game by holding large forts, mines, and outposts and deny them to other factions. The games Alliance system has been expanded so that smaller guilds can regroup and enjoy in-game as well as biggest guilds.
Crowfall was created in the first place with the idea of large-scale PVP siege combat being the focus of the project, said Walton. Although it is definitely fun for a certain group of people, there are other groups of players who want to be able to play with their smaller guilds, and not get involved. In a game of open world, it’s difficult to encourage a fair fight, and of course it seems to be from a small guild perspective. Besides, the update streamlines the initial new player experience and adds a pass quickly new player experience to the impatient experts so that they can use PvP as quickly as possible. Other latest features include:
The user experience significantly improved, with player configurability and general utility. New maps support multiple new navigation and performance enhancements. Campaign rewards for the guilds/factions much more valuable than a guild/faction. Expanded our Crow recruit buddy program, so that he can reward the buddy and player who invite them to the game. Crowfall is now free to try, page 2 of the list is no longer there. A big improvement for the Eternal Kingdom and craft games if you do not have one. Add additional quality-of-life elements to player requests.
To start releasing the news, Crowfall will bring back the Decapathon event. The meeting is always a fan favorite – all at all, from 8 November to mid-December. Players unleash their axes to win if they defeat enemies like those they won in PvP and then sacrifice them to the evils. There are a board for this event which allows the most effective PvP players to know all the time.
