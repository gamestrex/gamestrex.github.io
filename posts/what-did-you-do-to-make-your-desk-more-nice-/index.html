No matter how much time we spend sitting by the office, we genuinely play and work, but talking to friends and chatting, and hopefully minding our ergonomics. As we like to set up a comfortable bed for all the waking activities we do, we want to have a comfortable environment at our desks. Sure, we have our PCs, our monitors, our headsets, our mice, and our microphones. But what do you add? That’s our question this week: What do you think you can do to make your desk easier? Here we’ve got the answers from the PC Gamer team below, and I’d love to hear you in the comments, too.\nCoffee’s warmer. Lauren Morton, Editor: I can’t express enough that I’m not joking when I say this stupid, very cheap coffee warmer has shortened my desk life. A friend came to me a few years ago and I replaced it with an identical one after years of mugs and years of mugs finally stripped away too much of the heating pad coating. I drink three cups of coffee a morning, but at a time very slowly. I used to run upstairs to the microwave several times a day where I’d inevitably let my cup get cold by accident. Never ever once again.\nMonitor stand. Evan Lahti, Global Editor-in-Chief: This one costs $60, isn’t it? It’s very good to have a second tier on your desk, and some layers tositstuff on and under. I put a speaker atop what I use for general audio playback, at the moment I’m not playing game that merits headsets. And the drawer is a rack for all kinds of necessary pieces of waste: stamps, batteries, chapsticks, USB stick chains, knives.\nA tidie-banded mouse Tim Clark, Brand Director: In terms of actual computer software, Wes turned me into an avid reader of the internet a few years ago, and I’ve been using aLogitech since then. That’s a bit like a swap from a stick shift to an automaticyour former life suddenly is absurdly primitive. Everything is more appropriate. When I do my desk frippery, my middle-sister bought one of thoseplasma balls a few birthdays ago. And though I don’t have it too often, I do that because it delights me.\nA fake cat makes no sense. He’s a fake cat in the room. I used this to make the desk look more nice.\nMicrofiber cloth Tyler Wilde, executive editor: My last pair of glasses came with a superlarge microfiber cleaning cloth. It is my favorite desk thing now. If you don’t wear glasses, look at your monitor through photographic evidence of ghosts. No more swirling around a tiny fabric square, moving the smudge in circles, then accidentally touching the lens while trying to find a cleaner piece of cloth. So I can cover my entire hand in microfiber and become more than human. When the smudges start to win against the otherworldwide Cloth, I wash it, let it dry, clean my glasses with warm water and Dawn dish soap, and then wash the laundered cloth with large surfaces to dry them. I will never return to a Small Clothoase oasalbe.\nThe house has a whole new kitchenette. Natalie Clayton, Showcase Producer: Is it boring to say “a better desk”? The back of the room was blocked when Scotland entered the second lockdown and I was forced to ditch my co-working space in Leith. I became a wally desk with plates in the front room. The keyboard hanging on one side and monitor stand on the other side, with a slight wobble to make the entire affair feel extra precarious. It seemed to me just in time, but instead of trying to be able to use a perfectly unremarkable Ikea desk the other month, and besides the immediate thrill of the temptation to be a DIY expert, it became the wee touch I needed to make this space feel less like an office and less like an empty room. Just kidding. My real answer is the now 3D-printed Apex Legends gravity lift I got off Etsy.\nBooks. It’s a little strange. John Strike, Art Editor: A temporary desk is a few inches too short. The books that I’ve used to build them include: the book “We hung together”. The Expectant Dad’s Survival Guide: A comprehensive need to know for new fathers, which’s also been used as a coaster. Pompeii: The Erotic Secrets: An inexplicable Christmas gift from my parents showcasing some of the finest pornography in the ancient Rome. No one wants to go back. A book from Tim Weaver’s David Raker crime series focuses on ten. Fascinating fact: Tom Weaver was my manager and publisher of Xbox World Magazine. The All Day Cookbook, condemned to life in the ground by the plight of those who demande change.\nThere’s a little fan. Christopher Livingston, Episode 1: The little fan and fabric paddles. It’s quiet, it provides a nice bread, but the place is still where you are sitting comfortably on your desk, and therefore you don’t have a grill like many fans so it doesn’t ever get dusty or dirty. The fabric paddle lets you stick hands out of it and it won’t hurt if it happened to my dumb cat. I like that so much that I bought another table for the dining room table.\nFraser Brown A bottle For example, I drank some Irn Bru, like the most day. Does that bottle with empty stomach make me look a bit better on my desk? Who can say it? But my thirst is cashed, and it’s nice.\n","wordCount":"937","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-20T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mercedes Powell"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/what-did-you-do-to-make-your-desk-more-nice-/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>What Did You Do To Make Your Desk More Nice</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 20, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;937 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Mercedes Powell</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#coffees-warmer>Coffee’s warmer.</a></li><li><a href=#monitor-stand>Monitor stand.</a></li><li><a href=#a-tidie-banded-mouse>A tidie-banded mouse</a></li><li><a href=#a-fake-cat-makes-no-sense>A fake cat makes no sense.</a></li><li><a href=#microfiber-cloth>Microfiber cloth</a></li><li><a href=#the-house-has-a-whole-new-kitchenette>The house has a whole new kitchenette.</a></li><li><a href=#books-its-a-little-strange>Books.
