With two players he divided his attention perfectly, stayed out of range of the giant axe attacks and whittled him down with powerful magic as he turned up his back. Ha! He talks quietly, but he’s lying in bed. All my fears were in the hands of my team, but so far I lost our hope of fighting Margit the Fell, then went back to the equator over a single fight and got lost at least a dozen times. I was tired, but I didn’t focus on learning and reacting to Margit’s movingset. And like many of the souls bosses, Margit is demanding that kind of egostress. He’s fast, runs hard, and has a great arsenal of moves to hit you with, both close and far away. The windows to win are very small. This is a tough fight with exciting people. If you have trouble taking the Margit down, I’ve been there, so I can help. Here are the tactics you must learn, and some tricks to ease the fight.\nMargit the Fell’s attacks to watch out for the threat of a sexy tyre. – Whenever you are sitting right behind Margit after he finishes an attack combination, you’ll probably be safe for a few seconds and probably he’ll do a whining attack to hit you with his tail. It’s fast, so be ready for it. Magic blade – In the first half of the fight, Margit primarily attacks with two weapons: the staff in his right hand and a glowing magic blade (which still does physical damage) summoned in her left arm. The staff attack is a relatively slow, heavy hit, but Margit summons the sword to deliver a fast, close-range combo even if he’s in the recovery animation. This is the assault that gave me the most trouble, because he used it always when I thought that I had an opening. Be safe; try not to enter one attack before sweeping away your shield or putting up your shield. Thrower – When you retreat to heal, Margit loves to summon two of those magic blades again and throw them at you. If you’re not able to drink from your sloppy face and drink, strafe towards you so he can’t hit you. If you are ready for them, they’re easy to dodge. Combos – The danger of the fight is Margit’s unpredictable combo patterns. Sometimes he’ll swing once or twice, and sometimes he’ll bring a spinning attack to a multi-hit sequence. Do not attack her. Just block or dodge backwards, if you don’t think you are out of range, the staff can’t help you. I think that blocking is easier, because he’ll swing multiple times in a row. Generally, you want to keep your distance away and wait for his hammer jump, which gives you a much more simple opening. Hammer jump – This is Margit’s heaviest hit, but this is the best window when you dodge properly. After his health got worse, Margit will summon a giant glowing hammer with his left hand. After a very big explosion, he’ll swing it at you, but when you reach the end of the stage, he’ll leap out and turn it back on the other side. You want to bait this out, then roll towards him at the last minute, dodging through the impact and reaching close to Margit. This will give you a few seconds of security to wail him.\nIf you are not using magic, convert everything in the kernel to Crimson Tears. These things are a little expensive, but they’ll help you with a lot of healing power. When we are a “Piece of Lost Grace”, we can balance the use of Crimson Tears (HP) and Cerulean Tears (FP). Bring the four of them to Crimson Tears. In order to drink some life-giving liquid, you’re given four different ways to drink it. If you don’t use magic attacks to do damage, you need at least one flask of Urulean Tears to refill your FP. Start by getting by and run out of FP before Margit gets done for yourself.\nCan you take a spirit sword to distract Margit? Spirit Ashes are Elden Ring’s version of summonable NPCs like Solaire, but this time they are items you can buy and reuse throughout the game. You can buy two ashes from Merchant Kale near Limgrave: the Lone Wolf and the Noble Sorcerer Ashes. The Lone Wolf Ashes are very good for this fight because they spawn three wolves that allow Margit to move for a long time. You aren’t counting on them for damages. They only need to live alive long enough to escape your aggro, so you can snag some hits.\nMagic users: Attack with Beast Claws or Glintstone Stars. Both of these spells hit Margit hard, and combined with the Lone Wolf Ashes, you can deal him very easily while avoiding his cries. If you want to start a fight of one-on-one, it’s easier to use magic, but still very doable. Beast Claws are a starting spell for the Prophet’s class and are based on faith. The spell is a fantastic moveand that it’s very useful for you, so please be careful not to damage it as well. There is a tendency Margit is to throw knives and jump attacks in order to smash at range very quickly. If you feel Margit’s range, you can stand off, charge Beast Claws, and get out of harm. Do not try to defend this attack when you are close. Unlike other methods of dealing with the enemy in the near vicinity. Unlike most other enemies, it’s quite dangerous to do that. Glintstone Stars is a sorcery that produces three magic weapons which come into the realm of the Magical. You can get this from Sorceress Sellen, who appears in the post town Remains on the eastern edge of the map after killing the pumpkin head Boss. To find Post Town Objects, cross the bridge and look for ruins full of plants (heads up, one of them will shoot magic beams of light at you). A stairway leading to the ruins leads to the boss chamber. Watch out for a safe range when casting Glintstone stars. So, don’t you wanna be nailed for being stuck in your casting.\nBring the Crucible armor set up. The strongest and most powerful armor in the network test will protect your defense far better than in the starting gears of most of the classes, especially the Prophet or Champion. The Crucible is easy to find, and when you use the most powerful tools, you could wear it on an enviable level. To find the Crucible set, head to the east side of Limgrave and look for the carriage hauled by two giants, with the procession of knights and undead racing towards it. It’s difficult to miss. Follow, stop stomping, and repeat, but only stomp, then take the giants down. The back of the carriage will be accessible.\nQuick Margit with the Dragonscale Blade. One of the most powerful weapon arts in this early bit of Elden Ring is the weapon to the sword of the Dragonscale blade called Hailstorm Sword. Hailstorm Sword called ice-lightning bolt which makes the weapon to do both types of elemental damage for about twenty seconds. Just because of this, it’s the case that if you can squeeze sufficient succession hits on Margit slowly enough, it’s ice which will affect him and cause damage. Because he’s so fast, it’s hard to pull off, but for a little more, Margit is worth a few bucks. Dragonscales are great weapons for faith builds. In spite of its ability to assemble, they scale on strength, dexterity and faith. You can get it by killing the troll boss in the Limgrave Tunnels mine, which you can find right right in the northern tip of the lake-slash-swamp, the centre of the map.\n","wordCount":"1334","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-04T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Victor Campbell"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/how-to-beat-margit-the-fell-omen-the-elden-rings-toughest-boss-on-the-network-test/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>How To Beat Margit The Fell Omen The Elden Rings Toughest Boss On The Network Test</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 4, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1334 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Victor Campbell</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#margit-the-fells-attacks-to-watch-out-for-the-threat-of-a-sexy-tyre>Margit the Fell’s attacks to watch out for the threat of a sexy tyre.</a></li><li><a href=#if-you-are-not-using-magic-convert-everything-in-the-kernel-to-crimson-tears>If you are not using magic, convert everything in the kernel to Crimson Tears.</a></li><li><a href=#can-you-take-a-spirit-sword-to-distract-margit>Can you take a spirit sword to distract Margit?</a></li><li><a href=#magic-users-attack-with-beast-claws-or-glintstone-stars>Magic users: Attack with Beast Claws or Glintstone Stars.</a></li><li><a href=#bring-the-crucible-armor-set-up>Bring the Crucible armor set up.</a></li><li><a href=#quick-margit-with-the-dragonscale-blade>Quick Margit with the Dragonscale Blade.</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>(Image credit: from software)
I tried to beat the Flesh Omen at the first level of the university-study. With two players he divided his attention perfectly, stayed out of range of the giant axe attacks and whittled him down with powerful magic as he turned up his back. Ha! He talks quietly, but he’s lying in bed. All my fears were in the hands of my team, but so far I lost our hope of fighting Margit the Fell, then went back to the equator over a single fight and got lost at least a dozen times.
