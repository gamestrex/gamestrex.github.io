BridTV2994Escape from Tarkov Action Gameplay Trailer815851815851center26546.\nEscape From Tarkov Update 0.12.12 Notes for Patch, maintenance schedule, Wipe Today. Key modifications:\nJust added the Lighthouse location. The lighthouse at Cape Dalniy was an important strategic object on the way to Tarkov. The USEC headquarters operated during the Contract Wars. The old owners returned to Tarkov, who decided to stay and take their own orders. This is the first Ireon of this location. Continually, the area will be expanded and be expanded. The Lighthouse location will feature the new AI-type ex-USEC operatives, also called Rogues. These are a gang of former PMCs who worked together previously. They’re well-armed, well trained, and use coordinated combat tactics. They’ve got similar interests as the Raiders but united around a military past. Rogue USEPs took over water treatment equipment and threw everything out there. Security cameras and gunmen are installed on the perimeter. In addition, several fighters patrol the perimeter, and a number of machines and missile launchers are available around the clock. When enemy is detected, or when enemy presence occurs, the guards open suppressive fire that will try to prevent enemy from coming to their homeland. These new bots will not be lenient to the USEC PMC faction. A USEC player won’t open fire until he attempts to enter territory. If the player gets too close, he will receive an order to leave immediately and then is shot if not with respect. If a USEC player joins a group with a BEAR PMC, both of them will be considered hostile and attacked on sight without warning. If a player does encounter a remark with the Rogues, he will be considered a traitor and dealt with in the next few raids as hostile. 3.Inertia has been added to the game so that it can play more realistic actions and move. Inertia is manifested in the following situation: Walking and strafing was a dangerous way of transporting you to the same destination. sprinting When sprinting, sharp movements may turn faster. landing after jumping or falling from height. Leaning and stepping.\nInertial force depends on the weight of equipment and Strength skill level. The more your equipment weighs, the lower the strength it’s:\nthe longer it takes to accelerate at the start of movement (walk, strafe, sprint) for a while. the longer you get to slow down after you stop (walk, strafe, sprint); the longer it takes to slow and accelerate, when moving from the opposite direction; the more movement speed falls while cruising. the higher speed of movement and the longer speed of movement decreases when landing after a jump or falls from a height; The longer it takes to lean, back to normal position and to sidestep.\nThe inertial force rises from 0 kg to 9kg for characters with Strength level and from 10 kg for those with the Elite Strength level. The inertial force becomes maximum, with 70 kg of equipment and 80 kg of equipment to suit the level 6 of the Strength section. 4. Expandedcrouching and growingmechanics. Now the length of these actions depends on the weight overtake. The number of changed positions and the number of new positions varies according to the extent of overload. 5. Expanded theweapon malfunctionsmechanics. Along with fires, weapons can now suffer from the following things:\nIf the cartridge isn’t ejectable, it’s blown and partially visible at the ejection port. The cause of this problem is, first, the technical condition of the weapon and, more often, the overheating and the cartridge characteristics. When an officer is trying to steal the weapon, he will be able to run through the cartridge. The main cause of this problem is the weapon magazine, especially those large capacity and high-diameter magazines. Other sources include cartridge characteristics, overheating of the weapon, and the technological condition of the weapon. After the bolt bolt gets jammed. Jamming can be both normal and hard. It’s only a matter of time that has been solved. The cause of the broken bolt can be just overheating the weapon or its technical condition. Hard grinding does not occur for the highest standard of the weapon.\nA defect can only occur with old weapons (with a durable of 93%), except a defect caused by overheating. Many types of weapons can’t be very well designed because of their construction or operation. Now, you must first determine the type of work that is not appropriate for fixing the malfunction. In order to do that, you need to control the malfunctioning weapon, using a weapon inspection hotkey. Characters with advanced levels of Troubleshooting will detect, whenever you do, the type of malfunction without having to inspect the weapon. When the alarm goes off immediately, a light is pressed to record what happened. The messages and sounds can be disabled in the game’s settings by checking the Malfunction notification boxes. 6. The game features weaponsoverheating and related effects. Weapons are hot after firing shots. The time of the gun is dependent on the cartridge, the barrel and the other heating-related elements of the weapon (receiver, muzzle devices, sandguards, etc.). Unlike the heat, the weapon has gone to a very slow time. The cooling rate is, of course, dependent on the barrel and other cooling-related elements of the weapon (receivers, muzzle-watchers, handguards, etc.). The degree of overheating can be monitored by the barcode and muzzle instruments. You may have a higher order of a few stages of overheating. A negative reaction to this stage comes from the stage a lot of overheating.\nThe weapon is prone to fire, but no redness of barrel and muzzles. Resonance: Heat of the tanks, muzzle devices and handguard is visible in thermal scopes, if he has an heat haze, or if a damage is found at the barrel or muzzle devices. the gun’s reddening medium is enough, so the gun’s redness is visible. Effects: The accuracy of weapons decreases, the failure chance increases, the wear decreases, and the maximum strength of weapons decreased during firing. The gun is very heavy, the barrel and the muzzle guns are very hot. The reaction rate of fire is adjusted, there’s a possible cooking-off possibility. Once the metal temperature is reached, a malfunction occurs and the bolt is damaged.\nI improved my ammoballistics by applying extra magnetic instruments. As far as the flow and the energy is concerned, the initial speed, liar weight, diameter, and its shape and ballistic coefficients are in consideration now. The speed and the weight of the first weapon were not forgotten a time. Through that, a complete communication can be achieved with real-time data. Aside from the loss of damage, the difference in the velocity and speed of the bullet was corrected. For example, on an angle of 5 439 m, the damage decreased from 20% to 20% when the barrel was changed for longer, thus increasing the speed of the damage, and the damage and penetrative abilities are also augmenting. However, it is worth a while to understand that for some ammunition there is no data in open sources, or they are incomplete. Such ammunition will be adjusted as needed data have been found. The maneuvering of the gear was adjusted. Reduced a fixed recoil compensation when firing long bursts. lowered the skills of training and recoil reduction bonuses. general refinements and enhancements made in the weapon recoil system.\n9.VOIP added voice communication to the system. The sound console is able to operate. This feature allows us to negotiate and coordinate the negotiations. Remember that using VOIP inappropriately can ruin your experience with other players. Insults, playing music, clogging the air, and other behavior problems as well as the user’s own rules can also make it impossible for him to use the game account.\nVOIP doesn’t work in tense mode, but instead in push-to-talk mode. Players can’t talk for more than 15 seconds in a row. It means that, every 20 seconds, when you scavenge, you can only speak for 15 seconds, regardless of whether it’s on the other hand. A very short time out will occur if you press the Push button regularly. Reports suggest the obnoxious usage of VoIP. To do this, go to the gesture menu and press the report button while the other player talks or talks two seconds ago. You can’t report members of your group. The voice’s audibility depends on the distance of the speaker, as well as other audio modifiers. Room partitions, floors, walls, active headphones, lowered visor etc. Scavs can annoy the players to speak. VOIP can easily be removed from the gesture menu or via the hotkey. The Push-to-Talk Hotkey can be resold in control settings.\nExpanded theOperational Tasks. Added the description variety to all types of operational tasks. Added stats to the player’s game. Added the exit to the specific extract condition, to the exit the location type tasks.\nAdded the ability to partly use different types of food and beverages. The effect is less than the amount consumed. The strength and the delay before the buff begins don’t change. The buffs are the only ones that count up to the original buffs value. Negative buffs don’t make up their original value. Negative buffs take into account skills (so the skill that relates to Metabolism, which helps reduce the duration of negative effects up to 50%). Negative buffs take advantage of their ability to attain the most of Metabolism. 12. New things were added: New weapons New weapon parts are added. There are 4 new handgun grenades (yet impact grenades). New equipment New items include furters. New keys New storage cases (Injector case and keycard holder) have been added. Rangefinders are a manual rangefinder and a tactical rangefinder module. Five new cartridges are available. New clothing kits for USEC and BEAR are being made for us. The new single-seat, but unique handbags have emerged. At the start of the game, new faces for both factions will have new faces.\nMore quests were added at the Lighthouse location. Graphics and optimisations are changing and optimizing. 1.Screen Space Reflection is an effect of reflection from wet or glossy surfaces or water surfaces. The technology was completely redesigned and now the reflections look more realistic, while the load on the system is noticeablely reduced. Added optimization for vegetation rendering in long distances. It helped us reduce CPU on large trees and other vegetation. Add optimization of physical collision objects. Added various optimizations in the server. SSR is now enabled by default in High and Ultra graphics presets. The picture now looks more vivid if the weather doesn’t beat the desaturation effect at all. List of fixeds: Fixed the issue where traders only restock times were not updated until the client was restarted. In the cartridge case had the trigger when he moved the flashlight to another scandal. Fixed the problem that caused Error 500 when interacting with the In-Game Location Map item – when it was insured – after it was resolved. Fixed a problem resulting in the uninsufficient lighting in the Hout. A problem arises, where bots could shoot through the factory’s walls. Correct an issue with weapons inspecting Saiga-12 and SVDS. Fixed the problem of overlapping sounds on the stairs in the 3-story dorm on the customs. The problem was that bots instantly could move to a crouched position. Fixed issue where I couldn’t create a stack of currencies or cartridges from 10 pieces. Fixed an issue where a player can open a locked door without a key, using the Breach option from around the corner. A player has fixed an issue where he can move from a prone position to a standing position if he does not change his stance during weaponloading. Fixed an issue where a lack of water filter resources could continue to decrease after the final phase of production of purified water. Fixed an issue when an expired offer on Flea Market disappeared from the My offer section in the early hours of the year. Fixed an issue where the eye protection effect of the Gorilla welding mask was not counted. Fixed an issue where stationary running animation played when leaning in a prone position. Fixed a problem where, after the Flea Market search, only one part was revealed when the cheapest one-dimensional assembly was achieved. Fixed an issue where a stock exchanger would lose value after the timer ended. Fixed an issue in which the first message appeared when I entered the Hideout. This case resolved where more bots spawned than needed in offline mode. Fixed an issue where the older pants can disappear from BEAR. This case saw an issue where a stifling polygon could be found in the Hideouts shooting range. Fixed an issue where the Glukhars guard bot wouldn’t shoot at players, even if the player still had ammo. The first test rifle of the enemy was almost stolen. You corrected the confusion and condition of the progress indicator of loading/unloading cartridges in the magazine. Fixed an issue where a click sound can play after two firings of a pistol without a silenced rifle. Fixed an issue where the level of operations was saved after a profile reset. The problem was fixed on the way to the sound of the cleft of a hotel, where one could hear the sound of a window opening on the floor in the health resort. Fixed a problem where the amount of water that went to a boil arose after the water poured. Some sound problems can be resolved with regards to overlaps. Several issues causing the error 228. There were several glitches that causing game crashes. I’ve got several fixes: Some weapons were modified (and improved), but also had new features. They removed the ability to pounce grenades quickly. When you press the hotkey, your character takes a random grenade into his hands from your chest, rig or pocket. To create the Hellostu, I created a new recipe for the Hideout. Changed the threshold for re-installation. All keys now hold durability (100 units, except that keys already have durability). There were other ways to get started like bots and player Scavs. Various balancing changes for rarity and spawn locations for items. Changes and fixes to various weapons and attachments that are different. There are many changes in the trader’s catalogue of goods. Many fixes and improvements in localization. Ensuring more complex tasks, balances. One can not put up and buy a specific item at the Flea Market – one can now use that one more item as a purchase order: A gun-proof helmet by Rys-T is required.

As far as the flow and the energy is concerned, the initial speed, liar weight, diameter, and its shape and ballistic coefficients are in consideration now. The speed and the weight of the first weapon were not forgotten a time. Through that, a complete communication can be achieved with real-time data. Aside from the loss of damage, the difference in the velocity and speed of the bullet was corrected. For example, on an angle of 5 439 m, the damage decreased from 20% to 20% when the barrel was changed for longer, thus increasing the speed of the damage, and the damage and penetrative abilities are also augmenting. However, it is worth a while to understand that for some ammunition there is no data in open sources, or they are incomplete. Such ammunition will be adjusted as needed data have been found. The maneuvering of the gear was adjusted. Reduced a fixed recoil compensation when firing long bursts. lowered the skills of training and recoil reduction bonuses. general refinements and enhancements made in the weapon recoil system.\n9.VOIP added voice communication to the system. The sound console is able to operate. This feature allows us to negotiate and coordinate the negotiations. Remember that using VOIP inappropriately can ruin your experience with other players. Insults, playing music, clogging the air, and other behavior problems as well as the user’s own rules can also make it impossible for him to use the game account.\nVOIP doesn’t work in tense mode, but instead in push-to-talk mode. Players can’t talk for more than 15 seconds in a row. It means that, every 20 seconds, when you scavenge, you can only speak for 15 seconds, regardless of whether it’s on the other hand. A very short time out will occur if you press the Push button regularly. Reports suggest the obnoxious usage of VoIP. To do this, go to the gesture menu and press the report button while the other player talks or talks two seconds ago. You can’t report members of your group. The voice’s audibility depends on the distance of the speaker, as well as other audio modifiers. Room partitions, floors, walls, active headphones, lowered visor etc. Scavs can annoy the players to speak. VOIP can easily be removed from the gesture menu or via the hotkey. The Push-to-Talk Hotkey can be resold in control settings.\nExpanded theOperational Tasks. Added the description variety to all types of operational tasks. Added stats to the player’s game. Added the exit to the specific extract condition, to the exit the location type tasks.\nAdded the ability to partly use different types of food and beverages. The effect is less than the amount consumed. The strength and the delay before the buff begins don’t change. The buffs are the only ones that count up to the original buffs value. Negative buffs don’t make up their original value. Negative buffs take into account skills (so the skill that relates to Metabolism, which helps reduce the duration of negative effects up to 50%). Negative buffs take advantage of their ability to attain the most of Metabolism. 12. New things were added: New weapons New weapon parts are added. There are 4 new handgun grenades (yet impact grenades). New equipment New items include furters. New keys New storage cases (Injector case and keycard holder) have been added. Rangefinders are a manual rangefinder and a tactical rangefinder module. Five new cartridges are available. New clothing kits for USEC and BEAR are being made for us. The new single-seat, but unique handbags have emerged. At the start of the game, new faces for both factions will have new faces.\nMore quests were added at the Lighthouse location. Graphics and optimisations are changing and optimizing. 1.Screen Space Reflection is an effect of reflection from wet or glossy surfaces or water surfaces. The technology was completely redesigned and now the reflections look more realistic, while the load on the system is noticeablely reduced. Added optimization for vegetation rendering in long distances. It helped us reduce CPU on large trees and other vegetation. Add optimization of physical collision objects. Added various optimizations in the server. SSR is now enabled by default in High and Ultra graphics presets. The picture now looks more vivid if the weather doesn’t beat the desaturation effect at all. List of fixeds: Fixed the issue where traders only restock times were not updated until the client was restarted. In the cartridge case had the trigger when he moved the flashlight to another scandal. Fixed the problem that caused Error 500 when interacting with the In-Game Location Map item – when it was insured – after it was resolved. Fixed a problem resulting in the uninsufficient lighting in the Hout. A problem arises, where bots could shoot through the factory’s walls. Correct an issue with weapons inspecting Saiga-12 and SVDS. Fixed the problem of overlapping sounds on the stairs in the 3-story dorm on the customs. The problem was that bots instantly could move to a crouched position. Fixed issue where I couldn’t create a stack of currencies or cartridges from 10 pieces. Fixed an issue where a player can open a locked door without a key, using the Breach option from around the corner. A player has fixed an issue where he can move from a prone position to a standing position if he does not change his stance during weaponloading. Fixed an issue where a lack of water filter resources could continue to decrease after the final phase of production of purified water. Fixed an issue when an expired offer on Flea Market disappeared from the My offer section in the early hours of the year. Fixed an issue where the eye protection effect of the Gorilla welding mask was not counted. Fixed an issue where stationary running animation played when leaning in a prone position. Fixed a problem where, after the Flea Market search, only one part was revealed when the cheapest one-dimensional assembly was achieved. Fixed an issue where a stock exchanger would lose value after the timer ended. Fixed an issue in which the first message appeared when I entered the Hideout. This case resolved where more bots spawned than needed in offline mode. Fixed an issue where the older pants can disappear from BEAR. This case saw an issue where a stifling polygon could be found in the Hideouts shooting range. Fixed an issue where the Glukhars guard bot wouldn’t shoot at players, even if the player still had ammo. The first test rifle of the enemy was almost stolen. You corrected the confusion and condition of the progress indicator of loading/unloading cartridges in the magazine. Fixed an issue where a click sound can play after two firings of a pistol without a silenced rifle. Fixed an issue where the level of operations was saved after a profile reset. The problem was fixed on the way to the sound of the cleft of a hotel, where one could hear the sound of a window opening on the floor in the health resort. Fixed a problem where the amount of water that went to a boil arose after the water poured. Some sound problems can be resolved with regards to overlaps. Several issues causing the error 228. There were several glitches that causing game crashes. I’ve got several fixes: Some weapons were modified (and improved), but also had new features. They removed the ability to pounce grenades quickly. When you press the hotkey, your character takes a random grenade into his hands from your chest, rig or pocket. To create the Hellostu, I created a new recipe for the Hideout. Changed the threshold for re-installation. All keys now hold durability (100 units, except that keys already have durability). There were other ways to get started like bots and player Scavs. Various balancing changes for rarity and spawn locations for items.

The mechanics of the games have been changed, too. The maintenance starts, so the game is going to be down for next few hours. Until then, you can take a look at the patch notes below.</p><h4 id=escape-from-tarkov-action-gameplay-trailer>Escape from Tarkov action gameplay trailer.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#escape-from-tarkov-action-gameplay-trailer>#</a></h4><p>BridTV2994Escape from Tarkov Action Gameplay Trailer815851815851center26546.</p><h2 id=escape-from-tarkov-update-01212-notes-for-patch-maintenance-schedule-wipe-today>Escape From Tarkov Update 0.12.12 Notes for Patch, maintenance schedule, Wipe Today.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#escape-from-tarkov-update-01212-notes-for-patch-maintenance-schedule-wipe-today>#</a></h2><p>Key modifications:</p><ol><li>Just added the Lighthouse location. The lighthouse at Cape Dalniy was an important strategic object on the way to Tarkov. The USEC headquarters operated during the Contract Wars. The old owners returned to Tarkov, who decided to stay and take their own orders.
This is the first Ireon of this location. Continually, the area will be expanded and be expanded.</li><li>The Lighthouse location will feature the new AI-type ex-USEC operatives, also called Rogues. These are a gang of former PMCs who worked together previously. They’re well-armed, well trained, and use coordinated combat tactics. They’ve got similar interests as the Raiders but united around a military past.
Rogue USEPs took over water treatment equipment and threw everything out there. Security cameras and gunmen are installed on the perimeter. In addition, several fighters patrol the perimeter, and a number of machines and missile launchers are available around the clock. When enemy is detected, or when enemy presence occurs, the guards open suppressive fire that will try to prevent enemy from coming to their homeland.
These new bots will not be lenient to the USEC PMC faction. A USEC player won’t open fire until he attempts to enter territory. If the player gets too close, he will receive an order to leave immediately and then is shot if not with respect. If a USEC player joins a group with a BEAR PMC, both of them will be considered hostile and attacked on sight without warning.
If a player does encounter a remark with the Rogues, he will be considered a traitor and dealt with in the next few raids as hostile.
3.Inertia has been added to the game so that it can play more realistic actions and move. Inertia is manifested in the following situation:</li></ol><p>Walking and strafing was a dangerous way of transporting you to the same destination. sprinting When sprinting, sharp movements may turn faster. landing after jumping or falling from height. Leaning and stepping.</p><p>Inertial force depends on the weight of equipment and Strength skill level. The more your equipment weighs, the lower the strength it’s:</p><p>the longer it takes to accelerate at the start of movement (walk, strafe, sprint) for a while. the longer you get to slow down after you stop (walk, strafe, sprint); the longer it takes to slow and accelerate, when moving from the opposite direction; the more movement speed falls while cruising. the higher speed of movement and the longer speed of movement decreases when landing after a jump or falls from a height; The longer it takes to lean, back to normal position and to sidestep.</p><p>The inertial force rises from 0 kg to 9kg for characters with Strength level and from 10 kg for those with the Elite Strength level. The inertial force becomes maximum, with 70 kg of equipment and 80 kg of equipment to suit the level 6 of the Strength section.
4. Expandedcrouching and growingmechanics. Now the length of these actions depends on the weight overtake. The number of changed positions and the number of new positions varies according to the extent of overload.
5. Expanded theweapon malfunctionsmechanics. Along with fires, weapons can now suffer from the following things:</p><p>If the cartridge isn’t ejectable, it’s blown and partially visible at the ejection port. The cause of this problem is, first, the technical condition of the weapon and, more often, the overheating and the cartridge characteristics. When an officer is trying to steal the weapon, he will be able to run through the cartridge. The main cause of this problem is the weapon magazine, especially those large capacity and high-diameter magazines. Other sources include cartridge characteristics, overheating of the weapon, and the technological condition of the weapon. After the bolt bolt gets jammed. Jamming can be both normal and hard. It’s only a matter of time that has been solved. The cause of the broken bolt can be just overheating the weapon or its technical condition. Hard grinding does not occur for the highest standard of the weapon.</p><p>A defect can only occur with old weapons (with a durable of 93%), except a defect caused by overheating.
Many types of weapons can’t be very well designed because of their construction or operation.
Now, you must first determine the type of work that is not appropriate for fixing the malfunction. In order to do that, you need to control the malfunctioning weapon, using a weapon inspection hotkey.
Characters with advanced levels of Troubleshooting will detect, whenever you do, the type of malfunction without having to inspect the weapon.
When the alarm goes off immediately, a light is pressed to record what happened. The messages and sounds can be disabled in the game’s settings by checking the Malfunction notification boxes.
6. The game features weaponsoverheating and related effects.
Weapons are hot after firing shots. The time of the gun is dependent on the cartridge, the barrel and the other heating-related elements of the weapon (receiver, muzzle devices, sandguards, etc.).
Unlike the heat, the weapon has gone to a very slow time. The cooling rate is, of course, dependent on the barrel and other cooling-related elements of the weapon (receivers, muzzle-watchers, handguards, etc.).
The degree of overheating can be monitored by the barcode and muzzle instruments. You may have a higher order of a few stages of overheating. A negative reaction to this stage comes from the stage a lot of overheating.</p><p>The weapon is prone to fire, but no redness of barrel and muzzles. Resonance: Heat of the tanks, muzzle devices and handguard is visible in thermal scopes, if he has an heat haze, or if a damage is found at the barrel or muzzle devices. the gun’s reddening medium is enough, so the gun’s redness is visible. Effects: The accuracy of weapons decreases, the failure chance increases, the wear decreases, and the maximum strength of weapons decreased during firing. The gun is very heavy, the barrel and the muzzle guns are very hot. The reaction rate of fire is adjusted, there’s a possible cooking-off possibility. Once the metal temperature is reached, a malfunction occurs and the bolt is damaged.</p><ol start=7><li>I improved my ammoballistics by applying extra magnetic instruments. As far as the flow and the energy is concerned, the initial speed, liar weight, diameter, and its shape and ballistic coefficients are in consideration now. The speed and the weight of the first weapon were not forgotten a time.
Through that, a complete communication can be achieved with real-time data. Aside from the loss of damage, the difference in the velocity and speed of the bullet was corrected. For example, on an angle of 5 439 m, the damage decreased from 20% to 20% when the barrel was changed for longer, thus increasing the speed of the damage, and the damage and penetrative abilities are also augmenting. However, it is worth a while to understand that for some ammunition there is no data in open sources, or they are incomplete. Such ammunition will be adjusted as needed data have been found.</li><li>The maneuvering of the gear was adjusted.</li></ol><p>Reduced a fixed recoil compensation when firing long bursts. lowered the skills of training and recoil reduction bonuses. general refinements and enhancements made in the weapon recoil system.</p><p>9.VOIP added voice communication to the system. The sound console is able to operate.
This feature allows us to negotiate and coordinate the negotiations.
Remember that using VOIP inappropriately can ruin your experience with other players.
Insults, playing music, clogging the air, and other behavior problems as well as the user’s own rules can also make it impossible for him to use the game account.</p><p>VOIP doesn’t work in tense mode, but instead in push-to-talk mode. Players can’t talk for more than 15 seconds in a row. It means that, every 20 seconds, when you scavenge, you can only speak for 15 seconds, regardless of whether it’s on the other hand.

The voice’s audibility depends on the distance of the speaker, as well as other audio modifiers. Room partitions, floors, walls, active headphones, lowered visor etc. Scavs can annoy the players to speak. VOIP can easily be removed from the gesture menu or via the hotkey. The Push-to-Talk Hotkey can be resold in control settings.</p><ol start=10><li>Expanded theOperational Tasks.</li></ol><p>Added the description variety to all types of operational tasks.

I’ve got several fixes:
Some weapons were modified (and improved), but also had new features.
They removed the ability to pounce grenades quickly. When you press the hotkey, your character takes a random grenade into his hands from your chest, rig or pocket.
To create the Hellostu, I created a new recipe for the Hideout.
Changed the threshold for re-installation.
All keys now hold durability (100 units, except that keys already have durability).
There were other ways to get started like bots and player Scavs.
Various balancing changes for rarity and spawn locations for items.
Changes and fixes to various weapons and attachments that are different.
There are many changes in the trader’s catalogue of goods.
Many fixes and improvements in localization.
Ensuring more complex tasks, balances.

ShowToc: true
date: &ldquo;2022-12-17&rdquo;
author: &ldquo;Guadalupe Crum&rdquo;</h2><p>This is an update of some sort, but not only to add new locations like the Lighthouse, but also a server wipe. The mechanics of the games have been changed, too. The maintenance starts, so the game is going to be down for next few hours. Until then, you can take a look at the patch notes below.</p><h4 id=escape-from-tarkov-action-gameplay-trailer-1>Escape from Tarkov action gameplay trailer.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#escape-from-tarkov-action-gameplay-trailer-1>#</a></h4><p>BridTV2994Escape from Tarkov Action Gameplay Trailer815851815851center26546.</p><h2 id=escape-from-tarkov-update-01212-notes-for-patch-maintenance-schedule-wipe-today-1>Escape From Tarkov Update 0.12.12 Notes for Patch, maintenance schedule, Wipe Today.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#escape-from-tarkov-update-01212-notes-for-patch-maintenance-schedule-wipe-today-1>#</a></h2><p>Key modifications:</p><ol><li>Just added the Lighthouse location. The lighthouse at Cape Dalniy was an important strategic object on the way to Tarkov. The USEC headquarters operated during the Contract Wars. The old owners returned to Tarkov, who decided to stay and take their own orders.
This is the first Ireon of this location. Continually, the area will be expanded and be expanded.</li><li>The Lighthouse location will feature the new AI-type ex-USEC operatives, also called Rogues. These are a gang of former PMCs who worked together previously. They’re well-armed, well trained, and use coordinated combat tactics. They’ve got similar interests as the Raiders but united around a military past.
Rogue USEPs took over water treatment equipment and threw everything out there. Security cameras and gunmen are installed on the perimeter. In addition, several fighters patrol the perimeter, and a number of machines and missile launchers are available around the clock. When enemy is detected, or when enemy presence occurs, the guards open suppressive fire that will try to prevent enemy from coming to their homeland.
These new bots will not be lenient to the USEC PMC faction. A USEC player won’t open fire until he attempts to enter territory. If the player gets too close, he will receive an order to leave immediately and then is shot if not with respect. If a USEC player joins a group with a BEAR PMC, both of them will be considered hostile and attacked on sight without warning.
If a player does encounter a remark with the Rogues, he will be considered a traitor and dealt with in the next few raids as hostile.
3.Inertia has been added to the game so that it can play more realistic actions and move. Inertia is manifested in the following situation:</li></ol><p>Walking and strafing was a dangerous way of transporting you to the same destination. sprinting When sprinting, sharp movements may turn faster. landing after jumping or falling from height. Leaning and stepping.</p><p>Inertial force depends on the weight of equipment and Strength skill level. The more your equipment weighs, the lower the strength it’s:</p><p>the longer it takes to accelerate at the start of movement (walk, strafe, sprint) for a while. the longer you get to slow down after you stop (walk, strafe, sprint); the longer it takes to slow and accelerate, when moving from the opposite direction; the more movement speed falls while cruising. the higher speed of movement and the longer speed of movement decreases when landing after a jump or falls from a height; The longer it takes to lean, back to normal position and to sidestep.</p><p>The inertial force rises from 0 kg to 9kg for characters with Strength level and from 10 kg for those with the Elite Strength level. The inertial force becomes maximum, with 70 kg of equipment and 80 kg of equipment to suit the level 6 of the Strength section.
4. Expandedcrouching and growingmechanics. Now the length of these actions depends on the weight overtake. The number of changed positions and the number of new positions varies according to the extent of overload.
5. Expanded theweapon malfunctionsmechanics. Along with fires, weapons can now suffer from the following things:</p><p>If the cartridge isn’t ejectable, it’s blown and partially visible at the ejection port. The cause of this problem is, first, the technical condition of the weapon and, more often, the overheating and the cartridge characteristics. When an officer is trying to steal the weapon, he will be able to run through the cartridge. The main cause of this problem is the weapon magazine, especially those large capacity and high-diameter magazines. Other sources include cartridge characteristics, overheating of the weapon, and the technological condition of the weapon. After the bolt bolt gets jammed. Jamming can be both normal and hard. It’s only a matter of time that has been solved. The cause of the broken bolt can be just overheating the weapon or its technical condition. Hard grinding does not occur for the highest standard of the weapon.</p><p>A defect can only occur with old weapons (with a durable of 93%), except a defect caused by overheating.
Many types of weapons can’t be very well designed because of their construction or operation.
Now, you must first determine the type of work that is not appropriate for fixing the malfunction. In order to do that, you need to control the malfunctioning weapon, using a weapon inspection hotkey.
Characters with advanced levels of Troubleshooting will detect, whenever you do, the type of malfunction without having to inspect the weapon.
When the alarm goes off immediately, a light is pressed to record what happened. The messages and sounds can be disabled in the game’s settings by checking the Malfunction notification boxes.
6. The game features weaponsoverheating and related effects.
Weapons are hot after firing shots. The time of the gun is dependent on the cartridge, the barrel and the other heating-related elements of the weapon (receiver, muzzle devices, sandguards, etc.).
Unlike the heat, the weapon has gone to a very slow time. The cooling rate is, of course, dependent on the barrel and other cooling-related elements of the weapon (receivers, muzzle-watchers, handguards, etc.).
The degree of overheating can be monitored by the barcode and muzzle instruments. You may have a higher order of a few stages of overheating. A negative reaction to this stage comes from the stage a lot of overheating.</p><p>The weapon is prone to fire, but no redness of barrel and muzzles. Resonance: Heat of the tanks, muzzle devices and handguard is visible in thermal scopes, if he has an heat haze, or if a damage is found at the barrel or muzzle devices. the gun’s reddening medium is enough, so the gun’s redness is visible. Effects: The accuracy of weapons decreases, the failure chance increases, the wear decreases, and the maximum strength of weapons decreased during firing. The gun is very heavy, the barrel and the muzzle guns are very hot. The reaction rate of fire is adjusted, there’s a possible cooking-off possibility. Once the metal temperature is reached, a malfunction occurs and the bolt is damaged.</p><ol start=7><li>I improved my ammoballistics by applying extra magnetic instruments. As far as the flow and the energy is concerned, the initial speed, liar weight, diameter, and its shape and ballistic coefficients are in consideration now. The speed and the weight of the first weapon were not forgotten a time.
Through that, a complete communication can be achieved with real-time data. Aside from the loss of damage, the difference in the velocity and speed of the bullet was corrected. For example, on an angle of 5 439 m, the damage decreased from 20% to 20% when the barrel was changed for longer, thus increasing the speed of the damage, and the damage and penetrative abilities are also augmenting. However, it is worth a while to understand that for some ammunition there is no data in open sources, or they are incomplete. Such ammunition will be adjusted as needed data have been found.</li><li>The maneuvering of the gear was adjusted.</li></ol><p>Reduced a fixed recoil compensation when firing long bursts. lowered the skills of training and recoil reduction bonuses. general refinements and enhancements made in the weapon recoil system.</p><p>9.VOIP added voice communication to the system. The sound console is able to operate.
This feature allows us to negotiate and coordinate the negotiations.
Remember that using VOIP inappropriately can ruin your experience with other players.
Insults, playing music, clogging the air, and other behavior problems as well as the user’s own rules can also make it impossible for him to use the game account.</p><p>VOIP doesn’t work in tense mode, but instead in push-to-talk mode. Players can’t talk for more than 15 seconds in a row. It means that, every 20 seconds, when you scavenge, you can only speak for 15 seconds, regardless of whether it’s on the other hand. A very short time out will occur if you press the Push button regularly. Reports suggest the obnoxious usage of VoIP. To do this, go to the gesture menu and press the report button while the other player talks or talks two seconds ago. You can’t report members of your group. The voice’s audibility depends on the distance of the speaker, as well as other audio modifiers. Room partitions, floors, walls, active headphones, lowered visor etc. Scavs can annoy the players to speak. VOIP can easily be removed from the gesture menu or via the hotkey. The Push-to-Talk Hotkey can be resold in control settings.</p><ol start=10><li>Expanded theOperational Tasks.</li></ol><p>Added the description variety to all types of operational tasks. Added stats to the player’s game. Added the exit to the specific extract condition, to the exit the location type tasks.</p><ol start=11><li>Added the ability to partly use different types of food and beverages.</li></ol><p>The effect is less than the amount consumed. The strength and the delay before the buff begins don’t change. The buffs are the only ones that count up to the original buffs value. Negative buffs don’t make up their original value. Negative buffs take into account skills (so the skill that relates to Metabolism, which helps reduce the duration of negative effects up to 50%). Negative buffs take advantage of their ability to attain the most of Metabolism. 12. New things were added: New weapons New weapon parts are added. There are 4 new handgun grenades (yet impact grenades). New equipment New items include furters. New keys New storage cases (Injector case and keycard holder) have been added. Rangefinders are a manual rangefinder and a tactical rangefinder module. Five new cartridges are available. New clothing kits for USEC and BEAR are being made for us. The new single-seat, but unique handbags have emerged. At the start of the game, new faces for both factions will have new faces.</p><ol start=13><li>More quests were added at the Lighthouse location.
Graphics and optimisations are changing and optimizing.
1.Screen Space Reflection is an effect of reflection from wet or glossy surfaces or water surfaces. The technology was completely redesigned and now the reflections look more realistic, while the load on the system is noticeablely reduced.</li><li>Added optimization for vegetation rendering in long distances. It helped us reduce CPU on large trees and other vegetation.</li><li>Add optimization of physical collision objects.</li><li>Added various optimizations in the server.</li><li>SSR is now enabled by default in High and Ultra graphics presets.</li><li>The picture now looks more vivid if the weather doesn’t beat the desaturation effect at all.
List of fixeds:</li><li>Fixed the issue where traders only restock times were not updated until the client was restarted.</li><li>In the cartridge case had the trigger when he moved the flashlight to another scandal.</li><li>Fixed the problem that caused Error 500 when interacting with the In-Game Location Map item – when it was insured – after it was resolved.</li><li>Fixed a problem resulting in the uninsufficient lighting in the Hout.</li><li>A problem arises, where bots could shoot through the factory’s walls.</li><li>Correct an issue with weapons inspecting Saiga-12 and SVDS.</li><li>Fixed the problem of overlapping sounds on the stairs in the 3-story dorm on the customs.</li><li>The problem was that bots instantly could move to a crouched position.</li><li>Fixed issue where I couldn’t create a stack of currencies or cartridges from 10 pieces.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a player can open a locked door without a key, using the Breach option from around the corner.</li><li>A player has fixed an issue where he can move from a prone position to a standing position if he does not change his stance during weaponloading.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a lack of water filter resources could continue to decrease after the final phase of production of purified water.</li><li>Fixed an issue when an expired offer on Flea Market disappeared from the My offer section in the early hours of the year.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the eye protection effect of the Gorilla welding mask was not counted.</li><li>Fixed an issue where stationary running animation played when leaning in a prone position.</li><li>Fixed a problem where, after the Flea Market search, only one part was revealed when the cheapest one-dimensional assembly was achieved.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a stock exchanger would lose value after the timer ended.</li><li>Fixed an issue in which the first message appeared when I entered the Hideout.</li><li>This case resolved where more bots spawned than needed in offline mode.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the older pants can disappear from BEAR.</li><li>This case saw an issue where a stifling polygon could be found in the Hideouts shooting range.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Glukhars guard bot wouldn’t shoot at players, even if the player still had ammo.</li><li>The first test rifle of the enemy was almost stolen.</li><li>You corrected the confusion and condition of the progress indicator of loading/unloading cartridges in the magazine.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a click sound can play after two firings of a pistol without a silenced rifle.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the level of operations was saved after a profile reset.</li><li>The problem was fixed on the way to the sound of the cleft of a hotel, where one could hear the sound of a window opening on the floor in the health resort.</li><li>Fixed a problem where the amount of water that went to a boil arose after the water poured.</li><li>Some sound problems can be resolved with regards to overlaps.</li><li>Several issues causing the error 228.</li><li>There were several glitches that causing game crashes.
I’ve got several fixes:
Some weapons were modified (and improved), but also had new features.
They removed the ability to pounce grenades quickly. When you press the hotkey, your character takes a random grenade into his hands from your chest, rig or pocket.
To create the Hellostu, I created a new recipe for the Hideout.
Changed the threshold for re-installation.
All keys now hold durability (100 units, except that keys already have durability).
There were other ways to get started like bots and player Scavs.
Various balancing changes for rarity and spawn locations for items.
Changes and fixes to various weapons and attachments that are different.
There are many changes in the trader’s catalogue of goods.
Many fixes and improvements in localization.
Ensuring more complex tasks, balances.
