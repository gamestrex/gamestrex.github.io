Here is a little more information about each app, as well as an easy download link. The Google Play Store listed all download links. It’s always recommended to download apps from Google Play or the app store.\nGoogle Santa Tracker. To download: Free. How much does he buy into a store? Size 8.9MB. Search Results: 4 stars of 5 compared to Google.\nIf you’re looking for a great Santa-Tracking application, look no further. Google’s Santa Tracker is the best app that’s available, at least in our humble opinion. The app didn’t update for 2020 when it was written, but it is going to be in the early stages. As the years pass, this app has got better and becomes better. And on the Play Store, it is always better to say that. Apparently, it’s not a simple Santa-tracking app. There are various games and other content you may be interested in. This app is well-suited for Googles eye-catching design. This app looks interesting and upbeat, and it’s so easy to use. You have a good, but we haven’t dealt with any problems with its performance in the short period we have used it. That happened in last year, and we always know. Like we said already, this app comes with a variety of games that you can play. You can play with elves in jetpacks or ride on boat-straps powered by rockets. You can even design your own elf in this application if you want. When the 24th of December comes to a close, the Christmas tree and the reindeer deliver presents in all kinds of directions. Google did its best to offer content with this app before December 24 so feel free to put them in and see what they’re up to. You can download the Google Santa Tracker.\nChristmas Tree Live Wallpaper. Get Price: Free to download. Purchases from an app: No cash. Size 9,6 MB. Google Play rating of 4.9 out of 5 stars.\nWhy don’t you use the wallpaper? It’s better than ever, how about using a cartoon wallpaper? OK, to be certain, there are several good Christmas live wallpaper apps on the Play Store. We tried them out and we picked our favorite one. This is probably the most popular Christmas live wallpaper app in the Play Store, but it’s sure to be the most popular one. The Google Play Store rating is valid and is for a good reason. This app currently has a rating of 4,9-stars in the Play Store. We couldn’t use that app. If you’d like to give this an app a second glance, you can show a beautiful animated wallpaper on the phone. There’s only one scene available, but you can tweak that scene according to your liking. If you look at the image above, you can see exactly what it is all about. You’ll get a beautiful winter landscape, with a tree full of Christmas lights on your walls. This live wallpaper comes with traditional Christmas music and a small city in the background. You can add the strength of snowfall, snowflake speed, and snowway. Apart from that, you can also take control of Christmas lights and fireworks. This is one of the prettiest Christmas landscapes I saw in general. The fact that it was animated is just another big plus. Christmas Live Wallpaper is free!\nChristmas bells 2019 – 2019 – will be available on. Price: Free to download. In-app purchases: No need for a purchase. Size 11MB. Google Play scores 4,9 out of 5 stars.\nIf you want to move slightly, and that can be done for Christmas. Even if you don’t know how to get a proper wallpaper on your phone, it’s really well and everything is working. Well, thanks to you, there’s a special app on Play Store only for that reason. Christmas Ringtones 2019 app is free to download, and is loaded with some Christmas-inspired ringtones that you can choose from. Install this app, you will find hundreds of Christmas ringtones. Yes, you read it, hundreds. You can always install Zedge instead, and get Christmas ringtones that way, but this app is entirely based on Christmas, which isn’t a compare of Zedge and other similar apps. You can view a ringtone from this app and for example, you can download it from your phone and set them in your hands. There are various songs there: Carol of the Bells, Drummer Boy, Joy to the World, O Holy Night, Deck the Halls, Christmas Tree, Dreaming of a white Christmas, and many more. Since there are hundreds of new ringtones yet available in this app, many still get on the line. It’s completely free, but it does come with ads. Please remember that. Download Christmas Ringtones 2019 Downloads from around the world.\nChristmas Photo Frames, Paints and… Cards Art. Price: You can download the package for free. Purchases: $0.99-$4.99. Size: 23Mo. Google Play rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars.\nNow, when you’re planning a Christmas gift or just something like that, that’s a great app. By using the collection of Christmas photo frames, effects \u0026 cards, you can edit your original or current pictures and decorate them with Christmas decorations. Of course you could take Christmas-themed pictures and only edit them, which is an even better option. If you don’t have one of these, this app provides you with a ton of content to bring pretty much every picture into Christmas. This app layout is awesome. With every option being fairly accessible, you won’t have to sort through menus to get to a specific option. There are over 50 templates to develop in this application. If you apply a template and the app processes your picture, you’ll get access to your text as well. This app is significantly different to that used in other similar apps – it is most effective for you. You can simply choose a template, and in doing this, you don’t have to apply one sticker at a time, and anything of that kind. This app offers very interesting and well-designed frames that you could use. You can even add fireworks and garlands to the card. That’s really a great app, I really recommend it to make Christmas cards. Download Christmas Photo Frames, Effects \u0026 Cards Art.\nChristmas Countdown Are you planning to arrive in Christmas? How are you or your child? In the Play Store, there’s a pretty good Christmas countdown app. When you open this app, you’ll get a Christmas countdown clock. This is not just your regular countdown clock, its well-decorated, its all snowy and nothing. On the flip side, you may choose something that combines well-designed themes, regardless if you want to get more info about the kids, Santa or something else. Even though this app isn’t all about countingdown clock, it isn’t that simple. It also comes with Christmas songs including Deck the Halls and We Wish You Merry Christmas. No ads are included in this application, so you can enjoy it with ease. And, you’ll get the chance to open a new gift every day of December in this app, on your advent calendar. You’ll find a beautiful Christmas themed image in high resolution, you can use as wallpaper. There is a high-quality option here now. You can upgrade to the Premium version of this app so you can get two countdown widgets, and by the side, you can also follow along on your mobile phone. The Premium App also includes some more Christmas songs, like Jingle Bells, and Silent Night, without any mention of having a lot of different customization options. Download Christmas Countdown.\nChristmas presents list. Pricing: Free to download. Get in advance: $0.99. Size: A minivan with a device. Google Play rating: 4,7 out of 5 stars.\nIt’s essential to buy presents for Christmas. Many of you are probably planning on buying them for your loved ones, some more, some less. Planning those purchases can cause headaches for some, but not everyone likes going shopping. That Christmas gift list app may give you a lot of comfort. This app name is somewhat self-declaratory but may help you organize your Christmas gift ideas and shopping. There are three different lists for each person. You can also add a Christmas-avatar to them. For example, you can make an entry for your dad by clicking the ”Last Claus’ on the app and a entry for your older brother by clicking on the ‘Snowman’. In each of those entries you enter gift ideas in any category irrespective of the number of ideas you have. To add, you can also list prices for those gifts, so you have a nice understanding of what youre looking for a personal gift. You can even add photos of specific gifts, if you wish, and then mark the ones you have already bought. The app has a variety of currencies and languages, while you can even set the Christmas shopping budget for yourself, so you don’t cross it. This app seems to be pretty nice. It’s simple and elegant, and, a sure choice, a Christmas gift-reading machine. This app has been around for a long time now. It’s less useful than a regular note-taking application. Download the Christmas Gift List!\nChristmas Songs The price: Free to download. Purchase in advance: No refund. Weight 75MB. Google Play rating: 4,4 out of 5 stars.\nChristmas isn’t actually complete without proper Christmas songs, right? If you agree with the statement, you’ll have some Christmas music at the door. This application, called Christmas Songs, focused on providing you some Christmas-y tunes. These gifts come with fifty Christmas songs, which are most popular among you. There’s an unnamed part of this application, as it’s well-known. I’m not counting the songs here. You’re here : Ave Maria, Blue Christmas, Feliz Navidad, Hallelujah, Happy Xmas (War is Over), there’s the Santa Claus, Jingle Bell Rock, Last Christmas, Holy Night, Rockin Around The Christmas Tree and many more. This is only to give you an idea about what to expect from this application in terms of content. The mobile app doesn’t really have an eye-catching design, but considering its content, we can ignore it. You may play these Christmas tunes with a built-in music player, and you can play it both online or offline. For each song on this list, you’ll find more lyrics and, if you don’t, go caroling. By the way, this player will automatically play the next song on the list. Apps are free, but with ads. Download Christmas songs.\nChristmas Wallpapers in 4K on the Christmas Wall. Price: Free to download. Purchase in-app: No. Approximately 6 o’clock. Google Play rating: 4,1 out of 5 stars.\nAre you still looking for quality Christmas wallpapers? I know this is my goal, but I don’t give it anything. A screenprinter (Twiss) is available on the Play Store. It is focused in the exclusive theme of Christmas. Wallpapers that are included in this application are in 4K resolution, so you don’t have to worry about a lack of quality content. You can set a screen with just one click, if you want. You can get some wallpapers freely, if you don’t like them as much as they are. There are many wallpapers available in this app, but we have not yet got the exact number. The new wallpaper is constantly updating; however, it can be worth keeping this app around until Christmas at the best time. You can share the wallpapers you like with the app, and without downloading them. Even saving wallpaper for your mobile phones is optional. You can also select those favorites: if you tap the favorite icon on a specific wallpaper, the wallpaper will be saved on the side of your screen, but there will be no other way of the app. If you like to take a look at the various Android wallpapers for Christmas, this is the app for you. Download Christmas Wallpapers in 4K version.\nChristmas Radio Price: You have the money, you can download and download. Buying books: No taxes. 5 ml? Google Play ratings: 4,4 out of five stars.\nMany of you still like listening to the radio. In other words, what better way to get into Christmas with listening to a Christmas-y content? There is an app called Christmas Radio in the Play Store, which allows you to stream a Christmas radio. There are many stations on the list, such as 181FM Christmas Mix and Xmas in Frisko: SomaFM, The Christmas Lounge, Rocks! This radio can turn around the noise even if it is not on the app. If the app is running in the background, you can use your phone still without problems. You can even turn the display off, and this app will continue streaming, but be aware that you could lose your phone in the background. The stream of live streaming is usually more battery-heavy than your phone would like, so it’s tending to destroy such apps. If there’s a stop, the streaming is usually too slow. You can take a few steps to prevent this, of course. You can open this app in one way or the other. It depends on where the phone is, and how many software is installed on it. This app looks nice, it’s very easy to use, and it’s free to use. Please note that you’re not seeing advertisements on a regular basis. Download Christmas Radio.\nMerry Christmas, thanks for a little photo stick! Price: Download free. For example, when you buy items, you might save $0.99. Size 8.8 mm x 7.8 mm x 9.8 mm x 16.3 mm x 8.8 mm x 10.8 mm x 10.8 m x 8.3 m x 3.7 x 5.7 m x 5.8 x 10 6/8 x 6.5 x 6.5 x 7/8 oz. Google Play 4.5 out of five stars.\nMerry Christmas Photo Stickers is yet another app full of a sense of purpose. This app is used to mimic Christmas pictures. Think of this as an app that is filled with really fun stickers; however, these are all Christmas cards. There is no distraction whatsoever, so please grab Christmas sticker! The application is free to download and use, while there is a single offer for it. That’s going to help you remove ads. But it’s basically it. This app can help you make postcards or just pictures for your social media accounts. There are a lot of stickers, including Christmas trees, ribbons, showmen, stars, lights and decoration, show / winter layers, happy wishes texts, and even some photo frames. This application isn’t exactly the most modern, but it’s not something that should bother you. We have the UI to allow you to choose the image, and select a sticker, if you use it that way. The application is free and ready to take a break for Christmas! Download Merry Christmas Photo Stickers.\n","wordCount":"2656","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-18T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sharon Floyd"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/the-top-10-best-christmas-android-apps-updated-december-2021/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>The Top 10 Best Christmas Android Apps Updated December 2021</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 18, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2656 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Sharon Floyd</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#christmas-apps-are-the-top-2021-best>Christmas apps are the top 2021 best.</a></li><li><a href=#christmas-android-apps-2021-downloads-the-top-10-best-christmas-android-apps-2021>Christmas Android apps 2021 downloads the top 10 best Christmas Android apps 2021.</a></li><li><a href=#google-santa-tracker>Google Santa Tracker.</a></li><li><a href=#heading></a></li><li><a href=#heading-1></a></li><li><a href=#christmas-tree-live-wallpaper>Christmas Tree Live Wallpaper.</a></li><li><a href=#christmas-bells-2019--2019--will-be-available-on>Christmas bells 2019 – 2019 – will be available on.</a></li><li><a href=#christmas-photo-frames-paints-and-cards-art>Christmas Photo Frames, Paints and… Cards Art.</a></li><li><a href=#christmas-countdown>Christmas Countdown</a></li><li><a href=#christmas-presents-list>Christmas presents list.</a></li><li><a href=#christmas-songs>Christmas Songs</a></li><li><a href=#christmas-wallpapers-in-4k-on-the-christmas-wall>Christmas Wallpapers in 4K on the Christmas Wall.</a></li><li><a href=#christmas-radio>Christmas Radio</a></li><li><a href=#merry-christmas-thanks-for-a-little-photo-stick>Merry Christmas, thanks for a little photo stick!</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>We saw the Play Store for a few Christmas-themed applications for you.

This is probably the most popular Christmas live wallpaper app in the Play Store, but it’s sure to be the most popular one.
The Google Play Store rating is valid and is for a good reason. This app currently has a rating of 4,9-stars in the Play Store. We couldn’t use that app. If you’d like to give this an app a second glance, you can show a beautiful animated wallpaper on the phone. There’s only one scene available, but you can tweak that scene according to your liking.
If you look at the image above, you can see exactly what it is all about. You’ll get a beautiful winter landscape, with a tree full of Christmas lights on your walls. This live wallpaper comes with traditional Christmas music and a small city in the background. You can add the strength of snowfall, snowflake speed, and snowway. Apart from that, you can also take control of Christmas lights and fireworks. This is one of the prettiest Christmas landscapes I saw in general. The fact that it was animated is just another big plus.
Christmas Live Wallpaper is free!</p><h2 id=christmas-bells-2019--2019--will-be-available-on>Christmas bells 2019 – 2019 – will be available on.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#christmas-bells-2019--2019--will-be-available-on>#</a></h2><p>Price: Free to download.

Even if you don’t know how to get a proper wallpaper on your phone, it’s really well and everything is working. Well, thanks to you, there’s a special app on Play Store only for that reason. Christmas Ringtones 2019 app is free to download, and is loaded with some Christmas-inspired ringtones that you can choose from.
Install this app, you will find hundreds of Christmas ringtones. Yes, you read it, hundreds. You can always install Zedge instead, and get Christmas ringtones that way, but this app is entirely based on Christmas, which isn’t a compare of Zedge and other similar apps. You can view a ringtone from this app and for example, you can download it from your phone and set them in your hands.
There are various songs there: Carol of the Bells, Drummer Boy, Joy to the World, O Holy Night, Deck the Halls, Christmas Tree, Dreaming of a white Christmas, and many more. Since there are hundreds of new ringtones yet available in this app, many still get on the line. It’s completely free, but it does come with ads. Please remember that.

Google Play rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars.</p><p>Now, when you’re planning a Christmas gift or just something like that, that’s a great app. By using the collection of Christmas photo frames, effects & cards, you can edit your original or current pictures and decorate them with Christmas decorations. Of course you could take Christmas-themed pictures and only edit them, which is an even better option. If you don’t have one of these, this app provides you with a ton of content to bring pretty much every picture into Christmas.
This app layout is awesome. With every option being fairly accessible, you won’t have to sort through menus to get to a specific option. There are over 50 templates to develop in this application. If you apply a template and the app processes your picture, you’ll get access to your text as well. This app is significantly different to that used in other similar apps – it is most effective for you. You can simply choose a template, and in doing this, you don’t have to apply one sticker at a time, and anything of that kind.
This app offers very interesting and well-designed frames that you could use. You can even add fireworks and garlands to the card. That’s really a great app, I really recommend it to make Christmas cards.

How are you or your child? In the Play Store, there’s a pretty good Christmas countdown app. When you open this app, you’ll get a Christmas countdown clock. This is not just your regular countdown clock, its well-decorated, its all snowy and nothing. On the flip side, you may choose something that combines well-designed themes, regardless if you want to get more info about the kids, Santa or something else.
Even though this app isn’t all about countingdown clock, it isn’t that simple. It also comes with Christmas songs including Deck the Halls and We Wish You Merry Christmas. No ads are included in this application, so you can enjoy it with ease. And, you’ll get the chance to open a new gift every day of December in this app, on your advent calendar. You’ll find a beautiful Christmas themed image in high resolution, you can use as wallpaper.
There is a high-quality option here now. You can upgrade to the Premium version of this app so you can get two countdown widgets, and by the side, you can also follow along on your mobile phone. The Premium App also includes some more Christmas songs, like Jingle Bells, and Silent Night, without any mention of having a lot of different customization options.

Get in advance: $0.99. Size: A minivan with a device. Google Play rating: 4,7 out of 5 stars.</p><p>It’s essential to buy presents for Christmas. Many of you are probably planning on buying them for your loved ones, some more, some less. Planning those purchases can cause headaches for some, but not everyone likes going shopping. That Christmas gift list app may give you a lot of comfort. This app name is somewhat self-declaratory but may help you organize your Christmas gift ideas and shopping.
There are three different lists for each person. You can also add a Christmas-avatar to them. For example, you can make an entry for your dad by clicking the ”Last Claus’ on the app and a entry for your older brother by clicking on the ‘Snowman’. In each of those entries you enter gift ideas in any category irrespective of the number of ideas you have. To add, you can also list prices for those gifts, so you have a nice understanding of what youre looking for a personal gift.
You can even add photos of specific gifts, if you wish, and then mark the ones you have already bought. The app has a variety of currencies and languages, while you can even set the Christmas shopping budget for yourself, so you don’t cross it. This app seems to be pretty nice. It’s simple and elegant, and, a sure choice, a Christmas gift-reading machine. This app has been around for a long time now. It’s less useful than a regular note-taking application.

Purchase in advance: No refund. Weight 75MB. Google Play rating: 4,4 out of 5 stars.</p><p>Christmas isn’t actually complete without proper Christmas songs, right? If you agree with the statement, you’ll have some Christmas music at the door. This application, called Christmas Songs, focused on providing you some Christmas-y tunes. These gifts come with fifty Christmas songs, which are most popular among you. There’s an unnamed part of this application, as it’s well-known.
I’m not counting the songs here. You’re here : Ave Maria, Blue Christmas, Feliz Navidad, Hallelujah, Happy Xmas (War is Over), there’s the Santa Claus, Jingle Bell Rock, Last Christmas, Holy Night, Rockin Around The Christmas Tree and many more. This is only to give you an idea about what to expect from this application in terms of content.
The mobile app doesn’t really have an eye-catching design, but considering its content, we can ignore it. You may play these Christmas tunes with a built-in music player, and you can play it both online or offline. For each song on this list, you’ll find more lyrics and, if you don’t, go caroling. By the way, this player will automatically play the next song on the list. Apps are free, but with ads.

I know this is my goal, but I don’t give it anything. A screenprinter (Twiss) is available on the Play Store. It is focused in the exclusive theme of Christmas. Wallpapers that are included in this application are in 4K resolution, so you don’t have to worry about a lack of quality content.
You can set a screen with just one click, if you want. You can get some wallpapers freely, if you don’t like them as much as they are. There are many wallpapers available in this app, but we have not yet got the exact number. The new wallpaper is constantly updating; however, it can be worth keeping this app around until Christmas at the best time.
You can share the wallpapers you like with the app, and without downloading them. Even saving wallpaper for your mobile phones is optional. You can also select those favorites: if you tap the favorite icon on a specific wallpaper, the wallpaper will be saved on the side of your screen, but there will be no other way of the app. If you like to take a look at the various Android wallpapers for Christmas, this is the app for you.

Buying books: No taxes. 5 ml? Google Play ratings: 4,4 out of five stars.</p><p>Many of you still like listening to the radio. In other words, what better way to get into Christmas with listening to a Christmas-y content? There is an app called Christmas Radio in the Play Store, which allows you to stream a Christmas radio. There are many stations on the list, such as 181FM Christmas Mix and Xmas in Frisko: SomaFM, The Christmas Lounge, Rocks!
This radio can turn around the noise even if it is not on the app. If the app is running in the background, you can use your phone still without problems. You can even turn the display off, and this app will continue streaming, but be aware that you could lose your phone in the background. The stream of live streaming is usually more battery-heavy than your phone would like, so it’s tending to destroy such apps. If there’s a stop, the streaming is usually too slow.
You can take a few steps to prevent this, of course. You can open this app in one way or the other. It depends on where the phone is, and how many software is installed on it. This app looks nice, it’s very easy to use, and it’s free to use. Please note that you’re not seeing advertisements on a regular basis.

Google Play 4.5 out of five stars.</p><p>Merry Christmas Photo Stickers is yet another app full of a sense of purpose. This app is used to mimic Christmas pictures. Think of this as an app that is filled with really fun stickers; however, these are all Christmas cards. There is no distraction whatsoever, so please grab Christmas sticker!
The application is free to download and use, while there is a single offer for it. That’s going to help you remove ads. But it’s basically it. This app can help you make postcards or just pictures for your social media accounts. There are a lot of stickers, including Christmas trees, ribbons, showmen, stars, lights and decoration, show / winter layers, happy wishes texts, and even some photo frames.
This application isn’t exactly the most modern, but it’s not something that should bother you. We have the UI to allow you to choose the image, and select a sticker, if you use it that way. The application is free and ready to take a break for Christmas!
