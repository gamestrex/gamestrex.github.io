So, what’s going on here? Well, for the second time now, Activision has integrated Warzone 2.0 into the Modern Warfare 2 launcher, just as it did with Warzone and Modern Warfare (2019).

The download size is dependent on whether you already have Modern Warfare 2 installed, as those with the game will have a much smaller 2.51GB, while those downloading from scratch will have a larger 45GB download. As for Steam, Activision has confirmed that anyone with Modern Warfare 2 installed will have Warzone 2.0 already preloaded, while those who don’t have it installed can go ahead and download Warzone 2.0 on its own.

Still, for fans, this integration creates a wider feeling that Activision’s development resources are being pulled away from Modern Warfare 2 towards Warzone 2.0. The community has pointed out that only two maps have been announced for the game’s first season, both of which are recycled from previous games. The game’s first major patch also coincides with Warzone 2.0’s launch, raising questions on whether Modern Warfare 2’s development is determined by the development cycle of the battle royale mode.\n","wordCount":"749","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-21T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Eduardo Hughes"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/good-luck-figuring-out-how-to-download-warzone-2-0/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Good Luck Figuring Out How To Download Warzone 2 0</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-21 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 21, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;749 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Eduardo Hughes</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>On PlayStation 5, you&rsquo;ll find a promoted Warzone 2.0 tile which you can click on, taking you to a dedicated page for Modern Warfare 2, Warzone 2.0 and an upsell of Call of Duty Points.

ORIGINAL STORY 15/11/22:
Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 is now available to preload ahead of the game&rsquo;s release tomorrow - but doing so is anything but straightforward.
PlayStation 4 and 5 owners searching for Warzone 2.0 last night were unable to find the download by searching &ldquo;Call of Duty Warzone&rdquo; in the PlayStation Store, while Steam users who own Modern Warfare 2 found no download whatsoever.
