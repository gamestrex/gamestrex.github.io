A button will be revealed, step on it. Climb the stairs, use a bomb to make a hole. Drop in it & you will reach the central hall where you will encounter Turmos. Defeat him in the boss battle & finally when he is dead you will get the Emblem of Earth. Now return to the map & move towards the next island.</p><h3 id=return-to-hermits-island--tikarel>Return To Hermit’s Island & Tikarel<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#return-to-hermits-island--tikarel>#</a></h3><p>On Hermit’s Island, look for the shack in the center to find a note. In a letter, you are instructed to jump down the well to fetch a package left behind by his buddy Teppo the Archeologist. Make your way to the 4-way intersection point and you’ll find a locked door. Move towards the north to find a chest with a regular key. Use that key to unlock the door near the intersection and move past the 2nd intersection to retrieve a chest containing 5 bombs. For bonus again move to the north carrying a Cepede and you will be awarded a treasure chest. The chest offers a piece of heart. Keep progressing the game until you encounter a statue. Push it to unlock the door & you will be in the Room of Answers. You will come across another status that breathes fire. Wait for the flames to slow down, walk the hallways & you’ll score another treasure chest near a half wall. Using a bomb break the wall. You will find a chest with a regular key. With this key unlock a treasure chest to get the Lost Stone Cube of Archimedes. Use this and you’ll be quickly out of the well. Head back to the Tikarel only to find a girl waiting for you near the entrance. She will inform you about the Festival of Sun which is soon t begin & give you a regular key. With the key unlock the door, move inside the cave to collect a Toy soldier worth 20 coins. Exit the area and climb the hill to start the mini-boss battle. When you return to the boat after beating him, the Town Sheriff challenge is automatically achieved. To know the location of Gillfolk’s Drop & Southwind Isle interact with Neeti. Let the game guide you and in between, you will get lucky with several amazing items. In Crayfish Cave, blow-up crate puzzles & a chest containing 150 coins will be revealed. You’ll find a bottle with a note revealing the location of Reef. Make your way towards it, enter the abandoned house to get two treasure chests one with extra bombs and one with 50 coins. Exit & negotiate with the collector to receive a special gift at the cost of Bloodstones. Shoot the bull’s-eye with your bow and arrow, and a treasure chest opens to the northeast. However, you can’t unlock it yet so leave Tikarel and move to the next island in the Oceanhorn walkthrough, Gillfolk’s Drop.</p><h3 id=gillfolks-drop-and-honey-from-southwind-isle>Gillfolk’s Drop and Honey from Southwind Isle<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gillfolks-drop-and-honey-from-southwind-isle>#</a></h3><p>Sail through & enter the Gillfolk’s Drop. There you will find a bottle with a note revealing the Skerry’s location. To the north of the docks, you will get lucky with a treasure chest containing five coins. Exit the Gillfolk’s Drop and on your way visit Skerry. There you will collect the Bloodstone and 25 EXP from a treasure chest. Now make a trip to the Southwind Isle and collect more Bloodstone on the way. Let the game guide you and eventually, you will see a cave inside which there’s a man waiting for you. He is none other than your Honey supplier. He will reward you with ample honey for completing the Faith Of Honey Man mission. Return to Gillfork’s drop and hand the honey to the Gillman who is waiting for you near the Deep Cove. With this, he will give you a key to enter Deep Cove and a new challenge “Fruitti Di Terra” will be unlocked. Swim your way to Gillman’s royal palace, Emblem of Ocean awaits you there. Since the palace & princess are frozen only an item near Cavern of Fire will help you defreeze them. Hence, get one from the Olf Fortress. This takes you to part 6 Old Fortress Island and the Cavern of Fire.</p><h3 id=old-fortress-island-and-the-cavern-of-fire>Old Fortress Island and the Cavern of Fire<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#old-fortress-island-and-the-cavern-of-fire>#</a></h3><p>Go to the Western Watchover to get a chest with a regular key. Continue your journey with a key. While wandering further you will reach a split path. When you exit the split path you will locate a chest and rewarded with 150 coins. Go to the Direfolk’s hideouts in prison cells. Again you will encounter a chest with 20 coins. It’s time to get the master key. You will find it in a kitchen-themed area. Once you get the master key visit the next prisons and find a master key chest. Open the chest and you will earn a magic Ice Spell. When you return you will find two more chests one with 5 coins & another with 100 coins. Return to the Dove Cave only to make a trip to Cavern of Fire. Just when you enter you will get a heart refill. Use the magic ice Spell and break the mask of a fire-breathing enemy and finally kill him. While attempting to get another treasure chest containing a regular key you will find 2 chests with arrows. Collect them. Using the key open the locked door and there you will find a treasure chest offering fire spell. Well, this is the item from Cavern of Fire needed to defreeze the Royal palace & princess. Exit the Cavern of Fire and move on to part 7.</p><p>That concludes Part 1 – 6 of Ocean Walkthrough.
