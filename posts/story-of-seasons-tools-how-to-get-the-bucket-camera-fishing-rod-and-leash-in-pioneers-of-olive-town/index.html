On this page: How to get: These tools are:\nAxe Bucket Camera Fishing Rod Hammer Hoe Leash Sickle Watering Can\nYou’ll receive the Axe, Sickle and Hammer on your first day on the farm and then both the Hoe and the Watering Can on the second. The final four tools - the Bucket, Fishing Rod, Camera and Leash - all, however, require you either waiting for a specific day or talking to a certain member of Olive Town. All of your tools have a specific slot in the Tool Bag and they can be moved in or out of this bag into your main inventory whenever you choose. This means you can easily make room for a new item in your inventory by placing one of the tools you’re not currently using back into the Tool Bag. It also means you never have to quickly run home to grab a tool you’ve forgotten to pick up, because it’s already in your inventory. Each of the tools you can upgrade have five levels:\nThe base level you receive it at Iron Silver Gold Orichalcum\nEach upgrade requires a certain amount of money and materials, including different types of lumber and ingots. The Iron Sickle, for example, requires three Lumber and three Iron Ingots, while the Golden Axe, requires 10 Supple Lumber and 10 Gold Ingots. Once you’ve all the required materials and money, take them to the Tool Shop and your tool will be immediately updated.

The Bucket can be used to get rid of the puddles and the small ponds which will appear about your farm. Clearing the puddles will reward you with clay and the odd artifact, while emptying the ponds will reveal chests containing items like the Heavy Object, which can be appraised, transforming them into something useful, at the Olive Museum. When you first visit the Olive Museum during these opening hours, you’ll be treated to a cutscene with Gloria. She’ll give you the camera in exchange for you donating pictures of the local wildlife to the Olive Museum. Now you’ll be able to use the Camera to take pictures of whatever you like in Pioneers of Olive Town - animals, buildings, people, specific areas of a person… If you want to collect the wildlife photos for the Olive Museum, keep an eye out for wild animals, bugs and birds wandering about your farm and Olive Town itself. When you see one of these creatures, take out your camera and point your lens, making sure the animal is highlighted in blue to ensure they’re properly included in the picture. To find it, you need to visit Marcos’ house in Olive Town, which is located just on the edge of the beach. When you go inside Manuela will give you a Fishing Rod completely for free! Now you can use your Fishing Rod to catch various fish in any body of water you encounter, from the sea to the underground lakes. To do this you need to collect 20 Logs and have 2000G, before heading to the Carpenter’s Workshop where you’ll be able to upgrade your house. Somehow your new home will be built straight away and now all you have to do is visit the Animal Store, which is open from 8am to 6pm everyday but Tuesday. Upon entering, you’ll have a conversation with Patricia who will give you the Leash for free. To use it, however, you need to purchase a pet from Bridget, who stands at the right-hand corner within the Animal Store and is selling a variety of cats and dogs. Once you’ve purchased a pet, you can use the Leash to take them on a walk around your farm and Olive Town. The Leash will stay in effect even if you decide to use another tool, which means your pet will happily stand still as you complete farm work. To end the walk, simply interact with your pet again while the Leash is selected and they’ll return home.
