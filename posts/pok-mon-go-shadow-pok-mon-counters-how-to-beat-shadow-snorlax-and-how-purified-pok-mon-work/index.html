On this page: Update (July 25th): Shadow Pokémon have seen a few nerfs since release - specifically lowering their capture rate, and no longer becoming tradable (Purified Pokémon, however, still are). As well as looking different, it’ll behave differently too. Shadow Pokémon have the charge move Frustration, while the Candy and Stardust cost to power it up are tripled. So - how do you solve a a problem like a Shadow Pokémon? The answer - purify them, and having a Purified Pokémon offers a number of benefits that make the process worthwhile. More on that further in the article, but first - how do you get a Shadow Pokémon? You do this by defeating the Team Go Rocket that have invaded your local PokéStops. Once you have defeated a Team Go Rocket, they will abandon their Shadow Pokémon, allowing you to capture it in a similar way to how you capture defeated Raid Bosses. Check out our guide on Team Go Rocket for all the information you could ever want on this villainous team, but, for now, it’s time to purify your new Shadow Pokémon. First, you’ll want to find your chosen Shadow Pokémon in your Pokémon storage. Shadow Pokémon have a purple flame next to their picture, like how Shiny Pokémon have a set of silver stars. Once you’ve picked a Shadow Pokémon, you’ll discover that there is a new option available above ‘Power Up’ and ‘Evolve’ (if this Pokémon can evolve) - Purify. Purifying a Shadow Pokémon will cost a specific amount of Stardust and Candy depending on which Pokémon you want to Purify and how strong it is. A Squirtle, for example, will need 2,000 Stardust and 2 Squirtle Candy to be purified, while a Blastoise will require 5,000 Stardust and 5 Squirtle Candy. Select ‘Purify’ and then ‘Yes’ on the confirmation window to watch a cutscene of your Pokémon being cleansed of the evil that has invaded its heart, leaving you with a newly purified Pokémon.\nThe Candy cost for powering up or evolving the Pokémon will decrease by 10%. The Stardust cost to powering up or teaching the Pokémon a secondary move will decrease by 10%. The Purified Pokémon will learn Return - a 3 bar Normal type move, which is great for Normal type Pokémon. IVs will be increased by 2 in every stat - Attack, Defence, HP. Finally, a Purified Pokemon’s level will increase - the cap on this increase is level 25.\nThank you to ControvT from reddit for the help with this information. Purified Pokémon will have a blue star next to them in your Pokémon storage. Due to the Candy cost, it’s worth catching non-Shadow Pokémon as you play, so that you will be able to quickly purify Shadow Pokémon after you catch them. This will help you build up a strong collection of new Pokémon and level up your Purifier medal. Below you’ll find a complete list of all the currently released Shadow Pokémon in Pokémon Go - it will help you plan out your new catching regime!\nGeodude (can be evolved into Shadow Graveler and Golen) Latios Shinx (can be evolved into Shadow Luxio and Luxray) Patrat (can be evolved into Shadow Watchog) Purrloin (can be evolved into Shadow Liepard) Ducklett (can be evolved into Shadow Swanna) Foongus (can be evolved into Amoonguss)\nOn Wednesday, 25th May, the Shadow version of Alolan Marowak was released as part of the Alola to Alola event.

Below you’ll find a list of all the currently available Shadow Pokémon in Pokémon Go. We’ve also included the counters to help you defeat each Shadow Pokémon and the Team Go Rocket phrases, which hint at what Shadow Pokémon you’ll be facing. Currently, Shadow Snorlax is one of the hardest Shadow Pokémon available in Pokémon Go. Thanks to the evil infecting Shadow Snorlax, it has the ability to use fast Ghost and Psychic type moves as well as charged Normal, Ground and Steel moves. This means that Shadow Snorlax can’t be defeated by the Pokémon, such as Machamp, that would easily knock out a Normal type Pokémon. Here is a list of Pokémon, and the moves they can use, that would make an ideal team to take down a Shadow Snorlax or two:\nTyranitar - Ideal Moves: Smash Down / Crunch Ursaring - Ideal Moves: Counter / Close Combat Lucario - Ideal Moves: Counter / Power-Up Punch Weavile - Ideal Moves: Ice Shard / Avalanche Dragonite - Ideal Moves: Dragon Breath / Dragon Claw Metagross - Ideal Moves: Bullet Punch / Meteor Mash\nIf you’ve been lucky with the Legendaries, you could also call on them for help:\nLugia - Ideal Moves:Extrasensory / Sky Attack Latios - Ideal Moves: Dragon Breath / Dragon Claw Dialga - Ideal Moves: Dragon Breath / Dragon Claw Palkia - Ideal Moves: Dragon Breath / Dragon Meteor Heatran - Ideal Moves: Fire Spin / Stone Edge\nDon’t forget to use your shields to block any of Shadow Snorlax’s charged moves! Thank you to celandro from reddit for the help with this information. It’s unknown whether all of the following will be available in the game when the Purification mechanic releases, but at the very least, the following are in the game files and should appear at some point (thanks to martycochrane on reddit for helping with the following):\nKrabby (Gen 1) Kingler (Gen 1) Rhyhorn (Gen 1) Rhydon (Gen 1) Kangaskhan (Gen 1) Murkrow (Gen 2) Chimchar (Gen 4) Monferno (Gen 4) Infernape (Gen 4) Honchkrow (Gen 4) Gible (Gen 4) Gabite (Gen 4) Garchomp (Gen 4) Rhyperior (Gen 4)\nIn the spin-offs, there are far more Shadow Pokémon that what’s listed here - well over a hundred - which also include the Legendary Birds Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres, as well as Lugia. Pokkén Tournament also introduced Shadow Mewtwo - and it’ll be interesting to see whether the list of Pokémon Go Shadow creatures will be expanded over time. Elsewhere, it was also technically possible to get Shiny Shadow Pokémon - though it was mostly through a glitch that was later corrected with Pokémon XD. Chances are Pokémon Go’s Shadow Pokemon won’t be shiny as a result, but here’s a look at someone going through the process in Pokémon Coliseum if you’re interested: The Season of Mythical Wishes continues with the Winter Holiday event, which has brought Mega Glalie to Pokémon Go. Don’t forget to partake in the new Go Battle League season. Elsewhere, be sure to use Daily Adventure Incense for the chance of encountering Galarian Articuno, Galarian Zapdos and Galarian Moltres.\nPurified Pokemon can not be transferred to either Pokemon Let’s Go Pikachu or Pokemon Let’s Go Eevee. Purifying a fainted Shadow Pokemon will restore it to full health. A change several days after release meant Shadow Pokémon cannot be traded, though Purified Pokémon can. You can place Shadow Pokémon in a gym, which gives the gym a very spooky atmosphere when you visit. Purified Pokémon can also be put in gyms, but it doesn’t look as cool. Shadow Pokémon cannot undergo Mega Evolution. Want to celebrate catching a new Shadow Pokémon? Then take a photo of it with Pokémon Go’s AR mode! The Shadow Pokémon will be so happy that it you want to take its photo that it will lose its angry expression. Unlike Event or Legendary Pokémon, Purified Pokémon can be mass transferred - so be careful! When you purify a Shadow Pokémon the move Frustration will be replaced with Return. You can find a Lucky Shadow Pokémon, meaning you can also have a Lucky Purified Pokémon. Want to know how many Zubats you’ve purified? Then head to the PokéDex and look under the Zubat entry. Every possible Shadow Pokémon now has a Purified counter, alongside Seen, Caught and Lucky.\nWhile Shadow Pokémon are more powerful than regular Pokémon, the corruption infecting them eventually causes them to turn on their teammates. The only way to save Shadow Pokémon from this corruption is purify them. Purification return the Shadow Pokémon to normal, while also increasing their stats. Shadow Pokémon joined Pokémon Go alongside Team Go Rocket. The evil organisation are using the Shadow Pokémon to help them invade PokéStops. Team Go Rocket’s arrival was first teased after Pokémon Go Fest at Chicago in 2019. After the Fest had ended festival goers discovered that Grunts had photobombed the pictures they had taken with Pokémon Go’s AR photo mode. This photobombing continued at Pokémon Go Fest in Dortmund later than year. A Team Go Rocket hot air balloon was even spotted floating in the sky above the festival.\n","wordCount":"2524","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-14T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-14T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tony Muina"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/pok-mon-go-shadow-pok-mon-counters-how-to-beat-shadow-snorlax-and-how-purified-pok-mon-work/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Pok Mon Go Shadow Pok Mon Counters How To Beat Shadow Snorlax And How Purified Pok Mon Work</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 14, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2524 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Tony Muina</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>Originating from the Gamecube spin-off games - Pokémon Colosseum and Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness - Shadow Pokémon have had their hearts corrupted by evil.

Below you&rsquo;ll find a list of all the currently available Shadow Pokémon in Pokémon Go. We&rsquo;ve also included the counters to help you defeat each Shadow Pokémon and the Team Go Rocket phrases, which hint at what Shadow Pokémon you&rsquo;ll be facing.
Currently, Shadow Snorlax is one of the hardest Shadow Pokémon available in Pokémon Go.
Thanks to the evil infecting Shadow Snorlax, it has the ability to use fast Ghost and Psychic type moves as well as charged Normal, Ground and Steel moves. This means that Shadow Snorlax can&rsquo;t be defeated by the Pokémon, such as Machamp, that would easily knock out a Normal type Pokémon.
Here is a list of Pokémon, and the moves they can use, that would make an ideal team to take down a Shadow Snorlax or two:</p><p>Tyranitar - Ideal Moves: Smash Down / Crunch Ursaring - Ideal Moves: Counter / Close Combat Lucario - Ideal Moves: Counter / Power-Up Punch Weavile - Ideal Moves: Ice Shard / Avalanche Dragonite - Ideal Moves: Dragon Breath / Dragon Claw Metagross - Ideal Moves: Bullet Punch / Meteor Mash</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve been lucky with the Legendaries, you could also call on them for help:</p><p>Lugia - Ideal Moves:Extrasensory / Sky Attack Latios - Ideal Moves: Dragon Breath / Dragon Claw Dialga - Ideal Moves: Dragon Breath / Dragon Claw Palkia - Ideal Moves: Dragon Breath / Dragon Meteor Heatran - Ideal Moves: Fire Spin / Stone Edge</p><p>Don&rsquo;t forget to use your shields to block any of Shadow Snorlax&rsquo;s charged moves!
Thank you to celandro from reddit for the help with this information.
It&rsquo;s unknown whether all of the following will be available in the game when the Purification mechanic releases, but at the very least, the following are in the game files and should appear at some point (thanks to martycochrane on reddit for helping with the following):</p><p>Krabby (Gen 1) Kingler (Gen 1) Rhyhorn (Gen 1) Rhydon (Gen 1) Kangaskhan (Gen 1) Murkrow (Gen 2) Chimchar (Gen 4) Monferno (Gen 4) Infernape (Gen 4) Honchkrow (Gen 4) Gible (Gen 4) Gabite (Gen 4) Garchomp (Gen 4) Rhyperior (Gen 4)</p><p>In the spin-offs, there are far more Shadow Pokémon that what&rsquo;s listed here - well over a hundred - which also include the Legendary Birds Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres, as well as Lugia.
Pokkén Tournament also introduced Shadow Mewtwo - and it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see whether the list of Pokémon Go Shadow creatures will be expanded over time.
Elsewhere, it was also technically possible to get Shiny Shadow Pokémon - though it was mostly through a glitch that was later corrected with Pokémon XD.
Chances are Pokémon Go&rsquo;s Shadow Pokemon won&rsquo;t be shiny as a result, but here&rsquo;s a look at someone going through the process in Pokémon Coliseum if you&rsquo;re interested:
The Season of Mythical Wishes continues with the Winter Holiday event, which has brought Mega Glalie to Pokémon Go. Don&rsquo;t forget to partake in the new Go Battle League season.
Elsewhere, be sure to use Daily Adventure Incense for the chance of encountering Galarian Articuno, Galarian Zapdos and Galarian Moltres.</p><p>Purified Pokemon can not be transferred to either Pokemon Let&rsquo;s Go Pikachu or Pokemon Let&rsquo;s Go Eevee. Purifying a fainted Shadow Pokemon will restore it to full health. A change several days after release meant Shadow Pokémon cannot be traded, though Purified Pokémon can. You can place Shadow Pokémon in a gym, which gives the gym a very spooky atmosphere when you visit. Purified Pokémon can also be put in gyms, but it doesn&rsquo;t look as cool. Shadow Pokémon cannot undergo Mega Evolution. Want to celebrate catching a new Shadow Pokémon? Then take a photo of it with Pokémon Go&rsquo;s AR mode! The Shadow Pokémon will be so happy that it you want to take its photo that it will lose its angry expression. Unlike Event or Legendary Pokémon, Purified Pokémon can be mass transferred - so be careful! When you purify a Shadow Pokémon the move Frustration will be replaced with Return. You can find a Lucky Shadow Pokémon, meaning you can also have a Lucky Purified Pokémon. Want to know how many Zubats you&rsquo;ve purified? Then head to the PokéDex and look under the Zubat entry. Every possible Shadow Pokémon now has a Purified counter, alongside Seen, Caught and Lucky.</p><p>While Shadow Pokémon are more powerful than regular Pokémon, the corruption infecting them eventually causes them to turn on their teammates. The only way to save Shadow Pokémon from this corruption is purify them.
Purification return the Shadow Pokémon to normal, while also increasing their stats.
Shadow Pokémon joined Pokémon Go alongside Team Go Rocket. The evil organisation are using the Shadow Pokémon to help them invade PokéStops.
Team Go Rocket&rsquo;s arrival was first teased after Pokémon Go Fest at Chicago in 2019. After the Fest had ended festival goers discovered that Grunts had photobombed the pictures they had taken with Pokémon Go&rsquo;s AR photo mode.
This photobombing continued at Pokémon Go Fest in Dortmund later than year. A Team Go Rocket hot air balloon was even spotted floating in the sky above the festival.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/pokemon_go_catching_a_shadow_pokemon.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/pokemon_go_catching_a_shadow_pokemon.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Pok mon Go Shadow Pok mon counters  how to beat Shadow Snorlax and how Purified Pok mon work -
