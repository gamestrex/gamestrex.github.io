Pokemon Blazed Glazed This ROM hack is essentially the same as Pokemon Glaze and follows the same plot. However, the stats, moves, and so on are modified. Also, the range of spawned Wild Pokemon differentiates this hack from Pokemon Glaze. The main attributes of the game are:\nPokemon from Gen 1 to Gen VI Access to 5 Pokemon at the beginning itself Changed Stats \u0026 Moves\n11. Pokemon Liquid Crystal This is a hybrid of a FireRed hack and Pokemon Crystal remake. It has the same narrative and characteristics as Crystal. New activities, updated sprites, and updated animations are also added You will have a lot of material to discover, ranging from Johto to Kanto. The main attributes of the game are:\nRevamped graphics Weather effects New events Lovely audios and sounds Hidden areas\n12. Pokemon Prism Pokemon Prism is a hack of Pokemon Crystal that shares the same theme.

The main attributes of the game are:\nThree new types introduced: Fairy, Gas \u0026 Sound Access to four crafting skills 2D side scroller movements in some regions\n13. Pokemon Adventure Red Chapter Despite being based on the manga Pokemon Red (Adventured), the game is entirely a simulation in which you play as Red and interact with the other characters from the manga. It has new graphics, features, and mechanics. I think this is a must-try and one of the best Pokemon ROM Hacks. The main attributes of the game are:\nReusable TMs Mega Evolution availability Has IV \u0026 EV checker\n14. Pokemon Unbound This is a revamped version of FireRed that features the same stories plus different places, sites, and other features.

With this game, you should expect a bumpy ride and nerve-wracking challenges. The gameplay is challenging but satisfying. The main attributes of the game are:\nEV training areas Coloured IV from the beginning itself Modified stats, abilities, moves, etc.\n16. Pokemon Flora Sky Pokemon Flora sky adds a lot to the OG Pokemon Emerald. With a whopping 360 new pokemons and some of them having new moves as well, there will be a lot of new things for you to discover. The USP of the ROM is how it changes the whole structure of the game. Players won’t have to grind their way through all the gyms and city’s instead they will have to find and locate things to advance further in the game. This fixes the monotony of the game and makes it more interesting. The ROM also introduces more items in the game and makes catching Rotom a bit easier.\n17. Pokemon Light Platinum Pokemon Light Platinum adds the Zhery Region to the Pokemon Ruby game. Players can interact and challenge the new gym leaders of the Zhery Region and also catch pokemon from the Sinnoh, Hoenn, Kanto, and Jhoto regions. The ROM will also add some new special events and the Pokemon World Championship as well.\n18. Pokemon Mega Power While other ROM’s add new features and regions to the game Mega Power changes the direction of the OG Pokemon Emerald. The characters start experimenting on the Pokemons to make the strongest pokemon. Experimentations cost money and hence the need for funds arises. A Financer comes around to help them but asks them to go a shady quest for him. To know what does the Financer wants and how things turn out you’ll have to play the game. The ROM also adds three new regions to Pokemon Emerald and all the Mega evolutions of the generations IV, V, VI, and VII.\n19. Pokemon Mega Emerald X and Y As the name suggests Mega Emerald X and Y is a simple yet fun ROM to have in Pokemon Emerald. The ROM adds almost all the elements of Pokemon X and Y to Pokemon Emerald, from Pokemons of gen I to VI to all the Legendary pokemon. There is a lot for fans of the Pokemon franchise. This is just a big Pokemon game that players should try.\n20. Pokemon Dark Cry As the name suggests the ROM takes a dark turn in the world of Pokemon hacks. You wake up in a cavern and see a person with an “R” on his shirt. Suspecting he is from Team rocket you try to chase him but aren’t able to catch him. An earthquake follows and a shadow keeps getting closer to you, when it gets very close and things go dark you wake up again in the same cavern only to realize it was all a dream. Soon you realize your dream is becoming the reality and things start getting spookier. Players start in a new region called Trion, where you’ll have to read the Pokepaper to get new quests and side-quests and advance further in the game.

The main attributes of the game are:</p><p>So many Pokemon to catch So many quests to solve Highly customized</p><h3 id=15-pokemon-radical-red>15. Pokemon Radical Red<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#15-pokemon-radical-red>#</a></h3><p>This is both a variation and a hack of Pokemon FireRed. With this game, you should expect a bumpy ride and nerve-wracking challenges. The gameplay is challenging but satisfying.
The main attributes of the game are:</p><p>EV training areas Coloured IV from the beginning itself Modified stats, abilities, moves, etc.</p><h3 id=16-pokemon-flora-sky>16. Pokemon Flora Sky<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#16-pokemon-flora-sky>#</a></h3><p>Pokemon Flora sky adds a lot to the OG Pokemon Emerald. With a whopping 360 new pokemons and some of them having new moves as well, there will be a lot of new things for you to discover. The USP of the ROM is how it changes the whole structure of the game. Players won’t have to grind their way through all the gyms and city’s instead they will have to find and locate things to advance further in the game. This fixes the monotony of the game and makes it more interesting. The ROM also introduces more items in the game and makes catching Rotom a bit easier.</p><h3 id=17-pokemon-light-platinum>17. Pokemon Light Platinum<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#17-pokemon-light-platinum>#</a></h3><p>Pokemon Light Platinum adds the Zhery Region to the Pokemon Ruby game. Players can interact and challenge the new gym leaders of the Zhery Region and also catch pokemon from the Sinnoh, Hoenn, Kanto, and Jhoto regions. The ROM will also add some new special events and the Pokemon World Championship as well.</p><h3 id=18-pokemon-mega-power>18. Pokemon Mega Power<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#18-pokemon-mega-power>#</a></h3><p>While other ROM’s add new features and regions to the game Mega Power changes the direction of the OG Pokemon Emerald. The characters start experimenting on the Pokemons to make the strongest pokemon. Experimentations cost money and hence the need for funds arises. A Financer comes around to help them but asks them to go a shady quest for him. To know what does the Financer wants and how things turn out you’ll have to play the game.
The ROM also adds three new regions to Pokemon Emerald and all the Mega evolutions of the generations IV, V, VI, and VII.</p><h3 id=19-pokemon-mega-emerald-x-and-y>19. Pokemon Mega Emerald X and Y<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#19-pokemon-mega-emerald-x-and-y>#</a></h3><p>As the name suggests Mega Emerald X and Y is a simple yet fun ROM to have in Pokemon Emerald. The ROM adds almost all the elements of Pokemon X and Y to Pokemon Emerald, from Pokemons of gen I to VI to all the Legendary pokemon. There is a lot for fans of the Pokemon franchise. This is just a big Pokemon game that players should try.</p><h3 id=20-pokemon-dark-cry>20. Pokemon Dark Cry<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#20-pokemon-dark-cry>#</a></h3><p>As the name suggests the ROM takes a dark turn in the world of Pokemon hacks. You wake up in a cavern and see a person with an “R” on his shirt. Suspecting he is from Team rocket you try to chase him but aren’t able to catch him. An earthquake follows and a shadow keeps getting closer to you, when it gets very close and things go dark you wake up again in the same cavern only to realize it was all a dream. Soon you realize your dream is becoming the reality and things start getting spookier.
Players start in a new region called Trion, where you’ll have to read the Pokepaper to get new quests and side-quests and advance further in the game.
