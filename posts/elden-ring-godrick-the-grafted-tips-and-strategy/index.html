Elden Ring’s Godrick the Grafted boss encounter is extremely challenging, even for seasoned From Software players. For this fight, we’d highly recommend summoning either another player, or a spirit ash summon. On this page: Looking for some direction? Our what to do first in Elden Ring, Elden Ring walkthrough, Site of Grace locations and main bosses in order pages can help. Alternatively, if you’re using a ranged/magic build in Elden Ring (you’ll need to find a staff location first) you’ll want to make sure you’ve got offensive spells that don’t take long to cast. Godrick moves around the arena at a pretty rapid pace, so if you are going to be lobbing spells around, you don’t want to be stationary for too long. As well as the Warrior you can summon at the entrance, make sure you’ve got a summon spirit that’s composed of more than one character. Godrick hits hard, and is liable to take down a single companion in a hit or two, so for maximum distraction, consider using a summon like the Wandering Nobles, or the wolves that split up and run at the boss individually, which will draw Godrick’s attention for longer. This attack is actually usually preceded by an air-based attack. We’re not exactly sure how Godrick does it, but he spends a few second spinning up waves of air around him, which results in three increasingly large area-based attacks around him. Make sure you back well off during this attack, because it’s usually succeeded by the rolling attack we mentioned above. Another attack that’s absolutely essential to watch out for is when Godrick wields his axe upside down with two hands, and brings the head of it crashing down onto the floor. This is an area-of-effect shockwave attack, which actually lets off one wave when it hits the ground, then another wave approximately two seconds later. Dodge roll through the first wave, then jump over the second wave, and slice at Godrick with your weapon while in mid-air. This is a great tactic for landing a heavy blow to the boss while dodging through one of his harder-hitting attacks. You’ll also want to rapidly back away from Godrick’s chain attack. The signal for this attack is when Godrick holds both of axes behind him on the same side as his body, after which he’ll let rip with five or six slicing attack. Either dodging through these or just running away from them are perfectly viable options, since you won’t have time to get off an attack on Godrick in between dodging each attack. When Godrick’s down to anywhere between having half and a third of his health left, an absolutely metal cutscene plays out, where the Grafted wields a dragon’s head and its flame-breathing attack. The flame-breathing attack is now in play, but dodging this simply requires you to sprint around Godrick on the opposite side to which the attack starts, thus giving you maximum time to evade the flames. Godrick continues this attack for a few seconds even if you dodge it, so use the opportunity to hammer home a good few hits. One thing that’s really important to note is that in this second phase, the shockwave attack we mentioned above now comes in three waves. This time, therefore, you need to back away instead of rolling through and dodging the second wave, because there’s now three opportunities for Godrick to land a potentially-deadly hit on you. Once you have settled on a starting class and starting Keepsake item, you should first work out how to level up, how to respec and use Ashes of War.\rNeed some direction from there? Our Elden Ring walkthrough and Elden Ring boss order can help with where to go next, but we also recommend hunting down Golden Seeds, Sacred Tears, Crystal Tears, Talismans and some of our best weapon and best armor choices.\rIf you are approaching the end game, we can help with the Volcano Manor quest and Rykard, Haligtree Secret Medallion locations, solving the Ordina, Liturgical Town puzzle, the Millicent quest, Commander Niall, Morgott, Godskin Duo, Maliketh and Malenia.\rAdditionally, you’ll gain Godrick’s Great Rune, and the Remembrance of the Grafted item.
