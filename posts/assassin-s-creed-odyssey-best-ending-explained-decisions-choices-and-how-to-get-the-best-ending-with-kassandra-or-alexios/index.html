Now there are those dialogue choices and in-game decisions that shape not just the Ancient Grecian world around you but the ebb and flow of the story itself. With just so much content to make your way through, it’s very easy to get lost in the story and completely miss those important moments when they come and go. So, to ensure you get the best Assassin’s Creed Odyssey ending possible, we’ve put together this comprehensive guide. However, since we’re dealing with important plot points, this guide will be full of spoilers from this point on, so tread carefully… On this page: There are three separate story arcs in Assassin’s Creed Odyssey - the Family Story, the Cult of Kosmos and the First Civ - but the core decisions that shape your ending are only tied to the main Family Story arc. Of course, pursuing the other two arcs will benefit you with more XP, better gear and greater appreciate Ubisoft Quebec’s open-world craft, but it’s the main arc we’ll be dealing with here. There are plenty of other narrative choices and actions that influence the game world, including NPCs and side-quest factors, but these won’t have a bearing on the outcome of the main Family Story so don’t worry about ruining your playthrough by dabbling in some side-quest fun. Those big six plot points are:\nSpare Nikolaus during Chapter Two. Promise Myrinne you will try to save Deimos from the Cult of Kosmos in Chapter Six. Convince Nikolaus to intervene with Stentor when you encounter both again during Chapter Seven. Do not kill Stentor in Chapter Seven. Start convincing Deimos that the Cult is manipulating the both of you during Chapter Eight. Refuse to fight Deimos in Chapter Nine.\nPull off all six of those key decisions above and the ‘Best’ ending is yours when the credits roll. Just make sure you have those extra save slots ready just in case you make a mistake. Looking for more help? Our main Assassin’s Creed Odyssey guide and tips hub gives you an overview of our pages, while we also have all fifty-plus Ainigmata Ostraka puzzle locations and solutions, plus more on how to get the Assassin’s Creed Odyssey best ending, a list of all Assassin’s Creed Odyssey tomb solutions, the best weapons, armour, engravings, and legendary armour and weapons listed, the Kalydonian Boar strategy and location, Orichalcum locations and even help with Assassin’s Creed Odyssey romance options. Elsewhere we can help with how to earn money and Drachmae fast in Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, how to earn XP and level up fast in Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, and our picks for the best side quests in Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.\rSpare Nikolaus’ life during your encounter in Chapter Two Regardless of whether you’re playing as Alexios or as Kassandra, you will eventually come face to face with the man who threw you to your ‘death’ as a child. In order to meet The Wolf of Sparta in person, you’ll need to complete some tasks for his new adopted son, Stentor. This will lead you to the mission The Final Push in Chapter Two, where you will engage in your first Conquest Battle. You’ll be fighting alongside the Spartans against the Athenians, so you’ll need to kill enough soldiers to deplete the blue bar on-screen (focusing on captains will speed this process up considerably). When the battle is over, Stentor will speak to you, but leave with a bad taste in his mouth when the Wolf requests your presence and yours alone. When you finally meet Nikolaus in person (as part of the Wolf of Sparta mission), you’ll reveal your true identity and demand to know why your own father threw you to your doom. When you remind him that there’s a bounty on his head, you then have the following two choices: ‘I’ve come to take my revenge’ and ‘I’ve come to get answers’. Pick the second one, as this will ensure that Nikolaus lives (so you can encounter him again in Chapter Seven). Encounter with Deimos and telling Myrinne that you will help save Deimos from the Cult During Chapter Three, you will head to a Forge where you’ll enhance the power of the Spear of Leonidas. When you leave, Deimos will be waiting for you. The conversation that follows can degenerate into a fight since Deimos is so unstable. Avoid this at all costs by choosing the passive responses that reiterate that you want to save him from the Cult, and stop their manipulation of him. Later, in Chapter Six, your plan to reveal the Spartan leader known as Pheonix will uncover their identity as Myrinne, your estranged mother. Eventually, you will have a conversation with her about Deimos. Since this is in actual fact Alexios, your little brother, you will need to tell Myrinne that you want to help save Deimos, not take revenge on him for what he’s done to hinder your actions thus far. This dialogue is very easy to miss since it’s so subtle, but choosing this option will ensure you stay on the path to the ‘Best’ ending. Convince Nikolaus to intervene with Stentor and not fighting Stentor Towards the end of Chapter Seven, you will be sent assist a Spartan general in the region of Boeotia. Turns out that contact is Stentor, the stepbrother who just happens to hate your guts. He’ll charge you with a mission to kill four Boeotian champions in order to weaken the Athenian army before the coming Conquest Battle. Kill three of them, then when you go to kill the fourth, you’ll find them fighting someone. It’s Nikolaus! Since you spared his life in Chapter Two, he’s now returned out of guilt to assist Stentor. In this conversation, you must convince him to go to Stentor and offer his support in person. If you don’t, well, things won’t turn out so well after the battle. Return to Stentor, and the Conquest Battle in Boeotia will begin (the mission for this is ‘The Conquerer). Focus on captains, kill the Merc, then win the battle. After the dust settles, Stentor and the Hero will speak. However, it’s clear Stentor has a score to settle and - whatever your dialogue choices - the two will begin circling one another ready for battle. At the last minute, Nikolaus will step in and stop the fight, convincing Stentor he is up to the task. Convince Deimos that the Cult is manipulating you both in Chapter Eight At the end of Chapter Seven, following the fight with Deimos, a tree will fall on top of him. Select the option ‘Hold On!’ to help with the conversation that follows in the next chapter. At the very start of Chapter Eight, you’ll be in a prison cell and Deimos will come to interrogate you. Choose the following options (in the order shown) in order to convince him the Cult of Cosmos is manipulating him: Doing so will see Deimos respond with “I am not your puppet!” when Kleon tells him to leave. If he says this, you know you’ve made a big impact on him and helped your chances of getting a ‘Happy’ ending. There may be other ways of reaching this response from Deimos, but this was the one that we used. Refuse to fight Deimos in Chapter Nine Following the battle, Deimos will be struck by an error shot by Kleon. You can’t go back to his fallen form, so instead chase after Kleon and kill him. When Chapter Nine begins, head to the cliff top where your story began and face Deimos. He’s recovered now, but angrier the ever. Choose the most passive options in the dialogue, then when he challenges you to a fight, refuse. You’ll then offer Deimos your spear, he’ll break down and the family will be united once more. There will then be a short cutscene back at your old family home, where - if you’ve pulled off the best ending, you’ll see the Hero, Deimos, Myrinne, Nikolaus and Stentor all sat down for dinner. Your odyssey is at an end, and in the best possible way.\n","wordCount":"1380","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-24T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-24T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Nicole Sanchez"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/assassin-s-creed-odyssey-best-ending-explained-decisions-choices-and-how-to-get-the-best-ending-with-kassandra-or-alexios/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Assassin S Creed Odyssey Best Ending Explained Decisions Choices And How To Get The Best Ending With Kassandra Or Alexios</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 24, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1380 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Nicole Sanchez</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>Odyssey fully embraces its desire to be a full-on RPG then, and that means more than just levelling, more elaborate questing and tons of loot.
