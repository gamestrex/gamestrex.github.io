If you’re a fan of LEGO games in general, then we have other cheats pages, including LEGO Star Wars Force Awakens cheat codes, LEGO Harry Potter cheat codes, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes cheat codes and LEGO Incredibles cheat codes pages. The following cheats are made available by collecting Red Bricks in the main and side-missions:\nStud Magnet Fast Build Fast Interact Studs x8 Studs x2 Studs x6 Destroy On Contact Super Slap Studs x4 Regenerating Hearts Collect Guide Studs The Funk Awakens Infinite Torpedoes Studs x10 Fast Force Imperial Inaccuracy Regenerating Combat Bar Super Disco Blasters\nThe following cheats are available from the start of the game:\nSuper Detonators Super Silly Sabers Disco Sabers Squeaky Voices Collectible Detector Silly Torpedoes Super Strength\nPrologue - The Battle of Endor\rThe first Red Brick location is pretty straightforward. In the Endor Shield Generator stage, after locking down the multi-build object from the tree with Wicket, build a ladder on the left side, where the brick is above. Chapter 1 - Assault on Jakku\rIn the Village Retreat, on the far right, you can multi-build two Stormtrooper scarecrows. Build each of them, then destroy them, to drop the Red Brick. Chapter 2 - Escape from the Finalizer\rIn the Finalizer Hangar, once you use the droid and FN-2187’s helmet comes off, you can multi-build bricks in one of three places. Build the north-most structure, creating a bridge to the red brick. Chapter 3 - Niima Outpost\rAt the very start, in the Niima Outpost area, after you slide to the right under the barrier but before you move the ship down the hill, there’s silver debris off in the distance outside the area. In Free Play, and with an explosive-throwing character like Chewbacca, who can blow it apart, causing a Red Brick to drop in via parachute. Cute! Chapter 4 - The Eravana\rDuring the Freighter Battle, after you detonate the silver bricks with explosives with Chewbacca, forcing the monster to retreat, pull down wall to the right with a rope grapple to get the brick. Chapter 5 - Maz’s Castle\rAt the very start of the level, during the Castle Approach section, there is a cracked wall on the front of the castle. Switch to a character while in Free Play mode that can smash open cracked bricks to get the Red Brick. Chapter 6 - Battle of Takodana\rDuring the Takodana Skies section, as you’re flying Poe Dameron’s X-wing, take out the first wave of TIE Fighters, triggering a cutscene showing troop transports arriving, and the tower of the castle being destroyed. Fly over where the tower was, and a Red Brick will be waiting hovering above. Chapter 7 - The Resistance\rDuring the Resistance Hanger section, take the lift on the right up to the upper level (chat to the character nearby to call it down) where there is a cracked brick wall. In Free Play, use a character that can crack it open, then a smaller character to crawl through the vent, to get the Brick. Chapter 8 - Starkiller Sabotage\rIn the opening Starkiller Crash Site area, the Red Brick is located in a cave next to the base doorway after you jump from handhold-to-handhold over the steep drop. To reach it, construct the multi-build to the left, and jump onto the newly-constructed snowman to grab the railing and shimmy right. Chapter 9 - Destroy Starkiller Base\rDuring Rey’s Escape, after you come back together again after splitting up, you come to a dead end and have to create a lift that goes up. After that, control FN-1824 so you can rope up to the upper level, and instead of continuing up with a ladder you can create, go right, and use the console to open the door on the right. Stormtroopers will stream into the room, and after several waves, the door will reveal the Red Brick. Chapter 10 - The Finale\rYou’ll be needing to come at this in Free Play to unlock this Red Brick. Before you approach Kylo Ren at the end of the Starkiller Showdown section, go to the lower right side of the area, and with a Force user like Luke, roll the snowball over to the left and under the brick, where it’ll accumulate snow and grow bigger, allowing you to double jump and collect your prize. Epilogue - Luke’s Island\rAfter Chewie retracts the vines to allow Rey to swing from pole-to-pole along the cliffside, there is a pile of Dark Side Force rubble. In Free Play mode, clear this pile of rubble, then switch to a small character to crawl through the hole to emerge elsewhere, where the Red Brick awaits. Poe to the Rescue\rIn the Hangar Battle area - which takes place after you exit the trash compactor section and enter the Hangar Battle’s opening corridor - on the left side are a couple of black canisters. You can blast these out the way and walk through the wall to a hidden room, which is in fact Kylo Ren’s bedroom. In Free Play mode, use a Dark Force character (Darth Vader seems fitting here, right?) to smash apart every piece of furniture, until the Brick is yours. Ottegan Assault\rAfter the flight section and when you’re on the Ottegan Surface, run all the way to the left side to cracked wall. In Free Play, smash open the wall using a large character to get the Red Brick. LEGO Star Wars Force Awakens codes and cheats list\rUnlock additional characters easily with these cheat codes. LEGO Star Wars Force Awakens - character list and unlock guide\rHow to unlock all 200+ characters, from Admiral Ackbar to Yoda. LEGO Star Wars Force Awakens - How to farm studs\rEarn at least 500,000 studs in less than five minutes. Trouble over Taul\rIn the Corvette Interior area, after the opening corridor and the second air lock blows, you have to go down the right corridor. Instead, in Free Play mode, use the terminal on the left, opening a path to a ladder. Head down, and at the end of the corridor (be sure to use a Dark Force character like Vader to get a few easy mini-kits in the section) and switch to a cold-resistant character to get the Brick. Lor San Tekka’s Return\rPlay the stage until you come to a canyon that’s gusting some heavy winds. At this point, come forward towards the screen, revealing another area that you can drop down to on the left. Use a robot like BB-8 on the wall panel in the corner, powering up the Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots. Simply punch and slash away at the controls at the front - it’s more fun with two of you playing at once, obviously! - until you score three points, rewarding you with a Brick. The Crimson Corsair\rIn the Landing Site section, once you have blown up a generator with explosives and see the yellow robot flying out through the door, switch to Sidon Ithano and grapple the robot above and to the left to the upper ledge. Walk to the foreground, and make your way to the other side of the area by grappling right then wall running over. When you drop down, destroy the blocks to the right and instead of building a traffic light so the other characters can jump across, build the device to the right side to open the door. Destroy the yellow robot within for the Red Brick. Rathtar Hunting\rAs you’re climbing up the cliffs by the waterfall, Chewie will have to pull a wall open to reveal a trampoline. As you leap up, instead of going right, head left to find a hidden passage to take you to a different area. Walk to the end of this pathway to find this level’s Red Brick.\n","wordCount":"1410","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-22T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ian Rodrigues"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/lego-star-wars-force-awakens-red-brick-locations/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Lego Star Wars Force Awakens Red Brick Locations</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 22, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1410 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Ian Rodrigues</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>There is one in every mission in the game, as well as a handful that are available to use from the get-go.
