To do that, were to assign each console 1 to 3 points in five different categories (one point went to the last or third-place console, two points went to the second-place console, and 3 points went to the first-place console). For reference, heres a summary and explanation of the categories well be using to rate each console: Sales How many units of every next-gen console sold in 2021? This category is based on the official sales of the most recent publication and on the most reliable available estimates. Hardware This category provides the advantages and disadvantages of every hardware piece in the consoles. The distinction between products offered in the category of offering exclusive services is presented in the category of service points in this category. These services are typically optional in comparison to hardware. Exklusive Games are awarded for its quality of the exclusive games released in 2021 by each console. The Future This category relates to exclusive games and services revealed for 2022 and beyond. The trick is the lack of this in the way.\nThe Nintendo Switch: 2021 In Review. There’s 3 points at sales. The official sales numbers for any next-gen console are sometimes subject to a reasonable margin of error, but there is still little doubt that the Nintendo Switch had major success in the sales year. In fact, some estimates suggest that Nintendo will have sold nearly twenty million Switch units by the end of 2021. The Switchs earliest release date and multiple hardware options certainly give it a lot of power in this department. However, if you look closely at the consoles’ lifetime sales, it probably won’t be the best-selling of the three next-gen consoles by the time the war is over.\nHardware two points. Despite the inconvenient release of the Switch OLED, some of the years’ biggest controversies, it remains difficult to reveal that the Switchs hardware design is still one of the biggest contributors to its incredible success. Time will tell whether Sony and Microsoft will even try directly to rival the Switchs hybrid design, but at the moment, Nintendo has cornered that market with one of the most interesting and innovative consoles ever.\nSupport 2 Points. Although Nintendo finally decided to add N64 and Sega Genesis games to Switch Online this year, the subpar quality of those N64 ports, as well as the premium price required for access to a relatively limited library of retro games, didn’t really even go to a home run. In fact, Nintendo doesn’t seem as interested in digital services as their competitors, but naturally, they’re gonna fall last in this particular category.\nExclusive Games, 1 penalty. It didn’t be a terrible year for Switch exclusives (Metroid Dread was fantastic and New Pokemon Snap, Mario Party Superstars and Mario Golf: Super Rush were all solid or better), but it showed clear that Nintendos reliance on their own properties hit them particularly hard in a year when everyone struggled to get major games out of the door. However, Nintendo should be improving from here.\nThe second point of the future is the topic of two next points. Few upcoming exclusives can match the power of Breath of the Wild 2, but even if such a game would displace the surface of the Earth, Switch fans still have Splatoon 3, Metroid Prime 4, Pokemon Legends: Arceus, Mario + Rabbids: Sparks Of Hope, Triangle Strategy and more to look forward to in the (hopefully) near future. It would be nice to see some of those games getting released this year, but the Switchs future certainly looks interesting.\nRead more Games\nThe Most Underrated Games of 2021 were 15 games. By Matthew Byrd. Games\n10 Best Video Games from 2021. By Matthew Byrd.\nPlayStation 5: 2021 The movie is in a revision phase. Sales two points. Although the PS5 refueled the Switchs sales streak at some point this year, Sony did expect to sell it again. The exact numbers are still unaccounted for, but Sony is apparently going to ship just shy of 15 million PS5s by the end of the year (based on the quarterly reports and Q4 estimates existing). I’m certainly interested in seeing whether PS5 will end up outselling the Switch in 2022 as a new PlayStation 3 (hopefully) move forward.\nHardware 1 Point. While I absolutely love the PS5 controller, I have to say that I haven’t yet fully implemented the PS5 Control Center, yet I haven’t used many of the features that Sony promoted until the next-gen consoles release. While the PS5 offers some native backward compatibility options (something that the Switch certainly can’t boast) the limited nature of the system is different from the Xbox Series X and sometimes the occasional controversial next-gen upgrade policies make even that hardware feature even a bit difficult. There are several questions. However, I think it’s going to look more appealing in 2022 than in 2022 instead of 2022, because more developers focus on the true PS5 exclusives that can use the consoles’ power.\nService 2 Points: PlayStation Now confenses the PS5 a more advantageous position in this area; its free monthly games are very comparable to those offered by the other nap services. However, no Sony gaming device can provide the same value as Game Pass and everything Microsoft has built around that service. I wonder whether that will change in 2022 as the PlayStation team prepares to introduce an expanded subscription service.\nExclusive Games 2 points. While I previously speculated that the PS5s 2021 exclusives would be better than the Xbox Series X exclusives, that was before a series of filmtape and the film The Final Fantasy project was delayed to 2022. Those delays made it a little different. However, Returnal, Deathloop, and Ratchet And Clank: Rift Apart ended up being GOTY quality exclusives, and smaller titles like Kena: Bridge of Spirits and Stray helped to complete the PS5s exclusive lineup.\nThe 3 next point is one. God of War Ragnarok should be on any shortlist of the most anticipated exclusives, but its truly the potential of the major upcoming PS5 games like Final Fantasy XVI, the KOTOR remake, Marvels Wolverine, Gran Turismo, Forbidden West, Ghostwire Tokyo, and Marvels Spider-Man 2 that gives Sony the advantage in this category. Even if the PlayStation team doesn’t first release the rumored new game streaming service next year, it’s about to be a lot better to be a PS5 owner.\nXbox series X/S: 2021 In Review: 2021 Sales 1 point. Microsoft is notoriously private when it comes to releasing exact Xbox hardware sales figures, but even the most generous estimates suggest that the Xbox Series X/S will end in third in terms of next-gen unit sales. I’d guess the PS5 will sell the Series X in 2021 by 5-6 million units, but that is honestly an educated guess based on rough estimates. To say that, due to the late-year sales increase of the Xbox X/S, Microsoft is heading on the road into 2022 with a lot of momentum.\n3 point Hardware. The PS5 upgraded SSD is likely to give it a push ahead of the Xbox Classic X, but in another year, when real next-gen exclusives were only a few and far from the beginning, it was the Series X’s quality of life and consumer-friendly features that separate it from the Xbox Series X. The Xbox Quick Resume feature is generally more useful than the PS5s Control Center and consoles are strictly better than the rest of the consoles. The Series S is, without doubt, the nicest next-gen console, obtainable in all the time.\nServices three points. The conversation starts and ends with the game pass. Microsoft took a huge risk when they decided to join the gaming subscription service, but every year since the Game Pass debut, we know how valuable it is. Throw in several stunning cloud-based game progamms that are seemingly destined to change the game at once, so it ended up being the easiest category to call in the fave of your Xboxs.\nExclusive games 3 points. If I wasn’t perfect, I didn’t expect Halo Infinite to be half that good as it ended up being. However, that game and Forza Horizon 5 ultimately gave Xbox the exclusive heavy hitters they’ve been missing in recent years. The PlayStation 5 still came out with one more cant miss major exclusive this year, but the two big guns were well supported by noteworthy smaller titles like Twelve Minutes, The Gunk, The Artful Escape, The Ascent, Microsoft Flight Simulator, and much more. This was a tough category to call, but the quantity of Xboxs quality exclusives eventually gave it an impressive edge.\nThe next point is the economic opportunity. While Microsoft has a narrow win in the exclusives competition this year, it’s important to remember that they still don’t typically emphasize exclusives like Sony and Nintendo do. Just like Starfield is one of 2022’s biggest games, questions remain about how many of the most notable titles on Xboxs other devices come out (such as Fable 4, Perfect Dark, Redfall, and Senuas Saga: Hellblade II) and who have been out of play now, make me more important of these companies. The paper looks like they have more sure things big hits in their arsenal. When i tried to answer the bigger question, what will happen next?\nPS5 vs. Xbox Series X/S vs. Nintendo Switch Who Won 2021? All the time: 8 points for Nintendo Switch Switch. Even in a slow year, the Nintendo Switch dominated the sales charts and proved its strength. Nintendo should be good news from here.\nFirst: PLayStation 5 10 Points. The PlayStation team may have suffered a bit by many delays and other circumstances beyond their control, but there is very little doubt the PS5 will soon become a worthy successor to the PS4!\nFirst place: Xbox X/S 11 points. Unlike the other Xbox era’s titles, the telegram’s sales were boosted. Xbox was the best year in many years.\n","wordCount":"1718","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-03T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-03T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jodi

I’m certainly interested in seeing whether PS5 will end up outselling the Switch in 2022 as a new PlayStation 3 (hopefully) move forward.</p><h3 id=hardware-1-point>Hardware 1 Point.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hardware-1-point>#</a></h3><p>While I absolutely love the PS5 controller, I have to say that I haven’t yet fully implemented the PS5 Control Center, yet I haven’t used many of the features that Sony promoted until the next-gen consoles release. While the PS5 offers some native backward compatibility options (something that the Switch certainly can’t boast) the limited nature of the system is different from the Xbox Series X and sometimes the occasional controversial next-gen upgrade policies make even that hardware feature even a bit difficult.
There are several questions. However, I think it’s going to look more appealing in 2022 than in 2022 instead of 2022, because more developers focus on the true PS5 exclusives that can use the consoles’ power.</p><h3 id=service-2-points>Service 2 Points:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#service-2-points>#</a></h3><p>PlayStation Now confenses the PS5 a more advantageous position in this area; its free monthly games are very comparable to those offered by the other nap services.
However, no Sony gaming device can provide the same value as Game Pass and everything Microsoft has built around that service. I wonder whether that will change in 2022 as the PlayStation team prepares to introduce an expanded subscription service.</p><h3 id=exclusive-games-2-points>Exclusive Games 2 points.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#exclusive-games-2-points>#</a></h3><p>While I previously speculated that the PS5s 2021 exclusives would be better than the Xbox Series X exclusives, that was before a series of filmtape and the film The Final Fantasy project was delayed to 2022. Those delays made it a little different.
However, Returnal, Deathloop, and Ratchet And Clank: Rift Apart ended up being GOTY quality exclusives, and smaller titles like Kena: Bridge of Spirits and Stray helped to complete the PS5s exclusive lineup.</p><h3 id=the-3-next-point-is-one>The 3 next point is one.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-3-next-point-is-one>#</a></h3><p>God of War Ragnarok should be on any shortlist of the most anticipated exclusives, but its truly the potential of the major upcoming PS5 games like Final Fantasy XVI, the KOTOR remake, Marvels Wolverine, Gran Turismo, Forbidden West, Ghostwire Tokyo, and Marvels Spider-Man 2 that gives Sony the advantage in this category.
Even if the PlayStation team doesn’t first release the rumored new game streaming service next year, it’s about to be a lot better to be a PS5 owner.</p><h2 id=xbox-series-xs-2021-in-review-2021>Xbox series X/S: 2021 In Review: 2021<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#xbox-series-xs-2021-in-review-2021>#</a></h2><h3 id=sales-1-point>Sales 1 point.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sales-1-point>#</a></h3><p>Microsoft is notoriously private when it comes to releasing exact Xbox hardware sales figures, but even the most generous estimates suggest that the Xbox Series X/S will end in third in terms of next-gen unit sales. I’d guess the PS5 will sell the Series X in 2021 by 5-6 million units, but that is honestly an educated guess based on rough estimates.
To say that, due to the late-year sales increase of the Xbox X/S, Microsoft is heading on the road into 2022 with a lot of momentum.</p><h3 id=3-point-hardware>3 point Hardware.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-point-hardware>#</a></h3><p>The PS5 upgraded SSD is likely to give it a push ahead of the Xbox Classic X, but in another year, when real next-gen exclusives were only a few and far from the beginning, it was the Series X’s quality of life and consumer-friendly features that separate it from the Xbox Series X.
The Xbox Quick Resume feature is generally more useful than the PS5s Control Center and consoles are strictly better than the rest of the consoles. The Series S is, without doubt, the nicest next-gen console, obtainable in all the time.</p><h3 id=services-three-points>Services three points.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#services-three-points>#</a></h3><p>The conversation starts and ends with the game pass. Microsoft took a huge risk when they decided to join the gaming subscription service, but every year since the Game Pass debut, we know how valuable it is.
Throw in several stunning cloud-based game progamms that are seemingly destined to change the game at once, so it ended up being the easiest category to call in the fave of your Xboxs.</p><h3 id=exclusive-games-3-points>Exclusive games 3 points.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#exclusive-games-3-points>#</a></h3><p>If I wasn’t perfect, I didn’t expect Halo Infinite to be half that good as it ended up being. However, that game and Forza Horizon 5 ultimately gave Xbox the exclusive heavy hitters they’ve been missing in recent years.
The PlayStation 5 still came out with one more cant miss major exclusive this year, but the two big guns were well supported by noteworthy smaller titles like Twelve Minutes, The Gunk, The Artful Escape, The Ascent, Microsoft Flight Simulator, and much more. This was a tough category to call, but the quantity of Xboxs quality exclusives eventually gave it an impressive edge.</p><h3 id=the-next-point-is-the-economic-opportunity>The next point is the economic opportunity.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-next-point-is-the-economic-opportunity>#</a></h3><p>While Microsoft has a narrow win in the exclusives competition this year, it’s important to remember that they still don’t typically emphasize exclusives like Sony and Nintendo do. Just like Starfield is one of 2022’s biggest games, questions remain about how many of the most notable titles on Xboxs other devices come out (such as Fable 4, Perfect Dark, Redfall, and Senuas Saga: Hellblade II) and who have been out of play now, make me more important of these companies. The paper looks like they have more sure things big hits in their arsenal.
When i tried to answer the bigger question, what will happen next?</p><h2 id=ps5-vs-xbox-series-xs-vs-nintendo-switch-who-won-2021>PS5 vs. Xbox Series X/S vs. Nintendo Switch Who Won 2021?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ps5-vs-xbox-series-xs-vs-nintendo-switch-who-won-2021>#</a></h2><h3 id=all-the-time-8-points-for-nintendo-switch-switch>All the time: 8 points for Nintendo Switch Switch.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#all-the-time-8-points-for-nintendo-switch-switch>#</a></h3><p>Even in a slow year, the Nintendo Switch dominated the sales charts and proved its strength.
