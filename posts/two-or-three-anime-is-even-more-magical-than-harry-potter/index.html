Between our personal preferences and myAnimeList’s opinions, here’s a list of 10 anime available, or to come to a place to show your daily life a little magic.\nAnimals are already available. Black Clover A big name has chosen the favourite angle in shonen. Ninjas for Naruto, Hunters for HunterxHunter, exorcists for Jujutsu Kaisen, shinigami for Bleach As for sorcery, we could have chosen Fairy Tail, which honors mages, but the atmosphere is far from Harry Potter’s adventures. Black Clover, on the other hand, has everything of a shonen version of JK Rowling’s writings. Since the broadcast on October 2017 we follow Asta as a young orphan who likes to become the greatest magician in the kingdom (called Emperor-Mage). Unfortunately, he doesn’t have a remarkable predisposition unlike his friend Yuno, who clearly has a gifted talent for magic. The young boy crosses paths with an old grimoire with a three-leaf clover. Note that there’s a movie called Black Clover: Sword of the Wizard King, scheduled for March 31, 2023. More details of Crunchyroll.\nFlying Witch Makoto is an attractive young apprentice witch. She is only very problem–neither dizzy or so very atypical. Suffice not to say that acclimatization doesn’t sound easy for a young girl. Makoto has actually left Yokohama, but went to high school in northeastern Japan, obliterated, more precise, where his cousins have the locals Kei and Chinatsu. That’s a tradition of witches. At 15 years old they have to leave home to go to school. With the midst of an almost magical nature, Makoto tells us about his daily life – between learning and tenering the crazy things. Flying Witch is an in-fancy anime that takes a simple bite on a hungry stomach. Find Crunchyroll as well.\nIzetta: The last witch’s eyes were on the wall. The Last Witch (or Shumatsu no Izetta) is a world similar to World War II Europe, all with a little magic. We have a story from the story of Izetta, the last survivor of a witch clan. What about their particularity? You can manipulate any object that you touch. The princess of the principality of Eylstadt, Fine, will find Izetta in a strange capsule. That witch will wake up and save the princess for the first time. From there, she will swear by her loyalty to the latter and assure her protection and that of her country, threatened by the imperialist desires of Germany. Reviewed on Crunchyroll.\nMagi Madokes a magical girl. How do you talk about witchcraft and anime without mentioning at least one magical girl? You all know at least one example of magic girl, these works of young girls with magic powers like the Moon, the Hunt or the Doremi of Sakura. Today, our attention fell on the famous Puella Magi Madoka Magica. In 2011 this anime tells us the adventures of Madoka Kaname, a 13-year-old girl who totally has a life-changing relationship with Kyubey. This latter provides that she can become a Puella, but for that she has to sign a life contract. And who says she’s a Puella Magi, that’s how she lives, says she takes seriously risks in ridding the planet of unwelcome creatures that inhabit it. What is her choice? We let him discover it.\nRadiant Ankama, don’t you know? Dofus, Wakfu, Mutafukaz, probably but Radiant. You follow the adventures of Seth, a young apprentice sorcerer who a hard time catches on. His goal is to free the planet of terrible nemeses. The village of Pompe Hills was actually attacked by these creatures and he is one of the only ones who have survived. Seth, who taught Alma’s teachings, will take the path of the Radiant, the supposed nest of the Nemesis. But this task isn’t easy. Even since the inquisition is a group opposed to wizards, he’s behind his back and won’t hesitate to put on the speaking in his wheels. Can Seth annihilate the Nemesis and reconcile wizards and humans? Radiant will tell us. These are available on Crunchyroll and Netflix.\nThe ancient sexy groom was born on a mausoleum. We make the room change and leave the childish lines behind so we can draw closer to the look of a fairytale. Moreover, we are not confronted by a witch, rather than by a wizard who responds to Elias Ainsworth’s name. The latter paid dearly to offer a young teenager, Chise, a lot of money at a solitary auction. That if the latter is worth its weight in gold, it might be because it is une Slay Vega, a natural creature capable of attracting magic forces to themselves. Elias has two plans for her: to become his apprentice but also his wife. From learning magic to building a much normal family, The ancient Magus Bride is about to have a fascinating journey, both with moving and changing wings. Please note that season 2 will land in April 2023, which we will enjoy very much. Available on Crunchyroll.\nWandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina: The Journey of a man named Elaina. Do you want to go and study? You should take the journey of Elaina by Walking Witch. The anime, as mentioned in his name, shows the adventures of Elaina, a witch nicknamed the ash witch who decided to travel the world to find new populations and fantastic beasts. A reading the book of the witch Nike allowed her to follow the footsteps of her mother and learn magic. She did study hard and became the youngest person who ever took the witch exam. She even struggled to obtain an apprenticeship because she was an expert in the field. Luckily, Fran, Nikes former apprentice, took her under her wing.\nA witch hunter is a witch hunter. We change perspective with Witch Hunter Robin who takes us to the heart of the Solomon organization, responsible for hunting witches. It is split between several local subsidiaries. In Japan, it’s the STN-J, and the least we can say is they have their own way of working. There’s a chance that the members of Solomon kill witches, but the ones of STN-J use the technology to find all the bloodlines of witches and stop making magic a reality in the younger people. But the arrival of some news sent to replace the team who was murdered will turn everything upside down. Witch Hunter Robin is another view of witchcraft, and for that reason this 2002 anime deserved its place in our selection, which is difficult to find today.\nReleases by 2023. Masha If we did manage to easily understand Mashle, we could say it was a mix between Harry Potter and One Punch Man and My Hero Academia. We follow the adventures of Mash Burnedead, the young man living with the wizards. It is a good thing: He doesn’t have magic powers. She is her thing. But there is a way that isn’t accepted in a world like world where magic is everywhere. Worse yet, the absence of magic power can be punished by brutal killing. Mash has no other choice, he must join Eastons Magicakademie and become the New Goddess of Chosen. He can, now, use his physical skills to survive in this school worthy of Hogwarts. The anime is going to be canceled 2023.\nIceblade sorcerer can rule the world in a sandstorm. The Iceblade Sorcerer Shall Rule the World is a story from the Ray White story, which he sounded like a hoyeken no Majutsushi ga Sekai Wo Suberu. You can not be fooled by his childish looks. He’s a great soldier, not the best ever. He saved his country from destruction and obtained the title of Magician Iceblade, the hero known to everyone. He doesn’t really like his simplicity. Incognito, he’ll now enter the Arnold Academy to study the world of lambda magic. And even with Ray, nothing can be simple. The young person will actually find himself facing a conspiracy outside the school and could be forced to re-enforce the assault and make the face of his past. The anime series will premiere on January 6, 2023. It will happen on Crunchyroll with us. The wizards workshop will prepare you. We wanted to include in this list a really good version of the latelier des wizards, for which an anime is in preparation. To the contrary, we have not yet released the release date. The manga is extremely good and in some respects the look of Harry Potter. It deserves some parenthesis. So here’s her story, story? Coco was always fascinated by magic. But even if you practice this art, only the wizards can choose the chosen ones from the birth. One day, the wizard, Kieffrey, arrives in the girls’ village. Coco and others captured the true nature of magic by spying on him. She remembers the book and a inkwell she bought when she was a child. She is now in secret. But due to the ignorance of her, Coco commits a terrible act. When she’s done in this, she’s the disciple of Kieffrey and is going to discover a world of which she didn’t suspect the existence!\nBut, in addition to animated films like Disney, you can see from here, a few more. The Howls Moving Castle The smallest Witch’s Academy The Klutzy Witch is the only witch who is present in the burn of the witch.\n","wordCount":"1593","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-22T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Steven Ginkel"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/two-or-three-anime-is-even-more-magical-than-harry-potter/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Two Or Three Anime Is Even More Magical Than Harry Potter</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 22, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1593 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Steven Ginkel</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#animals-are-already-available>Animals are already available.</a><ul><li><a href=#black-clover>Black Clover</a></li><li><a href=#flying-witch>Flying Witch</a></li><li><a href=#izetta-the-last-witchs-eyes-were-on-the-wall>Izetta: The last witch’s eyes were on the wall.</a></li><li><a href=#magi-madokes-a-magical-girl>Magi Madokes a magical girl.</a></li><li><a href=#radiant>Radiant</a></li><li><a href=#the-ancient-sexy-groom-was-born-on-a-mausoleum>The ancient sexy groom was born on a mausoleum.</a></li><li><a href=#wandering-witch-the-journey-of-elaina-the-journey-of-a-man-named-elaina>Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina: The Journey of a man named Elaina.</a></li><li><a href=#a-witch-hunter-is-a-witch-hunter>A witch hunter is a witch hunter.</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#releases-by-2023>Releases by 2023.</a><ul><li><a href=#masha>Masha</a></li><li><a href=#iceblade-sorcerer-can-rule-the-world-in-a-sandstorm>Iceblade sorcerer can rule the world in a sandstorm.</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#but-in-addition-to-animated-films-like-disney-you-can-see-from-here-a-few-more>But, in addition to animated films like Disney, you can see from here, a few more.</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Published on 27/12/2022 at 20:05.
