The result was an elite group of developers finally getting the chance to avent their biggest dreams to a realist, as they all could at that time. You know what two of the best games on this list will be, but looking at the best PS2 RPGs will remind you just how deep this roster of all-time great titles really is.\n15. The Lord of the Rings: Threeth age. One hand, I feel a little bad putting this game on the list of titles that are a bit more critically acclaimed, a bit more innovative, and in some cases perhaps even better than the final Fantasy X-based title named EAs Lord of the Rings. On the contrary, there is something to say for the third age gives us the real RPG, The Lord of the Rings, in a time when the films remain the latest thing in the world. This strange mix of film scenes and original storytelling gave fans the chance to learn how to live in Middle-Earth again. The game holds up to now as a great way to relive your movie memories.\n14. Shin Shitani I: nocturnes. This incredible postapoapocalyptic RPG sees you play as a high school student who is determined to navigate a demon-filled version of Tokyo so that he can battle the forces that huddle over it. Here’s a bit odd, but I should say. Although this game is fundamental weirdness and not to be confused with its charm, the bigger draw here is nocturnes weak combat and demon recruitment mechanics. There’s a lot of depth and great creativity for this vast adventure – that doesn’t go far enough to forgive its punishing effects, a tense devastation and occasional irregularness.\n13. Radiata Stories Some criticize the Radiata stories, because it took them too long to click or just simply not to grab them. To be honest, I really feel right about this matter. This is a more relaxed, slow-moving game. It doesn’t just work for everyone. Yet I’ll always respect that game’s NPCs. Even though it allows over 176 NPCs to learn their own stories and capabilities, this game is a simply brilliant effort to keep people on top of their lives. Those who love the epic will not want to play it again.\n12. Symphonian tales are a story of history. A GameCube RPG often is remembered as Tale of Symphonia. However, this brilliant titles final PS2 feature makes it absolutely necessary for a conversation about these consoles best role-playing experiences. Tales of Symphonias art style and engaging story appeal to a worldly culture of the arts, but this is a good thing: this great empire is great. Tales of the Symphonian incredible battles fall somewhere between strategy game and RPG, but you will almost certainly keep you engaged from beginning to end with a very simple approach that few other genre titles can truly rival.\n11. The X-Men Legends II: An Apocalypse in the Wind. The PS2s collection of very good ARPGs deserves a lot more than they usually are, but what better way to kick off those overdue festivities than talk about this amazing X-Men game that sets standard and even modern superhero games are still chasing? This huge roster of playable characters that can be upgraded with gear and XP is certainly its biggest draw. But the way these games capture the feeling that each of us assemble the perfect team of characters and then have their fight against evil foes is something that puts this incredibly deep experience above the lesser imitators we’ve seen over the years.\n10. Kingdom Hearts 2:1 o’clock. I think that Kingdom Hears is a franchise. This dream project that somehow even so far beyond our wildest dreams could have reached its height with the brilliant Kingdom Hearts 2. These games worlds, bosses and storylines rank well among the best in this series, but the way all of these things make this one of the absolute most memorable games of this time.\n9. Quest VIII: An adventure of the gruesome King. If you’d knocked that Quest VIII, it’d probably be these sequels akin to its predecessors tropes and ideas. This isn’t the most innovative RPG in history. Then again, because you built upon the franchise that helped define JRPGs, it was hard to blame you for sticking with all of this for everything. This is an epic, expertly-designed JRPG experience, and is also popular with PS2.\nRead more Games\nFinal Fantasy was really the first JRPG? Byrd, Matthew. Games\n25 Great RPGs have been made ever. Byrd Matthew Byrd: “History is what lies behind us.”\n8. Next to the story, Xenosaga Episode I The Wille Zur Macht sagt. The word, that I usually hear often is often used to describe Xenosaga a deep word. It’s certainly a better description than the complicated tag that the RPG often assigns, but truth is that there is no better way to tell this story with a word or two. Xenosaga is an exam of the human condition that somehow manages to make use of the most intimate concepts across a galaxy-spanning adventure that feels like a swarm of all kinds of RPGs of this generation. I really like these games, like combat and character systems, but its Xenosagas interesting narrative isn’t really clear of me.\n7. Grandia II Grandia is the best RPG, since it is one of the most powerful movies released by Dreamcast. However, it wouldn’t surprise me if the games PS2 port manages to secure a decent position also in this list. From its real-time battle system with almost RTS-like movement restrictions to its war-torn world, populated with memorable characters and plots, Grandia II checks so many of the JRPGs genre’s best boxes, and gives it a big personal identity.\n6. Shadow Hearts: Covenant. As a Lovecraftian horror RPG in one of the new versions of WW1, Shadow Hearts: Covenant is one of those RPGs that is capable of selling itself by virtue of its core concepts and the back of the box description. With the help of many other games we talk about on this list, you ought to experience Shadow Hearts for yourself so you understand its depth. From the ingenious Judgement Ring that dictates most of the combat to the different parts of the Sanity Meter to the underlying horror elements, Shadow Hearts is a bold swing at a number of brilliant ideas that overshadow its stumbles.\n5. Dark Cloud 2 is a dark cloud. I don’t think that Dark Cloud 2 would be the only one that does have all the more traditional RPG elements, so I can’t say that it would still likely find somewhere on this list. There is no excuse not to admire this games ARPG battle, narrative, and characters, both for their unique charms and the way they imagined certain concepts that are much more common today. Even the Dark Cloud 2s time traveling and world-building systems really set it apart. Building a better world and having the ability to look past and see the benefits of your designs is one of the most incredible concepts that certainly could be replicated if it weren’t so complex.\n4. Persona 4 The Persona series has long won nearly universal acclaim for its bizarre narrative concepts, sense of style, and ability to translate the most outstanding abstract concepts into absolutely compelling gameplay sequences. This game has a lot of fun, and it’s not surprising that almost everyone is using its inventive design to play it. Persona 4 reexamines almost every aspect of the JRPG genre so that they look fresh again and pay full respect to the spirit they made themselves. The level of the ability to succeed in this genre is a striking testament, too.\n3. Final Fantasy X takes place in the final. It was growing sense that in the weeks and months preceding Final Fantasy X’s release, it was the real sense that this was going to be PS2’s first successful system, and, as well, a significant new Final Fantasy game that could very well rival Final Fantasy 7 in terms of its impact. I think Final Fantasy X will meet all the hype. Final Fantasy X is worth the money and a few key things in the world. As with all things – Final Fantasy is often the most comfortable way to recommend to those curious why this is the RPG series that has seen many different generations and so many changes in the genre, so that it will be easier to say why there is a whole lot more work to do.\n2. The Gate of the Baldurs: A Dark Alliance. I mentioned that the PS2 included some incredible ARPGs that don’t always get the love they deserve. Well, Dark Alliance should be considered the star of this particular category. Even if you’d rather look at Dark Alliance than a Diablo knock-off, it would probably rank top of the list of the best entries in that somewhat odd subgenre. Yet it’s an easy way to tell the truth about how this game is not only accessible to console players, it’s also reimagining it in one of the most entertaining co-op games ever dedicated to any platform.\n1. Final Fantasy XII is final Fantasy a complete victory. Final Fantasy XII was praised after a strong performance, but it was always the same if it entered the famed franchise. Some criticised the huge changes in the Final Fantasy formula (which was only recently reinvented in Final Fantasy X), while others criticised smaller aspects of the game like its music, writing and characters. In truth, there’s a lot of debate at this time. As time passes, my respect for Final Fantasy XII has only grown. The bold Gambit system that is more accessible and common now than it was when this game launched and the way it makes its overworld look much more significant than other FF games, this game is not just perfect for the soul of the franchise and it is capable of realizing the whole spirit of the whole project without knowing the laurels of a whole game. Of course, speaking about that game without being mentioned, isn’t it? Is it one of those best stories in this franchise’s history? That game is just a triumph, a frightening triumph.\n","wordCount":"1769","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Brenda Wagner"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/15-best-playstation-2-rpgs-ever-and-now-that-you-have-15-most-cherished-ones/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>15 Best Playstation 2 Rpgs Ever And Now That You Have 15 Most Cherished Ones</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 1, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1769 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Brenda Wagner</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#15-the-lord-of-the-rings-threeth-age>15.

Dark Cloud 2 is a dark cloud.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#5-dark-cloud-2-is-a-dark-cloud>#</a></h2><p>I don’t think that Dark Cloud 2 would be the only one that does have all the more traditional RPG elements, so I can’t say that it would still likely find somewhere on this list. There is no excuse not to admire this games ARPG battle, narrative, and characters, both for their unique charms and the way they imagined certain concepts that are much more common today.
Even the Dark Cloud 2s time traveling and world-building systems really set it apart. Building a better world and having the ability to look past and see the benefits of your designs is one of the most incredible concepts that certainly could be replicated if it weren’t so complex.</p><h2 id=4-persona-4>4. Persona 4<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#4-persona-4>#</a></h2><p>The Persona series has long won nearly universal acclaim for its bizarre narrative concepts, sense of style, and ability to translate the most outstanding abstract concepts into absolutely compelling gameplay sequences.
This game has a lot of fun, and it’s not surprising that almost everyone is using its inventive design to play it. Persona 4 reexamines almost every aspect of the JRPG genre so that they look fresh again and pay full respect to the spirit they made themselves. The level of the ability to succeed in this genre is a striking testament, too.</p><h2 id=3-final-fantasy-x-takes-place-in-the-final>3. Final Fantasy X takes place in the final.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-final-fantasy-x-takes-place-in-the-final>#</a></h2><p>It was growing sense that in the weeks and months preceding Final Fantasy X’s release, it was the real sense that this was going to be PS2’s first successful system, and, as well, a significant new Final Fantasy game that could very well rival Final Fantasy 7 in terms of its impact.
I think Final Fantasy X will meet all the hype. Final Fantasy X is worth the money and a few key things in the world. As with all things – Final Fantasy is often the most comfortable way to recommend to those curious why this is the RPG series that has seen many different generations and so many changes in the genre, so that it will be easier to say why there is a whole lot more work to do.</p><h2 id=2-the-gate-of-the-baldurs-a-dark-alliance>2. The Gate of the Baldurs: A Dark Alliance.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-the-gate-of-the-baldurs-a-dark-alliance>#</a></h2><p>I mentioned that the PS2 included some incredible ARPGs that don’t always get the love they deserve. Well, Dark Alliance should be considered the star of this particular category.
Even if you’d rather look at Dark Alliance than a Diablo knock-off, it would probably rank top of the list of the best entries in that somewhat odd subgenre. Yet it’s an easy way to tell the truth about how this game is not only accessible to console players, it’s also reimagining it in one of the most entertaining co-op games ever dedicated to any platform.</p><h2 id=1-final-fantasy-xii-is-final-fantasy-a-complete-victory>1. Final Fantasy XII is final Fantasy a complete victory.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-final-fantasy-xii-is-final-fantasy-a-complete-victory>#</a></h2><p>Final Fantasy XII was praised after a strong performance, but it was always the same if it entered the famed franchise. Some criticised the huge changes in the Final Fantasy formula (which was only recently reinvented in Final Fantasy X), while others criticised smaller aspects of the game like its music, writing and characters. In truth, there’s a lot of debate at this time.
As time passes, my respect for Final Fantasy XII has only grown. The bold Gambit system that is more accessible and common now than it was when this game launched and the way it makes its overworld look much more significant than other FF games, this game is not just perfect for the soul of the franchise and it is capable of realizing the whole spirit of the whole project without knowing the laurels of a whole game.
Of course, speaking about that game without being mentioned, isn’t it? Is it one of those best stories in this franchise’s history? That game is just a triumph, a frightening triumph.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/101-pool-rummy-guide-how-to-play-rules-for-101-pool-rummy-in-2020/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>101 Pool Rummy Guide How To Play Rules For 101 Pool Rummy In 2020</span></a>
