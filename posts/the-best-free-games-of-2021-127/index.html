Nevertheless, there are still plenty of great free-to-play games, as well as mobile games. Of course there isn’t really a free game. For example, if you use the gacha monetization model, some games are easier to learn with the free or low-rearity characters, while others are more dependent on the high-damage characters of the paid gacha system. Even in every gacha game, many games have full free content; the only half of all gacha players spend cash. This year I spent $50 on the Fate/Grand Order, and around 90 dollars on the Genshin Impact. While I wasn’t employed, I didn’t spend any money. These aren’t games that you can finish in a month. They tend to be games you can live with in the long run, since they constantly add new stories and challenges. I don’t see playing free-to-play games as a huge force for me, because they’re in direct competition with other games, but as a space where different kinds of creativity and innovation can flourish. Here are some of the best free-to-play titles I have ever tried.\nGenshin Impact The action-game RPG was successful in the last year and continues to enjoy regular updates for seasonal events, quality-of-life changes and general quest content. A fan community, inspired by the fast evolution of the game, is constantly making use of the fanworks and the content of online communication. But it’s not just the community who constantly pushes Genshin to the forefront. This unique combat give the game enormous power. For Gacha, powercraft usually has big problems. By adding more powerful characters to the library of available fighters, older characters generally become less relevant in the meta. If a playbase has invested enormous sums of money, resources and money into it, this can be a real problem. Although Genshin isn’t the only one to keep an older character from being powercrept, he added new characters and weapons that can improve their teammates’ potential. Raiden Shogun revived the entire electro-metal in an energy-focused kit. And the addition of the Low-Rarity Gorou revitalized interest in older geo characters like Noelle and Ningguang, who have been in the game since the beginning. Instead of competing with other characters for one or two best metastacks, each new character may raise the value of their potential rivals. This formula is incredibly clever so that Genshin won’t be worth playing for years to come.\nArknights For all of you looking for free-to-play gacha games, the tower defense game Arknights is the easiest one to recommend. Almost everything is available without premium currency, and poor rarity is as good as a harder subject. For unlucky players, YouTubers like KyoStinV and Eckogen use low-rarity guides to clear game content a lot. In Arknights, your characters strategically are positioned so that they can defeat enemies before they can get your home base on the ground. Each character has a specific niche in the meta, and the game regularly releases new types of challenge maps to keep each niche relevant. Some characters are great for blocking foes. Others have assassins, or they are good at a quick-drop attack. There is virtually no single strategy that is applied to a few hard maps. If you’ve always wanted to watch games like Fire Emblem, you’d better pick the ones who have fun in Arknights. In short, high level promotions can help reduce their losses and reduce the cost of being involved. Don’t worry if you have never played a tower defense game. Game development is great. The story is compelling and intangible to the subject of moral confusion. Arknights is a game I can recommend to anyone who enjoys anime, real-time strategy or narrative games.\nAlchemy Stars This team-based strategy game was the greatest hit of 2021. Alchemy Stars has beautiful character art, the best mobile games soundtrack, and a fun turn-based combat system. Your character moves on a grid-based map, and you match a color and color to execute special combinations. Do you give priority to attacking multiple enemies at the same time? Do you focus your attacks on one boss? Do you run or hit? Do you take over enemy range to execute several devastating combat combos next turn? Alchemy Stars gameplay is easy to master, but still hard to play. The game is often updated. I can’t remember a single lull in which there wasn’t an ongoing event. The story is accurate, and I’d better put it on the same level as Arknights. Nevertheless, Alchemy Stars also suffers from localization problems. The translations make it easier for me to understand the story, but I wish they were more elegantly localized. If the story isn’t the best dealbreaker for you, Alchemy Stars is one of the best strategy games on your mobile device.\nFate/Milder’s Orders. The Fate/Grand Order is the most widely used visual novel game in the world, and from the ground up is its most common feature. The IP is one of the most ambitious multiverse software. In one chapter, Oosmandias plays a good game against a female King Arthur. In another, Brynhildr and Sigurd are collaborating with Napoleon Bonaparte. Joan of Arc is threatening her evil twin. There are no historical figures or mythological legends that are sacred. To be in the Fate universe, everything works with brilliant storytelling and with a sense of humor. When Francis Drake began to go pink as a pirate, I nodded and thought, OK. In a first story, players alternated the ancient Rome, the mythological Okeanos, the Victorian London, Colonial America, Jerusalem and Babylon. In the second arc, players explored some quite strange versions of Russia, Sweden, and China. The developers released the first quests for India and Atlantis this year. Is this the only problem? Before you can play either of the two of them, you must finish almost five million words of story. The gameplay is easy with a turn-based combat system, but with a changing meta. The main problem with F/GO is that it has probably the most impolite gacha system of all games. I can’t recommend it to beginners and players who have difficult gacha systems. I highly recommend to try the other games on this list before trying F/GO. If you get past the grubby of the six-year-old game, you will find that it has some of the best visuals in video games. The end of many chapters is most emotionally devastating (if not more).\nTears of Themis. Tears of Themis is a cross between a dating game and a court game. You represent clients accused of murder, who were involved in various litigation. Together, you get close friends with four young men, like in an otome game. If you aren’t pulling for characters like you do in most gacha games, then you’re pulling for cards of the male leads. The story takes the form of oral debates, in which you play different cards to gain control over opponents arguments. I started playing Tears of themis this month. It worked a very nice and relaxed way to spend time between live service games. The art is spectacular, the card game is easy to play, and the mysteries are good written. I don’t really want to snore at dating in my own mind. So when you look like it, I like to solve the whodunnits and the mini-dramas. I have played online romance apps, and Tears of Themis is a popular game. You’re interested in playing mobile otome games. Here’s a game that you should play.\n","wordCount":"1280","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-10T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michael Ramos"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/the-best-free-games-of-2021-127/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>The Best Free Games Of 2021 127</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 10, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1280 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Michael Ramos</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#genshin-impact>Genshin Impact</a></li><li><a href=#arknights>Arknights</a></li><li><a href=#alchemy-stars>Alchemy Stars</a></li><li><a href=#fatemilders-orders>Fate/Milder’s Orders.</a></li><li><a href=#tears-of-themis>Tears of Themis.</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>You may have seen me write many of Genshin Impact blogs around here, but that’s certainly a free-to-play game that I think is outstanding and worthy of a lot of coverage.
