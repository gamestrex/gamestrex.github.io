BASIC ATTACK\n37 + 1,5/Lvl (+20% of your Magical Power) 1.25/1.25/1.25 damage and swing time, while hitting in an AoE on final blow.\nPASSIVE THE COMPANY.\nAs Atlas does or takes god damage, he accumulates an additional 1,25 cubic feet of energy in his Astrolabe. The mine is capable of giving 1/10th of the energy. When he makes 20 Energy his next Basic Attack has 1.5x damage, 1.5s swing time, and more bonus damage will be done inside a zone. The deads are scrambled with the dead, and the deads are stunned. Atlas can store up to 30 kWh of Energy. Boost : 8 * The amount of damage is an absolute bonus.\nUNBURDEN\nAtlas orbits his Astrolabe to a target location, damaging and slowing the enemies where it lands. While he was deployed, his Basic Attack will cause a catastrophic damage to every enemy. This explosion is destroying the Minions and costing five Mana to use. After 5 or when he refires this ability, the Astrolabe will return to him. Atlas second ability is different depending on whether his Astrolabe is deployed or held. Ability : Grasse your inner circle. 30% damage (40% of your Magical Power) Slow: 10/12.5/15/17.5/20% Very slow and fast: 2s. Basic Explosion: 23+ 6 Per Level. Freespot : 15/14.5.14.13s. Cost: 65/70/75/80/85 Mana.\nGRAVITY PULL\nAtlas axes his enemies toward his Astrolabe. The enemy gods who are too close get caught in the Astrolabe. If Atlas holds the Astrolabe, aliens who get held into the Astrolabe get hold of it in front of Atlas. After a short delay, the targeted targets will get on to the direction outlined by Atlas. If Atlas threw the Astrolabe, enemies who get pulled into the Astrolabe will be held at the location of the Astrolabe before going towards the destination of the Astrolabes. Ability: Cone / Certifying. Your Magical Power is 35 percent worth of damage from half of the pounds. Charge: 50/80/110/140/170 (35 % of your Magical Power). Cooldown: 16s. Cost: 50/55/60/65/70 Mana.\nKINETIC CHARGE\nAtlas charges forward. Every allied god he charges near will have their burdens removed, removing them from the current slow and increasing their movement speed. When Atlas collides with an enemy god he leaves the burdens in an explosion. Upon each burden accumulated the slow increase by 25 %, up to 75 %. 0 – See – Please line up. Damage: 80/135/190/245/300 (+45% of your Magical Power). Motion Speed: 25/27.5/30/32.5/35%! Cooldown: 16. Cost : 60/65/70/75/80 Mana : 70,50 lbh.\nGAMMA-RAY BURST WORKS, RUISSES.\nAtlas pierced the sky as deep and rang out a gamma-ray burst. In this area, in-emies are hit every 0.5s and gain radiation. Radiation can sometimes pass 5/5/650 times and reduce the enemy’s Protections and Power. The Gamma-Ray-Darst, after 5s or on re-fire, will concentrate in power and begin to travel across the battlefield. Enemies whose pulsed ray damage take greater damage and gain Focused Radiation, lowering Protection and Power equal to 3 stacks of Radiation. Ability : Circle : Circle : Damage: 25/35/45/55/65 (+10% of your Magical Power). Protection Reduction : 5% of the damage is the damage. Power reduction: 2 % – a small difference. Focused Damage : 100/145/190/235/280 (+40 percent of Magical Power) The cooldown : 90s yen. – 60/70/80/90/100 Mana.\nEVENTS\nWelcome to Yulefest! In this most fun and cozy time, this event celebrates many friendships. In total, there will be 6 exclusive, purchasable Skins, 2 releasing each two weeks. A discount of 25% will apply to every skin when it receives that offer. Do not forget to participate in the quest, especially if you want more rewards! The simple form of the body that came from the Yulefest event will give you a little helper Bastet Skin and 6 skins will give you all the infinite infinite Oracle Morgan Le Fay Skin! For a birthday mug for Yulefest, you will receive a gift card of a certain type, like “Emote, Voice Pack, Tier 2 Skin”, or “Aided Gift”. Gift Tokens allow you to send gift from a friend on your friends list, in the gift store, or even make a new friend by giving a gift from the end of match lobby to a terrific teammate. Send gifts to your friends this season and spread the joy of friendship!\nBurning Desire, aphrodite. The gigantic Sol is the highest-ever of the time. Cyberblade Amaterasu Hachiman, a wooded hunter, is the night’s night. Plushie Raijin Hazel socks are the same number of people who are slender.\nLittle helper Bastet shammer. An incomplete Oracle Morgan Le Faysaa must be revealed.\nLIFE FOLLOWS QUALITY.\nCustom Games Added a new Duel game that would utilize the specific map rules such as Titan and BDK HP changes in custom games. Add new range-based Bans to the ranked Conquest system. Leaderboards They fixed numerous issues with tabletop: Leaderboards aren’t loading in loads. Two double names can be seen. Don’t be able to promote to grandmaster, to not promote him. There were even a lot of changes for how many players are visible on the leaderboard at the same time. It will show a more narrow range around your progress and will remove inactive players from the leaderboards. There may be changes in leaderboards in the future. This was completed during the update, and will go live for testing in the wake of the patches, which were completed on Tuesday 11-24. If there are unintended consequences, the changes could be temporarily reverted and adjusted for 8.12. Ranked MMR Fixed an issue where players sometimes earned 0 MMR for a win. The player won’t be able to earn 0 MMR for a win, even if the MMR difference is vast, the winner still gains a lot of MMR. All Ban System Ranked Conquest System. When they first load, they will see what will go into planning. The text of the left over will be in order to say a word. The planning phase for first pick is in preparation for the process. Prepare the second round of planning with plans. Matchmaking. Children under thirty years old, can play under the age of 30. For Conquest, Arena, and Joust, the lorry will be used. Player level 1- 4th. From two AI bots: the co-op and the co-op will be routed. Players level 5 Will be routed to a new in pvp queue, not only accessible to players of this level, but also accessible to this level’s players of this level. Players of 30 to 160 levels. We’ll be routed to normal pvp queues. There’s two main consequences. It is no longer possible for players 2 and 29 to be in lobbies with those 30+. The only exception would be to party with an additional 30 player. Only one player at thirty+ brings the entire party into the thirty+ queue. They are going to join a new queue of players now having their MMR effectively reset when they hit level 30. The new players will be entering a new queue.\nBUG FIXES\nFixed a problem where if you lock in the god who owns your voice, whichever icon you pick the most breaks your tabs and the other tabs don’t.\nFixed a problem where several jungle camps could lose their weight by bodyblocking them with pets.\nCliodhna Fixed an issue that had her ability 2 self buff last longer than she intended to death a god decoy. Raijin Fixed an issue where his combat anim was playing in a runny direction, but had to put his side on hand with his fight anim.\nThe Nemean Lion: Hide of the Nemean Lion. Fixed a problem where this item didn’t stack any as intended.\nBALANCE LIVE WITH the TITAN OF THE COSMOS UPDATE.\nSWC Conquest This Winter Conquest map will help you prepare for the Smite World Championships. The Pyromancer can see the Thors Hammer Trophy. SWC logo is engraved on the stutter at Mid Lane. Maps show statues honouring world champion god skins.\nIt’s difficult for everybody to agree on the right type of balance. Whats happening at their pro levels, that is about the ranking factor and the casual factor. Our own research shows that Mages have seen a large chunk of their overall damage in the adolescence of class. The boots have improved dramatically, especially with a mix of tanky and bruising play styles. Since then we’ve adjusted all the class but mages. We saw Warrior starter items get power early and then became Core Assassin items. In this update we are adding a little power to some mage items that focus on Penetration and other issues that are supporting them. This should make us more popular on Worlds than traditional DPS. ENCHANTED SPEAR\nMagical Power will be expanded from 40 to 60.\nPERSONAL DESOLATIONS DEVENDANTS – PERSONAL SELFS.\nPower Magical Increased from 110 to 120.\nSPELL FOCUS\nExpanded Magical Power from 45 to 55.\nOBSIDIAN SHARD\nMagical Power went from 80 to 90.\nBOOK HOUNDS.\nThe magical power is increased from 55 to 65 m.\nBOOK OF DEAD!\nThe sensibility of the passive between 30% and 25% of the maximum mana.\nDAY OF THOSEING. There are a few starter items that are unpopular in the present meta, and this tree is one of them. We’re increasing the regen while in the jungle as well as upgrading the stats on the upgrade to stand out with the two other Jungler Starter items.\nHP5 in jungle, from fifteen to 20, is increased from 15 to 20. In the jungle, it is 5 MP5, which is grown from 10 to 15 years old.\nA PROTECTOR OF GNUEL-YELLOWERS\nIncreased Attack Speed from 25 to 35%.\nTERRA When Terra’s ability to backfire Crushing Earth when Crushing Earth was cdored, she also refires by dashing it. That allowed him to re-fire and shatter the ability at the same time, effectively detonating it twice. In the short run, this feature walked the line between bug or emergent mechanic, but after seeing her performance in the live matches and SPL over multiple months we determined this effect is too strong, and Terra will have to choose between re-fire or shatter. CRUSHING EARTH\nThat skill can only be re-fired or shattered, and not at the same time both at the same time.\nBELLONA There’s a fair share of love in warriors who have been to the sword, but there’s no way Bellona could find the spot in the solo section. She is a big hit with her utilities, but she seems to struggle out of the gate in the street. We increase the base damage on Scourge to prevent that she can clear lanes with success, especially against gods who don’t budgeon. SCOURGE\nAn additional 220 dollars dommage was incurred between 80 and 150.\nGANESHA That peaceful god is ready to go back to the battleground. Ganesha has unique condition, which a means of CC is given in his channeled silence. To be sure that his peel lasts the intended duration of time, we provide him with knockback immunity. It should not be necessary to interrupt the reading by immediately noticing the results. OHM\nGanesha is no longer immune to a knock-back condition while channeling this ability.\nVAMANA In recent years we have not seen Vamana, and it is certainly not because of his height. This aggressive solo laner seemed to just need too much stuff to find a perfect build that works for her. He also takes good control of attack, and moves, but he doesn’t have to stay so fluid. We are changing his passive to help him find everything he needs to succeed. SLEEPING GIANT\nTo convert the passive 10% of Vamanas Physical Protection to % Attack Speed. One of the best examples is the 100 Physical Protections that offer a 10 per cent speed at the attacks.\nRATATOSKR The boots stayed, Ratatoskr couldn’t buy them (they simply couldn’t fit) but still deserves compensation for the loss. Acorns of a century were designed to give a fit to the footspace of a build, but now that builds don’t have a boots item in them, we would like the Acorns to more closely fit the stats of a three-tier item. There are some acorns seeing stat increases to help with that, with a little more stats going to the Acorns that are currently the least successful. EVERGREEN ACORN\nIncreased strength of your hands from 25 to 35.\nTHICKBARK ACORN\nAdded strength 35 from 25-35 to 25.\nBRISTLEBUSH ACORN\nExpanded Physical Power to 35-45. He increased the bonus of batatoskr in order to protect against a god with Dart by three years of physical lifesteal and one-third of basic attacks to 15 %.\nTHISTLETHORN ACORN\nIncreased physical power from 45 to 50, according to science.\nMERCURY The fastest god has gotten faster than his predecessor. When Mercury uses his Made Ya Look skills, he actually sprints to another location to a target and then reloads his shot. Well now he can do that by the wall, without any more abilities. Don’t ask us how, but Mercury should be a life-saving act of fighting for more targets in the jungle. MANY YEARS ATTEND TO YA!\nNow can be fired by walls?\nNEITH Fate has not favored the goddess. He got a few promotions earlier this year that seemed promising and we saw a glimpse of Neith at the competitive level and then she slipped off. We have two buffs on her today to try to bring her back. Their passive weaves have been going to last two times longer, allowing Neiths to better lay out deployables for future advantages. We also give an extra damage boost to help her laning and 1v1. BROKEN WEAVE\nLonger Weave time, from 1m to 2m.\nUNRAVEL\nMore damage to the ground up from 70/100/130/160/190 to 70/110/150/190/230.\nJING WEI Oh, sigh! Now is the time to show some Judahi buffs. The evasive goddess was a squatter of overheating, which screamed her ability to return to the pro meta as a result of his ability to make the pro meta at any moment, especially when the stakes were high. There are other safe hunters in the contest that will compete with Jing Wei now, so it appears like the perfect time for a buff. Explosive Bolts are improving their effects when they aren’t online. We’re also having to reduce mana costs to improve his car’s lane phase. EXPLOSIVE BOLTS\nThe damage per shot increased from 100% to 1200%. These include targets also hit by the explosion. Fixed the problem with her ability screen that displayed incorrect Basic Attack information when Explosive Bolts became active.\nPERSISTENT GUST\nMana cost increased from 60/70/80 to 60/65/70/75/80.\nAIR STRIKE\nDecreased Mana Cost from 100-110/120/130/140 to 80-90/100/120/120/120/120/180/160/160/120/140/120/120/115/100/180/120/120/130/140/80/120/120/180/130/120/120/120/140/100/190/100/120/120/100/120/100/100/120/120/110/120/120/100/120/110/120/\nMEDUSA Don’t be looking at her right away, but it’s finally the long-awaited community request for Medusa. This famous goddess has a fantastic kit that never reached the competitive height of the world. In this update, she is going to be a more effective anti-healing god, and that makes her journey faster – and thereby be able to damage minions! ACID SPRAY\nNow applies Healing Reduction equal to 50% for 4s.\nLACERATE\nThey’re not using healing. Now slammed with coins as Medusa travels through them.\nAN NON-SKIN VOICE ACTORS CANADA.\nThe book was published. Burning Desire Aphrodite:Misty Lee. Is there anything to do? Infinite Oracle Morgan Le Fay:Tifane Williams:Tifane Williams. Her husband: Shealey Van Sistine: Shealey Van Sistine:Natalie. Naga, noxious Mina:Vanessa Lemonides:. Iroh Bacchus:Cory Yee.

The mine is capable of giving 1/10th of the energy. When he makes 20 Energy his next Basic Attack has 1.5x damage, 1.5s swing time, and more bonus damage will be done inside a zone. The deads are scrambled with the dead, and the deads are stunned. Atlas can store up to 30 kWh of Energy. Boost : 8 * The amount of damage is an absolute bonus.</p><p>UNBURDEN</p><p>Atlas orbits his Astrolabe to a target location, damaging and slowing the enemies where it lands. While he was deployed, his Basic Attack will cause a catastrophic damage to every enemy. This explosion is destroying the Minions and costing five Mana to use. After 5 or when he refires this ability, the Astrolabe will return to him. Atlas second ability is different depending on whether his Astrolabe is deployed or held. Ability : Grasse your inner circle. 30% damage (40% of your Magical Power) Slow: 10/12.5/15/17.5/20% Very slow and fast: 2s. Basic Explosion: 23+ 6 Per Level. Freespot : 15/14.5.14.13s. Cost: 65/70/75/80/85 Mana.</p><p>GRAVITY PULL</p><p>Atlas axes his enemies toward his Astrolabe. The enemy gods who are too close get caught in the Astrolabe. If Atlas holds the Astrolabe, aliens who get held into the Astrolabe get hold of it in front of Atlas. After a short delay, the targeted targets will get on to the direction outlined by Atlas. If Atlas threw the Astrolabe, enemies who get pulled into the Astrolabe will be held at the location of the Astrolabe before going towards the destination of the Astrolabes. Ability: Cone / Certifying. Your Magical Power is 35 percent worth of damage from half of the pounds. Charge: 50/80/110/140/170 (35 % of your Magical Power). Cooldown: 16s. Cost: 50/55/60/65/70 Mana.</p><p>KINETIC CHARGE</p><p>Atlas charges forward. Every allied god he charges near will have their burdens removed, removing them from the current slow and increasing their movement speed. When Atlas collides with an enemy god he leaves the burdens in an explosion. Upon each burden accumulated the slow increase by 25 %, up to 75 %. 0 – See – Please line up. Damage: 80/135/190/245/300 (+45% of your Magical Power). Motion Speed: 25/27.5/30/32.5/35%! Cooldown: 16. Cost : 60/65/70/75/80 Mana : 70,50 lbh.</p><p>GAMMA-RAY BURST WORKS, RUISSES.</p><p>Atlas pierced the sky as deep and rang out a gamma-ray burst. In this area, in-emies are hit every 0.5s and gain radiation. Radiation can sometimes pass 5/5/650 times and reduce the enemy’s Protections and Power. The Gamma-Ray-Darst, after 5s or on re-fire, will concentrate in power and begin to travel across the battlefield. Enemies whose pulsed ray damage take greater damage and gain Focused Radiation, lowering Protection and Power equal to 3 stacks of Radiation. Ability : Circle : Circle : Damage: 25/35/45/55/65 (+10% of your Magical Power). Protection Reduction : 5% of the damage is the damage. Power reduction: 2 % – a small difference. Focused Damage : 100/145/190/235/280 (+40 percent of Magical Power) The cooldown : 90s yen. – 60/70/80/90/100 Mana.</p><p>EVENTS</p><p>Welcome to Yulefest!

Cyberblade Amaterasu Hachiman, a wooded hunter, is the night’s night. Plushie Raijin Hazel socks are the same number of people who are slender.</p><p>Little helper Bastet shammer. An incomplete Oracle Morgan Le Faysaa must be revealed.</p><p>LIFE FOLLOWS QUALITY.</p><p>Custom Games Added a new Duel game that would utilize the specific map rules such as Titan and BDK HP changes in custom games. Add new range-based Bans to the ranked Conquest system. Leaderboards They fixed numerous issues with tabletop: Leaderboards aren’t loading in loads. Two double names can be seen. Don’t be able to promote to grandmaster, to not promote him. There were even a lot of changes for how many players are visible on the leaderboard at the same time. It will show a more narrow range around your progress and will remove inactive players from the leaderboards. There may be changes in leaderboards in the future. This was completed during the update, and will go live for testing in the wake of the patches, which were completed on Tuesday 11-24. If there are unintended consequences, the changes could be temporarily reverted and adjusted for 8.12. Ranked MMR Fixed an issue where players sometimes earned 0 MMR for a win. The player won’t be able to earn 0 MMR for a win, even if the MMR difference is vast, the winner still gains a lot of MMR. All Ban System Ranked Conquest System. When they first load, they will see what will go into planning. The text of the left over will be in order to say a word. The planning phase for first pick is in preparation for the process. Prepare the second round of planning with plans. Matchmaking. Children under thirty years old, can play under the age of 30. For Conquest, Arena, and Joust, the lorry will be used. Player level 1- 4th. From two AI bots: the co-op and the co-op will be routed. Players level 5 Will be routed to a new in pvp queue, not only accessible to players of this level, but also accessible to this level’s players of this level. Players of 30 to 160 levels. We’ll be routed to normal pvp queues. There’s two main consequences. It is no longer possible for players 2 and 29 to be in lobbies with those 30+. The only exception would be to party with an additional 30 player. Only one player at thirty+ brings the entire party into the thirty+ queue. They are going to join a new queue of players now having their MMR effectively reset when they hit level 30. The new players will be entering a new queue.</p><p>BUG FIXES</p><p>Fixed a problem where if you lock in the god who owns your voice, whichever icon you pick the most breaks your tabs and the other tabs don’t.</p><p>Fixed a problem where several jungle camps could lose their weight by bodyblocking them with pets.</p><p>Cliodhna Fixed an issue that had her ability 2 self buff last longer than she intended to death a god decoy. Raijin Fixed an issue where his combat anim was playing in a runny direction, but had to put his side on hand with his fight anim.</p><p>The Nemean Lion: Hide of the Nemean Lion. Fixed a problem where this item didn’t stack any as intended.</p><p>BALANCE LIVE WITH the TITAN OF THE COSMOS UPDATE.</p><p>SWC Conquest This Winter Conquest map will help you prepare for the Smite World Championships. The Pyromancer can see the Thors Hammer Trophy. SWC logo is engraved on the stutter at Mid Lane. Maps show statues honouring world champion god skins.</p><p>It’s difficult for everybody to agree on the right type of balance. Whats happening at their pro levels, that is about the ranking factor and the casual factor. Our own research shows that Mages have seen a large chunk of their overall damage in the adolescence of class. The boots have improved dramatically, especially with a mix of tanky and bruising play styles. Since then we’ve adjusted all the class but mages. We saw Warrior starter items get power early and then became Core Assassin items. In this update we are adding a little power to some mage items that focus on Penetration and other issues that are supporting them. This should make us more popular on Worlds than traditional DPS.
ENCHANTED SPEAR</p><p>Magical Power will be expanded from 40 to 60.</p><p>PERSONAL DESOLATIONS DEVENDANTS – PERSONAL SELFS.</p><p>Power Magical Increased from 110 to 120.</p><p>SPELL FOCUS</p><p>Expanded Magical Power from 45 to 55.</p><p>OBSIDIAN SHARD</p><p>Magical Power went from 80 to 90.</p><p>BOOK HOUNDS.</p><p>The magical power is increased from 55 to 65 m.</p><p>BOOK OF DEAD!</p><p>The sensibility of the passive between 30% and 25% of the maximum mana.</p><p>DAY OF THOSEING. There are a few starter items that are unpopular in the present meta, and this tree is one of them. We’re increasing the regen while in the jungle as well as upgrading the stats on the upgrade to stand out with the two other Jungler Starter items.</p><p>HP5 in jungle, from fifteen to 20, is increased from 15 to 20. In the jungle, it is 5 MP5, which is grown from 10 to 15 years old.</p><p>A PROTECTOR OF GNUEL-YELLOWERS</p><p>Increased Attack Speed from 25 to 35%.</p><p>TERRA When Terra’s ability to backfire Crushing Earth when Crushing Earth was cdored, she also refires by dashing it. That allowed him to re-fire and shatter the ability at the same time, effectively detonating it twice. In the short run, this feature walked the line between bug or emergent mechanic, but after seeing her performance in the live matches and SPL over multiple months we determined this effect is too strong, and Terra will have to choose between re-fire or shatter.
CRUSHING EARTH</p><p>That skill can only be re-fired or shattered, and not at the same time both at the same time.</p><p>BELLONA There’s a fair share of love in warriors who have been to the sword, but there’s no way Bellona could find the spot in the solo section. She is a big hit with her utilities, but she seems to struggle out of the gate in the street. We increase the base damage on Scourge to prevent that she can clear lanes with success, especially against gods who don’t budgeon.
SCOURGE</p><p>An additional 220 dollars dommage was incurred between 80 and 150.</p><p>GANESHA That peaceful god is ready to go back to the battleground. Ganesha has unique condition, which a means of CC is given in his channeled silence. To be sure that his peel lasts the intended duration of time, we provide him with knockback immunity. It should not be necessary to interrupt the reading by immediately noticing the results.
OHM</p><p>Ganesha is no longer immune to a knock-back condition while channeling this ability.</p><p>VAMANA In recent years we have not seen Vamana, and it is certainly not because of his height. This aggressive solo laner seemed to just need too much stuff to find a perfect build that works for her. He also takes good control of attack, and moves, but he doesn’t have to stay so fluid. We are changing his passive to help him find everything he needs to succeed.
SLEEPING GIANT</p><p>To convert the passive 10% of Vamanas Physical Protection to % Attack Speed. One of the best examples is the 100 Physical Protections that offer a 10 per cent speed at the attacks.</p><p>RATATOSKR The boots stayed, Ratatoskr couldn’t buy them (they simply couldn’t fit) but still deserves compensation for the loss. Acorns of a century were designed to give a fit to the footspace of a build, but now that builds don’t have a boots item in them, we would like the Acorns to more closely fit the stats of a three-tier item. There are some acorns seeing stat increases to help with that, with a little more stats going to the Acorns that are currently the least successful.
EVERGREEN ACORN</p><p>Increased strength of your hands from 25 to 35.</p><p>THICKBARK ACORN</p><p>Added strength 35 from 25-35 to 25.</p><p>BRISTLEBUSH ACORN</p><p>Expanded Physical Power to 35-45. He increased the bonus of batatoskr in order to protect against a god with Dart by three years of physical lifesteal and one-third of basic attacks to 15 %.</p><p>THISTLETHORN ACORN</p><p>Increased physical power from 45 to 50, according to science.</p><p>MERCURY The fastest god has gotten faster than his predecessor. When Mercury uses his Made Ya Look skills, he actually sprints to another location to a target and then reloads his shot. Well now he can do that by the wall, without any more abilities. Don’t ask us how, but Mercury should be a life-saving act of fighting for more targets in the jungle.
MANY YEARS ATTEND TO YA!</p><p>Now can be fired by walls?</p><p>NEITH Fate has not favored the goddess. He got a few promotions earlier this year that seemed promising and we saw a glimpse of Neith at the competitive level and then she slipped off. We have two buffs on her today to try to bring her back. Their passive weaves have been going to last two times longer, allowing Neiths to better lay out deployables for future advantages. We also give an extra damage boost to help her laning and 1v1.
BROKEN WEAVE</p><p>Longer Weave time, from 1m to 2m.</p><p>UNRAVEL</p><p>More damage to the ground up from 70/100/130/160/190 to 70/110/150/190/230.</p><p>JING WEI Oh, sigh! Now is the time to show some Judahi buffs. The evasive goddess was a squatter of overheating, which screamed her ability to return to the pro meta as a result of his ability to make the pro meta at any moment, especially when the stakes were high. There are other safe hunters in the contest that will compete with Jing Wei now, so it appears like the perfect time for a buff. Explosive Bolts are improving their effects when they aren’t online. We’re also having to reduce mana costs to improve his car’s lane phase.
EXPLOSIVE BOLTS</p><p>The damage per shot increased from 100% to 1200%. These include targets also hit by the explosion. Fixed the problem with her ability screen that displayed incorrect Basic Attack information when Explosive Bolts became active.</p><p>PERSISTENT GUST</p><p>Mana cost increased from 60/70/80 to 60/65/70/75/80.</p><p>AIR STRIKE</p><p>Decreased Mana Cost from 100-110/120/130/140 to 80-90/100/120/120/120/120/180/160/160/120/140/120/120/115/100/180/120/120/130/140/80/120/120/180/130/120/120/120/140/100/190/100/120/120/100/120/100/100/120/120/110/120/120/100/120/110/120/</p><p>MEDUSA Don’t be looking at her right away, but it’s finally the long-awaited community request for Medusa. This famous goddess has a fantastic kit that never reached the competitive height of the world. In this update, she is going to be a more effective anti-healing god, and that makes her journey faster – and thereby be able to damage minions!
ACID SPRAY</p><p>Now applies Healing Reduction equal to 50% for 4s.</p><p>LACERATE</p><p>They’re not using healing. Now slammed with coins as Medusa travels through them.</p><p>AN NON-SKIN VOICE ACTORS CANADA.</p><p>The book was published. Burning Desire Aphrodite:Misty Lee. Is there anything to do? Infinite Oracle Morgan Le Fay:Tifane Williams:Tifane Williams. Her husband: Shealey Van Sistine: Shealey Van Sistine:Natalie. Naga, noxious Mina:Vanessa Lemonides:. Iroh Bacchus:Cory Yee.
