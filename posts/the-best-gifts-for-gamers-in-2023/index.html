From PS4, PS5 and Nintendo Switch to Xbox Series X and Xbox One- you’ve come to the right place to find a range of must-have Christmas gifts, birthday presents and everything in between. If you’re in a pinch for time and want to see our best gifts for gamers, we’ve compiled all of our top picks for Switch, Xbox and PlayStation just below. Need more thorough gamer gift inspiration? Keep scrolling down to our full gift guide as we’ve probably found something that’s on your gamer’s wishlist.\nBest gifts for gamers Whether you’re treating yourself for no specific reason or looking for the perfect gifts for gamer friends and family, you can check out the best of what’s on offer below.\nBest Nintendo Switch gift ideas Best PlayStation gift ideas Best Xbox gift ideas Best VR headset gift ideas\nBest Nintendo Switch gift ideas There are three Nintendo Switch models to choose from: the original Nintendo Switch, the hand-held only Switch Lite, and the Nintendo Switch OLED, which is essentially the base console with an OLED screen and some other minor improvements. If you’re looking for a Switch, Switch Lite, or Switch OLED bundle that comes with a game or two, or you’re looking for a special edition console, you can find some great options from the following retailers:\nUK My Nintendo Store Currys Very Game\nUS Nintendo Store Best Buy GameStop\nYour recipient may, of course, already own a Nintendo Switch or is maybe receiving one from someone else, so we thought it would be a good idea to suggest some of this year’s best games, along with some must-have Nintendo Switch accessories.\nNintendo Switch consoles Nintendo Switch OLED The OLED is the prime choice of Nintendo Switch consoles if your recipient wants a premium gaming experience while playing in handheld mode, thanks to its larger, brighter screen, and enhanced audio. The improved docking station features an ethernet cable port, which is great when you need a stable internet connection while battling it out in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate or racing to the finish line in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Price-wise, you’re looking at spending around £310/ $350, but if you’re lucky, you might be able to snag one while on offer for under £300 in the UK.\nNintendo Switch The standard Nintendo Switch console positions itself in the mid-range price point and makes for a great gift for any age. This version can be played in handheld and displayed on the TV using the included docking station. You can find various colourways for this console, including Neon Red/ Neon Blue, Grey and some special edition consoles too. The Nintendo Switch usually costs around £259/ $299.\nNintendo Switch Lite The cheapest Switch console is the Nintendo Switch Lite. Although this console can only be played in handheld mode, its lighter weight and smaller design makes it great for portability or for those with smaller hands. Although the Switch Lite has a smaller LCD screen, it still offers the same 720p resolution as the standard Switch and has touch functionality. There’s a great range of colours to choose between, from a bright turquoise to a lovely Coral. Prices tend to start from around £199, but you may be able to find one cheaper from time to time.\nNintendo Switch games We’ve listed a selection of the top games you can play on Nintendo Switch below.\nPokemon Scarlet and Violet Scarlet and Violet are the latest games in the Pokemon series, serving up a whole new adventure for Pokemon fans on Nintendo Switch. Scarlet and Violet differ slightly, with some different Pokemon and some cut-scene changes, but other than that it’s still the same Pokemon gaming experience.\nPokemon Legends: Arceus This gem of a Pokemon game is a spin-off to the mainline series and received outstanding reviews earlier this year. Until the release of Scarlet and Violet, it has been one of the most popular Nintendo Switch games of 2022.\nKirby and the Forgotten Land Kirby’s all-new 3D action platformer transports you to a colourful world filled with cute characters, super fun levels and mini games. There’s also local play options, which means, you can play couch co-op with a friend or family member!\nSplatoon 3 Splatoon 3 is a super fun third person shooter that’s you can play on your own or with friends. It’s set in the world of Splatlands in the new city, Splatsville, where players must reload their splatguns and battle it out in colourful shoot-outs.\nNintendo Switch Sports Wii Sports was a staple back in 2006 thanks to its easy-to-play sports games, and now, you can play the beloved Tennis and Bowling modes all over again with Nintendo Switch Sports. The new and improved game also introduces four new sports: chambara, football, badminton, and volleyball. A golf mode has recently tee’d off too, thanks to the game’s latest update.\nMario Party Superstars Packed with lots of classic Mario Party boards and challenging mini-games, Mario Party Superstars is a whole bundle of fun for all ages and it’s the perfect party game to play. Choose from a huge cast of iconic Nintendo characters to play as and enjoy competing to get the most points as you play on a selection of courses.\nRing Fit Adventure Nintendo’s quirky fitness, action RPG isn’t just a highly sought after game because it’s an alternative way to exercise, but it’s also great fun to play alone or take turns with family and friends. The included Ring-Con and leg strap helps to combine real-world exercises with a fun RPG battle system, along with a bunch of mini-games.\nNintendo Switch accessories If you know someone who is receiving a Nintendo Switch, then there are some fantastic Switch accessories that make great affordable gifts, from a Nintendo Switch case to protect the console, to a micro SD card to store lots of digital games. They may also love an extra controller as an alternative to the Joy-Con pair, or even a controller charging station. Here are some of our top Nintendo Switch accessories that make great gifts.\nNintendo Switch/ Switch OLED case Micro SD card Standard Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite consoles come with 32GB internal storage, while the Switch OLED features 64GB of storage, all of which is probably enough to store a few digital games, but hardly enough once they begin to build their games collection. This is where a micro SD card comes in handy. There’s lots of micro SD cards on the market and we rate the Sandisk Extreme, Samsung Evo Select and Samsung Evo Plus. There are also the officially licensed memory cards for Nintendo Switch, which are great but tend to be a little on the pricier side. A 128GB or a 256GB size variant is good for starting out, but if you know your recipient is going to fill that up fast, a 512GB micro SD card will ensure plenty of space.\nSwitch controller The Nintendo Switch includes a Joy-Con pair, which you can use in handheld mode or you slot into the controller grip while playing in tabletop or TV mode. These are fine for the most part if you’re only playing for short gaming sessions, but if your recipient likes to play for long periods of time, a Switch controller offers a better and more comfortable experience. The official Switch Pro controller is one of the best wireless controllers for the console, but if you’re looking for a more affordable option, there are some cheaper wired and wireless options from officially licensed, third party brands such as Power A and Hori. Some of the main differences between the Switch Pro controller and third party brands is that they may not offer rumble or amiibo functionality.\nNintendo Switch eShop cards There are so many fun games to play on Nintendo Switch that it can be hard to know what to buy someone if they already have a huge game collection. If you’re struggling to decide what Nintendo Switch game to buy, you could always gift someone Nintendo eShop credit, so they can use it towards something they’ll love. Our pals at VG247 offer digital Nintendo eShop gift cards, ranging from as small as £15/$10 right up to £100/ $100.\rThe Nintendo eShop runs sales all throughout the year, which means your recipient can stretch their gift card value even further. If you purchase from the VG247 eShop, you’ll receive a digital code directly to your inbox, which the recipient will simply need to activate on their Nintendo account.\nNintendo eShop credit in the UK Nintendo eShop credit in the US Nintendo Switch merchandise If your recipient is partial to a Nintendo collectible or two, then they will probably love to receive one or some official Nintendo merch from My Nintendo Store. There’s everything from plush toys, figurines, and amiibos (which can be used in select games to unlock extra content) to apparel and much more. There’s something for almost every classic Nintendo characters from The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario and Kirby to Metroid and more.\nBest PlayStation gift ideas First things first: if you’re trying to get your hands on a new PS5 any time soon, we’d recommend heading on over to our PS5 stock updates page and following Jelly Deals on Twitter, as it’s the first place we’ll share news on any stock updates. In the meantime, you can make the most of these great deals on PS5 and PS4 games, accessories and discounts on PlayStation Plus subscriptions. Still can’t find what you’re looking for? Check out our guide to this month’s best PS5 deals and best PS4 deals for even more gift inspiration.\nPS5 consoles If your recipient has been patiently waiting to get their hands on a PlayStation 5 console since its release back in 2020, you’ll be pleased to know that you have a much higher chance of buying a PS5. Standalone consoles are a little harder to find, but there are many PS5 bundles up for grabs, including consoles with God of War Ragnarok, Fifa 23, Horizon Forbidden West, or Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.\nPS5 Disc console The standard PS5 disc console RRPs for slightly less at £479.99/$499.99. This version is able to play physical and digital copies of games. The PS5 console comes with a wireless PS5 DualSense controller. A copy of Astro’s Playroom is also included for free!\nPS5 Digital console The PS5 Digitial console costs £389.99/$399.99. This is the version without a disc drive, which means you’ll have to buy all of your games digitally. It comes with a DualSense wireless controller and all the neccessary cables to hook it up to your TV. The PS5 Digital Edition also comes with a free copy of Astro’s Playroom.\nPS5 accessories From an extra controller and charging station to a headset and extra storage, PS5 accessories are a great way to elevate someone’s gaming set up. We’ve listed a few of our favourites below.\nPS5 DualSense controller An extra PS5 controller is always handy to have on hand, whether you need to use it whilst your primary one charges, or for games that can be played in local co-op. We know we bang on about its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, but you really will struggle to find a decent third-party controller that meets its standards. It’s now available in white, black, red, blue, pink and purple colour variants.\nBuy now from Very in the UK, and from GameStop in the US\nDualSense Edge Wireless Controller If you’re buying for a serious gamer who gets a lot of use out of their console, you may want to consider treating them to the upcoming DualSense Edge Wireless controller, which is set to be released on 26th January. It bears a premium price tag of £209.99/ $199.99 and features everything that’s great about the standard controller, plus the added benefits of ultra custimisable controls, mappable back buttons and replaceable stick modules.\nPre-order now on PS Direct UK, and PS Direct US\nPS5 Pulse 3D Headset The official PS5 gaming headset offers a premium audio experience. It is available in white, black and camo colour variants. Its refined earpads and headband strap let you enjoy comfortable gaming sessions for long periods of time. The Pulse 3D headset also features a hidden noise-cancelling microphone, so you can chat to your friends while playing online. It has a battery life of up to 12 hours, too, which is more than enough for a CoD or Fifa night with mates.\nBuy now from The Game Collection in the UK, and from GameStop in the US\nLogitech G Pro X Lightspeed Digital Foundry’s recommended gaming headset for the PS5 can be used cross-platform on PS5, PS4 and PC, making it an ideal gift if they like to switch between console and PC. Will Judd noted this wireless gaming headset offers great usability thanks to its large number of controls on a single ear cup, and great comfort thanks to its ear pads and build quality. The headset’s 50mm drivers provide a neutral sound and consisten results. The battery life is decent - around 20 hours.\nPS5 controller charging station There’s no need to charge your PS5 controller via a cable when there’s a neat charging station to pop it on. It’s super handy to stick the controller on charge when you’re not playing and it can charge two controllers at once! This official charging station retails for £24.99/$24.99, but if you want to save some extra cash, there’s some decent third party options from brands like Oivo and Nexigo for around the £15/$20 mark.\nPS5 HD webcam If your recipient wants to record or broadcast themselves and their gameplay, Sony’s HD webcam for PlayStation 5 lets you so, with the touch of your DualSense wireless controller’s create button1. It offers smooth, sharp full-HD thanks to the camera’s dual wide-angle lenses and has a handy built-in stand so that your camera stays securely positioned.\nBuy from Base in the UK, and from GameStop in the US\nPS5 compatible SSD If you’re buying for a PS5 player who needs extra storage for their console, you could always buy them a PS5-compatible Solid State Drive. Upgrading the PS5 with an internal NVMe SSD with heatsink will expand the amount of storage inside the console, meaning PS5 players won’t need to keep deleting game files to make room for others. You can find more info on the best SSDs for the PS5 console in Digital Foundry’s detailed guide, but if you’re in a rush, their top 3 recommendations are:\nCrucial P5 Plus from £93/ $95 (you’ll need to buy a heatsink separately like this one by Sabrent for £20/$20) Adata XPG S70 Blade with included heatsink from £94/$110 Samsung 980 Pro Heatsink from £139/$112\nPlayStation Plus and PS Store gift cards Technically, PS Plus is being sold exclusively on the PlayStation Store. You can, however, purchase one of these PS gift cards to use towards your chosen PlayStation Plus subscription. Most PS Store gift cards will be digital, which means you’ll receive a digital download code.\nPS5 and PS4 games God of War: Ragnarok God of War Ragnarok is a Sony exclusive title for PS4 and PS5. It’s also the epic sequel to the hugely popular God of War game, which originally released on PS3, and later re-released on PS4. It continues the tale of Kratos and his boy, Artreus, as they journey across stunning landscapes and battle a variety of bosses and enemies.\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Not to be mistaken by the game of the same name that was released back in 2009, this completely new campaign is the sequel to 2019’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. This FPS will fire their way through action-packed infiltrations and missions with cutting-edge weapons, vehicles and equipment. You can also team up with your friends and take down the opposing side online. From epic gameplay and immersive audio, to a rebuilt, advanced AI system and more, this is a Call of Duty title that gamers won’t want to miss.\nHorizon Forbidden West Horizon Forbidden West is another Sony exclusive title. The sequel to Horizon: Zero Dawn, it transports you to an expansive open world, set in far-future America.

From stylish apparel, Lego and board games to Funko Pops inspired by PlayStation characters, there’s an endless stream of collectibles and merch to gift PlayStation fans.\nInsert Coin clothing Sure, you could easily nip to Primark for some cheap PlayStation-themed clothing, but if you’re looking for great quality and unique designs, you should check out these incredible collections from Insert Coin Clothing. They have apparel for Horizon, Ratchet and Clank, Sackboy and many more. They also sell a wide range of pins, mugs, beanies, socks (everybody loves a pair of good ol’ pair of socks) and other wares, too.\nShop the lot at Insert Coin Clothing\nLego Horizon Forbidden West Tallneck set Horizon fans will love this Lego set featuring a Tallneck figure. This is the most iconic Horizon machine in the Forbidden West and the set even comes with Aloy and a Watcher Lego figures.\nRatchet and Clank: Rift Apart Soundtrack on Vinyl Maybe a bit niche, but, if you know someone who loves the Ratchet and Clank series, loved the OST AND happens to a record player, this Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart Soundtrack on Vinyl- composed by Mark Mothersbaugh \u0026 Wataru Hokoyama- is a lovely piece of memoribillia to add to their vinyl collection.\nBest Xbox gift ideas Good news if you’re buying gifts for an Xbox fan - Xbox consoles are in stock and if you’re lucky you might be able to snag the odd discount on a Series X or Series S. Below you can find all of our top gift ideas for Xbox players. There are also some good value Xbox Series X/S bundles available right now, which can actually be better value than buying the console on its own. Check out our list below.\nXbox Series X console Xbox Series X bundle There are a number of Xbox Series X bundles at Game, including this Xbox Series X console with a copy of Saints Row Customs Edition (normally £25) for the console’s RRP price of £449.99. The game comes with what seems to be a Saints Row-themed neck scarf, and some extra digital content.\nBuy now from Game\nXbox Series S console Xbox Series S Gilded Hunter bundle This is one of the best Xbox Series S bundles available at the time of writing. The RRP of the Xbox Series S is £249, so this bundle essentially gets you a load of Fortnite, Rocket League and Fall Guys goodies for free.\nXbox Game Pass It’s worth keeping in mind that many of the best Xbox and Bethesda games are on/ coming to Xbox Game Pass, such as Halo Infinite, Flight Simulator, and the upcoming Starfield (2023). You may ask, what is Game Pass? Well, it’s an online membership that allows players to access hundreds of titles in the Xbox library, and gain access to new games each month. So, if you’re planning on buying a copy of Halo Infinite, you might want to consider gifting a Game Pass membership instead, since Master Chief’s latest campaign can be played via Game Pass. The Game Pass subscription is also a gift that will keep on giving, because the recipient can play more than that intended game. Plus, you needn’t worry if the recipient already has Game Pass, because they can simply stack the membership on top of their existing one. Our pals at VG247 offer a range of Game Pass memberships, including Game Pass Ultimate, which lets you play on both Xbox and PC, Game Pass for console only, which allows access on the Xbox, or Xbox Game Pass for PC, which, you guessed it, allows players to access the Game Pass library via their desktop.\nBuy a Game Pass membership from VG247 in the UK Buy a Game Pass membership from VG247 in the US\nHowever, if you know they haven’t been a member before, you could alternatively sign them up for only a £1/$1 for a one-month trial of Game Pass Ultimate. It could make for a nice extra stocking filler. Just make sure to cancel it after the month is out, or it’ll cost £10.99/ $14.99 per month after the trial has finished.\nXbox games Although there are many excellent games available to play on Game Pass, there are still plenty that you will want to purchase separately, which is why we’ve selected games below that you can’t find on Game Pass at the time of writing. If you would still prefer to buy physical games for an Xbox One or Xbox Series X player, our suggestions below can help you find the best Xbox game to gift.\nElden Ring This is, without a doubt, one of the best games of the year packed with lore, challenging battles and breathtaking landscapes. Elden Ring is not to be missed. It’s also available on PS5, PS4 and PC\nTiny Tina’s Wonderlands This game is a chaotically fun spin-off from the Borderlands series. Those on Xbox One will need to pick up the standard edition, while Xbox Series X players will benefit with the next-gen version aka the Next Level edition. It’s also available on PS5, PS4 and PC.\nBuy now for Xbox Series X from ShopTo in the UK, and from Best Buy in the US\nEvil West Red Dead fans looking for a new adventure in the ollllld West will absolutely love this old-school, third person shooter with a blood-thirsty, vampire-hunting twist.

It ain’t cheap, but it sure is a treat to play with. Some of the highlights that set this controller apart from the standard Xbox Series controller include adjustable-tension thumbsticks, interchangeable components and an enhanced build quality.\nBuy now from Microsoft Store UK and Microsoft Store US\nOfficial Xbox wireless gaming headset Digital Foundry didn’t need to wander too far from the tree to find the best gaming headset for the Xbox Series X/S. Will Judd noted that Microsoft’s official Xbox wireless gaming headset is light and comfortable, has good battery life and provides great sound. Will also described these as the best value wireless headset for the Xbox. We’re sure that any Xbox player would love to receive these headphones as a gift.\nSeagate Expansion Card This is the only official internal storage for the Xbox Series X/S, which means if you need more room for your games and run them seamlessly, you’ll want to grab one of these. This SSD has a 1TB capacity, but there is normally a 512GB and a 2TB version too, but the smaller and larger size variants are currently out of stock in the UK.\nXbox merchandise Gamers who like to collect all things Xbox will probably appreicate the odd collectible, apparel and so on. Here a few things we think would make fun gifts for Xbox players.\nOfficial Xbox Achievement Light Receiving this light as a gift will unlock an achievement in itself. It’s perfect for those who love to go after Xbox achievements in games, and makes a great accessory on either a gaming desk or shelf.\nHalo Master Chief Infinite Exclusive Cable Guy These Cable Guy figurines don’t often dip below the £25 mark, but we spotted this Master Chief one from Lost Universe for only £20. It not only holds your Xbox controller, it can also be used as a stand for your smartphone. This is a perfect gift for Halo fans and ideal to place next to your console, PC or on a shelf.\nBest VR headset gift ideas With major franchises debuting VR spin-offs now, whether it’s Half-Life: Alyx or Resident Evil 4: VR, there are plenty of reasons to pick up a VR headset. The immersive feel means gameplay packs way more punch than staring at a TV or monitor with a controller in your hand.

We recommend checking out Digital Foundry’s guide to the best VR headsets in 2022 for more in-depth info and comparisons.\nMeta Quest 2 The 128GB Meta Quest 2 VR headset RRPs for £399.99/$399.99 and includes the VR headset and two controllers, plus the super-fun rhythm game, Beat Saber for free. It also comes in a 256GB size variant. Digital Foundry rated the Meta Quest 2 as the best value option. Since you do not need a PC to use it, this is a great entry level VR headset.\nHTC Vive Pro 2 Digital Foundry are a fan of this headset’s high res LCD HMD, thanks to its resolution of 4896x2448, and a great refresh rate of 120Hz. Will Judd noted that although it’s controllers aren’t as advanced as the Valve Index in terms of tracking accuracy, it remains a strong option for most people. As an added bonus, you’ll receive two free months of unlimited VR with Viveport Infinity when you purchase from the Vive Store. It’s also worth noting that you or your recipient will need a PC that meets the HTC Vive Pro 2’s specifications to be able to power the device.\nBuy now from Vive UK and Vive US\nCongrats on making it to the end of our gift guide!

something for everyone in our guide packed full of gifts for gamers. From PS4, PS5 and Nintendo Switch to Xbox Series X and Xbox One- you&rsquo;ve come to the right place to find a range of must-have Christmas gifts, birthday presents and everything in between.
If you&rsquo;re in a pinch for time and want to see our best gifts for gamers, we&rsquo;ve compiled all of our top picks for Switch, Xbox and PlayStation just below. Need more thorough gamer gift inspiration? Keep scrolling down to our full gift guide as we&rsquo;ve probably found something that&rsquo;s on your gamer&rsquo;s wishlist.</p><h2 id=best-gifts-for-gamers>Best gifts for gamers<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-gifts-for-gamers>#</a></h2><p>Whether you&rsquo;re treating yourself for no specific reason or looking for the perfect gifts for gamer friends and family, you can check out the best of what&rsquo;s on offer below.</p><p>Best Nintendo Switch gift ideas Best PlayStation gift ideas Best Xbox gift ideas Best VR headset gift ideas</p><h2 id=best-nintendo-switch-gift-ideas>Best Nintendo Switch gift ideas<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-nintendo-switch-gift-ideas>#</a></h2><p>There are three Nintendo Switch models to choose from: the original Nintendo Switch, the hand-held only Switch Lite, and the Nintendo Switch OLED, which is essentially the base console with an OLED screen and some other minor improvements.
If you&rsquo;re looking for a Switch, Switch Lite, or Switch OLED bundle that comes with a game or two, or you&rsquo;re looking for a special edition console, you can find some great options from the following retailers:</p><h3 id=uk>UK<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#uk>#</a></h3><p>My Nintendo Store Currys Very Game</p><h3 id=us>US<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#us>#</a></h3><p>Nintendo Store Best Buy GameStop</p><p>Your recipient may, of course, already own a Nintendo Switch or is maybe receiving one from someone else, so we thought it would be a good idea to suggest some of this year&rsquo;s best games, along with some must-have Nintendo Switch accessories.</p><h2 id=nintendo-switch-consoles>Nintendo Switch consoles<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#nintendo-switch-consoles>#</a></h2><h3 id=nintendo-switch-oled>Nintendo Switch OLED<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#nintendo-switch-oled>#</a></h3><p>The OLED is the prime choice of Nintendo Switch consoles if your recipient wants a premium gaming experience while playing in handheld mode, thanks to its larger, brighter screen, and enhanced audio. The improved docking station features an ethernet cable port, which is great when you need a stable internet connection while battling it out in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate or racing to the finish line in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
Price-wise, you&rsquo;re looking at spending around £310/ $350, but if you&rsquo;re lucky, you might be able to snag one while on offer for under £300 in the UK.</p><h3 id=nintendo-switch>Nintendo Switch<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#nintendo-switch>#</a></h3><p>The standard Nintendo Switch console positions itself in the mid-range price point and makes for a great gift for any age. This version can be played in handheld and displayed on the TV using the included docking station. You can find various colourways for this console, including Neon Red/ Neon Blue, Grey and some special edition consoles too. The Nintendo Switch usually costs around £259/ $299.</p><h3 id=nintendo-switch-lite>Nintendo Switch Lite<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#nintendo-switch-lite>#</a></h3><p>The cheapest Switch console is the Nintendo Switch Lite. Although this console can only be played in handheld mode, its lighter weight and smaller design makes it great for portability or for those with smaller hands. Although the Switch Lite has a smaller LCD screen, it still offers the same 720p resolution as the standard Switch and has touch functionality.
There&rsquo;s a great range of colours to choose between, from a bright turquoise to a lovely Coral. Prices tend to start from around £199, but you may be able to find one cheaper from time to time.</p><h2 id=nintendo-switch-games>Nintendo Switch games<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#nintendo-switch-games>#</a></h2><p>We&rsquo;ve listed a selection of the top games you can play on Nintendo Switch below.</p><h3 id=pokemon-scarlet-and-violet>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pokemon-scarlet-and-violet>#</a></h3><p>Scarlet and Violet are the latest games in the Pokemon series, serving up a whole new adventure for Pokemon fans on Nintendo Switch. Scarlet and Violet differ slightly, with some different Pokemon and some cut-scene changes, but other than that it&rsquo;s still the same Pokemon gaming experience.</p><h3 id=pokemon-legends-arceus>Pokemon Legends: Arceus<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pokemon-legends-arceus>#</a></h3><p>This gem of a Pokemon game is a spin-off to the mainline series and received outstanding reviews earlier this year. Until the release of Scarlet and Violet, it has been one of the most popular Nintendo Switch games of 2022.</p><h3 id=kirby-and-the-forgotten-land>Kirby and the Forgotten Land<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#kirby-and-the-forgotten-land>#</a></h3><p>Kirby&rsquo;s all-new 3D action platformer transports you to a colourful world filled with cute characters, super fun levels and mini games. There&rsquo;s also local play options, which means, you can play couch co-op with a friend or family member!</p><h3 id=splatoon-3>Splatoon 3<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#splatoon-3>#</a></h3><p>Splatoon 3 is a super fun third person shooter that&rsquo;s you can play on your own or with friends. It&rsquo;s set in the world of Splatlands in the new city, Splatsville, where players must reload their splatguns and battle it out in colourful shoot-outs.</p><h3 id=nintendo-switch-sports>Nintendo Switch Sports<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#nintendo-switch-sports>#</a></h3><p>Wii Sports was a staple back in 2006 thanks to its easy-to-play sports games, and now, you can play the beloved Tennis and Bowling modes all over again with Nintendo Switch Sports. The new and improved game also introduces four new sports: chambara, football, badminton, and volleyball. A golf mode has recently tee&rsquo;d off too, thanks to the game&rsquo;s latest update.</p><h3 id=mario-party-superstars>Mario Party Superstars<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#mario-party-superstars>#</a></h3><p>Packed with lots of classic Mario Party boards and challenging mini-games, Mario Party Superstars is a whole bundle of fun for all ages and it&rsquo;s the perfect party game to play. Choose from a huge cast of iconic Nintendo characters to play as and enjoy competing to get the most points as you play on a selection of courses.</p><h3 id=ring-fit-adventure>Ring Fit Adventure<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ring-fit-adventure>#</a></h3><p>Nintendo&rsquo;s quirky fitness, action RPG isn&rsquo;t just a highly sought after game because it&rsquo;s an alternative way to exercise, but it&rsquo;s also great fun to play alone or take turns with family and friends. The included Ring-Con and leg strap helps to combine real-world exercises with a fun RPG battle system, along with a bunch of mini-games.</p><h2 id=nintendo-switch-accessories>Nintendo Switch accessories<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#nintendo-switch-accessories>#</a></h2><p>If you know someone who is receiving a Nintendo Switch, then there are some fantastic Switch accessories that make great affordable gifts, from a Nintendo Switch case to protect the console, to a micro SD card to store lots of digital games. They may also love an extra controller as an alternative to the Joy-Con pair, or even a controller charging station.
Here are some of our top Nintendo Switch accessories that make great gifts.</p><h3 id=nintendo-switch-switch-oled-case>Nintendo Switch/ Switch OLED case<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#nintendo-switch-switch-oled-case>#</a></h3><h3 id=micro-sd-card>Micro SD card<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#micro-sd-card>#</a></h3><p>Standard Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite consoles come with 32GB internal storage, while the Switch OLED features 64GB of storage, all of which is probably enough to store a few digital games, but hardly enough once they begin to build their games collection. This is where a micro SD card comes in handy. There&rsquo;s lots of micro SD cards on the market and we rate the Sandisk Extreme, Samsung Evo Select and Samsung Evo Plus. There are also the officially licensed memory cards for Nintendo Switch, which are great but tend to be a little on the pricier side.
A 128GB or a 256GB size variant is good for starting out, but if you know your recipient is going to fill that up fast, a 512GB micro SD card will ensure plenty of space.</p><h3 id=switch-controller>Switch controller<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#switch-controller>#</a></h3><p>The Nintendo Switch includes a Joy-Con pair, which you can use in handheld mode or you slot into the controller grip while playing in tabletop or TV mode. These are fine for the most part if you&rsquo;re only playing for short gaming sessions, but if your recipient likes to play for long periods of time, a Switch controller offers a better and more comfortable experience.
The official Switch Pro controller is one of the best wireless controllers for the console, but if you&rsquo;re looking for a more affordable option, there are some cheaper wired and wireless options from officially licensed, third party brands such as Power A and Hori. Some of the main differences between the Switch Pro controller and third party brands is that they may not offer rumble or amiibo functionality.</p><h2 id=nintendo-switch-eshop-cards>Nintendo Switch eShop cards<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#nintendo-switch-eshop-cards>#</a></h2><p>There are so many fun games to play on Nintendo Switch that it can be hard to know what to buy someone if they already have a huge game collection. If you&rsquo;re struggling to decide what Nintendo Switch game to buy, you could always gift someone Nintendo eShop credit, so they can use it towards something they&rsquo;ll love. Our pals at VG247 offer digital Nintendo eShop gift cards, ranging from as small as £15/$10 right up to £100/ $100.
The Nintendo eShop runs sales all throughout the year, which means your recipient can stretch their gift card value even further. If you purchase from the VG247 eShop, you&rsquo;ll receive a digital code directly to your inbox, which the recipient will simply need to activate on their Nintendo account.</p><h2 id=nintendo-eshop-credit-in-the-uk>Nintendo eShop credit in the UK<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#nintendo-eshop-credit-in-the-uk>#</a></h2><h3 id=nintendo-eshop-credit-in-the-us>Nintendo eShop credit in the US<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#nintendo-eshop-credit-in-the-us>#</a></h3><h2 id=nintendo-switch-merchandise>Nintendo Switch merchandise<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#nintendo-switch-merchandise>#</a></h2><p>If your recipient is partial to a Nintendo collectible or two, then they will probably love to receive one or some official Nintendo merch from My Nintendo Store. There&rsquo;s everything from plush toys, figurines, and amiibos (which can be used in select games to unlock extra content) to apparel and much more. There&rsquo;s something for almost every classic Nintendo characters from The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario and Kirby to Metroid and more.</p><h2 id=best-playstation-gift-ideas>Best PlayStation gift ideas<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-playstation-gift-ideas>#</a></h2><p>First things first: if you&rsquo;re trying to get your hands on a new PS5 any time soon, we&rsquo;d recommend heading on over to our PS5 stock updates page and following Jelly Deals on Twitter, as it&rsquo;s the first place we&rsquo;ll share news on any stock updates.

Check out our guide to this month&rsquo;s best PS5 deals and best PS4 deals for even more gift inspiration.</p><h2 id=ps5-consoles>PS5 consoles<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ps5-consoles>#</a></h2><p>If your recipient has been patiently waiting to get their hands on a PlayStation 5 console since its release back in 2020, you&rsquo;ll be pleased to know that you have a much higher chance of buying a PS5. Standalone consoles are a little harder to find, but there are many PS5 bundles up for grabs, including consoles with God of War Ragnarok, Fifa 23, Horizon Forbidden West, or Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.</p><h3 id=ps5-disc-console>PS5 Disc console<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ps5-disc-console>#</a></h3><p>The standard PS5 disc console RRPs for slightly less at £479.99/$499.99. This version is able to play physical and digital copies of games. The PS5 console comes with a wireless PS5 DualSense controller. A copy of Astro&rsquo;s Playroom is also included for free!</p><h3 id=ps5-digital-console>PS5 Digital console<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ps5-digital-console>#</a></h3><p>The PS5 Digitial console costs £389.99/$399.99. This is the version without a disc drive, which means you&rsquo;ll have to buy all of your games digitally. It comes with a DualSense wireless controller and all the neccessary cables to hook it up to your TV. The PS5 Digital Edition also comes with a free copy of Astro&rsquo;s Playroom.</p><h2 id=ps5-accessories>PS5 accessories<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ps5-accessories>#</a></h2><p>From an extra controller and charging station to a headset and extra storage, PS5 accessories are a great way to elevate someone&rsquo;s gaming set up. We&rsquo;ve listed a few of our favourites below.</p><h3 id=ps5-dualsense-controller>PS5 DualSense controller<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ps5-dualsense-controller>#</a></h3><p>An extra PS5 controller is always handy to have on hand, whether you need to use it whilst your primary one charges, or for games that can be played in local co-op. We know we bang on about its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, but you really will struggle to find a decent third-party controller that meets its standards. It&rsquo;s now available in white, black, red, blue, pink and purple colour variants.</p><p>Buy now from Very in the UK, and from GameStop in the US</p><h3 id=dualsense-edge-wireless-controller>DualSense Edge Wireless Controller<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dualsense-edge-wireless-controller>#</a></h3><p>If you&rsquo;re buying for a serious gamer who gets a lot of use out of their console, you may want to consider treating them to the upcoming DualSense Edge Wireless controller, which is set to be released on 26th January. It bears a premium price tag of £209.99/ $199.99 and features everything that&rsquo;s great about the standard controller, plus the added benefits of ultra custimisable controls, mappable back buttons and replaceable stick modules.</p><p>Pre-order now on PS Direct UK, and PS Direct US</p><h3 id=ps5-pulse-3d-headset>PS5 Pulse 3D Headset<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ps5-pulse-3d-headset>#</a></h3><p>The official PS5 gaming headset offers a premium audio experience. It is available in white, black and camo colour variants. Its refined earpads and headband strap let you enjoy comfortable gaming sessions for long periods of time. The Pulse 3D headset also features a hidden noise-cancelling microphone, so you can chat to your friends while playing online. It has a battery life of up to 12 hours, too, which is more than enough for a CoD or Fifa night with mates.</p><p>Buy now from The Game Collection in the UK, and from GameStop in the US</p><h3 id=logitech-g-pro-x-lightspeed>Logitech G Pro X Lightspeed<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#logitech-g-pro-x-lightspeed>#</a></h3><p>Digital Foundry&rsquo;s recommended gaming headset for the PS5 can be used cross-platform on PS5, PS4 and PC, making it an ideal gift if they like to switch between console and PC. Will Judd noted this wireless gaming headset offers great usability thanks to its large number of controls on a single ear cup, and great comfort thanks to its ear pads and build quality. The headset&rsquo;s 50mm drivers provide a neutral sound and consisten results. The battery life is decent - around 20 hours.</p><h3 id=ps5-controller-charging-station>PS5 controller charging station<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ps5-controller-charging-station>#</a></h3><p>There&rsquo;s no need to charge your PS5 controller via a cable when there&rsquo;s a neat charging station to pop it on. It&rsquo;s super handy to stick the controller on charge when you&rsquo;re not playing and it can charge two controllers at once! This official charging station retails for £24.99/$24.99, but if you want to save some extra cash, there&rsquo;s some decent third party options from brands like Oivo and Nexigo for around the £15/$20 mark.</p><h3 id=ps5-hd-webcam>PS5 HD webcam<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ps5-hd-webcam>#</a></h3><p>If your recipient wants to record or broadcast themselves and their gameplay, Sony&rsquo;s HD webcam for PlayStation 5 lets you so, with the touch of your DualSense wireless controller’s create button1. It offers smooth, sharp full-HD thanks to the camera’s dual wide-angle lenses and has a handy built-in stand so that your camera stays securely positioned.</p><p>Buy from Base in the UK, and from GameStop in the US</p><h3 id=ps5-compatible-ssd>PS5 compatible SSD<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ps5-compatible-ssd>#</a></h3><p>If you&rsquo;re buying for a PS5 player who needs extra storage for their console, you could always buy them a PS5-compatible Solid State Drive. Upgrading the PS5 with an internal NVMe SSD with heatsink will expand the amount of storage inside the console, meaning PS5 players won&rsquo;t need to keep deleting game files to make room for others.
You can find more info on the best SSDs for the PS5 console in Digital Foundry&rsquo;s detailed guide, but if you&rsquo;re in a rush, their top 3 recommendations are:</p><p>Crucial P5 Plus from £93/ $95 (you&rsquo;ll need to buy a heatsink separately like this one by Sabrent for £20/$20) Adata XPG S70 Blade with included heatsink from £94/$110 Samsung 980 Pro Heatsink from £139/$112</p><h2 id=playstation-plus-and-ps-store-gift-cards>PlayStation Plus and PS Store gift cards<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#playstation-plus-and-ps-store-gift-cards>#</a></h2><p>Technically, PS Plus is being sold exclusively on the PlayStation Store. You can, however, purchase one of these PS gift cards to use towards your chosen PlayStation Plus subscription. Most PS Store gift cards will be digital, which means you&rsquo;ll receive a digital download code.</p><h2 id=ps5-and-ps4-games>PS5 and PS4 games<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ps5-and-ps4-games>#</a></h2><h3 id=god-of-war-ragnarok>God of War: Ragnarok<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#god-of-war-ragnarok>#</a></h3><p>God of War Ragnarok is a Sony exclusive title for PS4 and PS5. It&rsquo;s also the epic sequel to the hugely popular God of War game, which originally released on PS3, and later re-released on PS4. It continues the tale of Kratos and his boy, Artreus, as they journey across stunning landscapes and battle a variety of bosses and enemies.</p><h3 id=call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2>#</a></h3><p>Not to be mistaken by the game of the same name that was released back in 2009, this completely new campaign is the sequel to 2019&rsquo;s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.

Below you can find all of our top gift ideas for Xbox players.
There are also some good value Xbox Series X/S bundles available right now, which can actually be better value than buying the console on its own. Check out our list below.</p><h3 id=xbox-series-x-console>Xbox Series X console<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#xbox-series-x-console>#</a></h3><h3 id=xbox-series-x-bundle>Xbox Series X bundle<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#xbox-series-x-bundle>#</a></h3><p>There are a number of Xbox Series X bundles at Game, including this Xbox Series X console with a copy of Saints Row Customs Edition (normally £25) for the console&rsquo;s RRP price of £449.99. The game comes with what seems to be a Saints Row-themed neck scarf, and some extra digital content.</p><p>Buy now from Game</p><h3 id=xbox-series-s-console>Xbox Series S console<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#xbox-series-s-console>#</a></h3><h3 id=xbox-series-s-gilded-hunter-bundle>Xbox Series S Gilded Hunter bundle<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#xbox-series-s-gilded-hunter-bundle>#</a></h3><p>This is one of the best Xbox Series S bundles available at the time of writing. The RRP of the Xbox Series S is £249, so this bundle essentially gets you a load of Fortnite, Rocket League and Fall Guys goodies for free.</p><h2 id=xbox-game-pass>Xbox Game Pass<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#xbox-game-pass>#</a></h2><p>It&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind that many of the best Xbox and Bethesda games are on/ coming to Xbox Game Pass, such as Halo Infinite, Flight Simulator, and the upcoming Starfield (2023). You may ask, what is Game Pass? Well, it&rsquo;s an online membership that allows players to access hundreds of titles in the Xbox library, and gain access to new games each month.
So, if you&rsquo;re planning on buying a copy of Halo Infinite, you might want to consider gifting a Game Pass membership instead, since Master Chief&rsquo;s latest campaign can be played via Game Pass. The Game Pass subscription is also a gift that will keep on giving, because the recipient can play more than that intended game. Plus, you needn&rsquo;t worry if the recipient already has Game Pass, because they can simply stack the membership on top of their existing one.
Our pals at VG247 offer a range of Game Pass memberships, including Game Pass Ultimate, which lets you play on both Xbox and PC, Game Pass for console only, which allows access on the Xbox, or Xbox Game Pass for PC, which, you guessed it, allows players to access the Game Pass library via their desktop.</p><p>Buy a Game Pass membership from VG247 in the UK Buy a Game Pass membership from VG247 in the US</p><p>However, if you know they haven&rsquo;t been a member before, you could alternatively sign them up for only a £1/$1 for a one-month trial of Game Pass Ultimate. It could make for a nice extra stocking filler. Just make sure to cancel it after the month is out, or it&rsquo;ll cost £10.99/ $14.99 per month after the trial has finished.</p><h2 id=xbox-games>Xbox games<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#xbox-games>#</a></h2><p>Although there are many excellent games available to play on Game Pass, there are still plenty that you will want to purchase separately, which is why we&rsquo;ve selected games below that you can&rsquo;t find on Game Pass at the time of writing.
If you would still prefer to buy physical games for an Xbox One or Xbox Series X player, our suggestions below can help you find the best Xbox game to gift.</p><h3 id=elden-ring>Elden Ring<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#elden-ring>#</a></h3><p>This is, without a doubt, one of the best games of the year packed with lore, challenging battles and breathtaking landscapes.
