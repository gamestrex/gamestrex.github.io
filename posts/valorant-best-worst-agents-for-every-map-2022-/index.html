No matter the skill level of the agent, the map determines who will win and who will perish.\nThe Best and Worst Agents For Ascent Map in Valorant Best: Jett, Sova, Killjoy, Astra, Omen, Phoenix and Skye Worst: Reyna\nYou may not see him on Split but Sova is perfect as an attacker and on defence in Ascent. His recon arrow will light up enemies like Christmas lights. No one can hide from him here. In the meantime, you can use Jett to smoke opponents out and kill them with Dash. Drop a turret with Killjoy as you hold down the fort and place Nanoswarms in places like the B site. You can even use Astra and Omen to smoke out opponents with Jett as you slow down retakes and pushes. If you want to have an explosive entrance, however, you can always use KAY-O, Skye and if you’re feeling it, Phoenix. Whatever floats your boat!\nThe Best and Worst Agents For Bind Map in Valorant Best: KAY-O, Jett, Omen, Astra, Sova, Viper and Phoenix Worst: Yoru\nThe most effective place for Viper’s walls has got to be Bind. Here, you can put up walls that can be split among A, B or mid down so that you create opportunities for your team to annihilate the opposition. You can even use Raze with ease in this map as you clear out spaces with nades and other fun explosive pack plays. Your team is bound to fail if they don’t have Sova, Omen or even Astra on this map. I mean, you really can’t win without at least two of them. And finally, to round out the team, you can use either KAY-O, Phoenix, Jett, Reyna, Skye or Cypher to fill in the last spot.\nThe Best and Worst Agents For Breeze Map Best: Viper, Sova, Sage, Omen and Astra Worst: Raze\nUse Viper’s toxic clouds and walls to shorten long-range duels as she provides some important post-plant utility. The large map is great for Sova to find and bring intel. This will bring out opening kills with ease. You can even use Sage to block entries A or B with her walls. This then gives Astra and Omen the freedom to smoke off long-distance angles on-site.\nThe Best and Worst Agents For Fracture Map Best: Sage, Jett, Cypher, Raze, Killjoy, Breech, Omen, Astra and Viper Worst: Sova\nFracture is a map that has Defenders spawn in the middle. The best agents for this map in Valorant are the ones that can use their walls to the fullest, just like in Bind. Use Killjoy to cover multiple entrances. With her turret, you can easily detect and injure your opponents before they have the chance to attack. Use Viper and her walls to spin the game in your favour as any opponent is no match for her on this map. Or set the map ablaze with Raze. Her killer kit really sets the tone for how the game will end up. Use Cypher to gather intel with ease here. With Omen or Astra smoking out your enemies, it will be easy to use Sage, Breach and KAY-O to shut Killjoy down as attackers. Jett, on the other hand, is a well-rounded agent that is able to lead both sides to victory.\nThe Best and Worst Agents For Haven Best: Raze, Killjoy, Sova, Phoenix, Omen, Astra and Viper Worst: Reyna\nWith a map as big yet constricted as Haven, one of the best agents for this Valorant map is Raze. She has the best chance to use her Boombot here as well as her grenades to close off other areas. This map is the best for Killjoy’s ultimate that can clear out any of the three sites with complete ease. Phoenix can use his flashes to wall off sections and with the number of hiding places available to Run It Back, he should be able to use this map to the fullest. Some other valuable members in your team will have to be Sova, Viper, Omen and Astra because of their formidable abilities on most maps. They aren’t S-Tier Agents for nothing, you know. These definitely are the best agents for most maps in Valorant. Period.\nThe Best and Worst Agents For Icebox Best: Viper, Sage, Jett, Sova, KAY-O and Phoenix Worst: Astra and Omen\nIf you want to win in Icebox, then you’re going to need to use walls. It’s as plain and simple as that. The best agents for this Valorant map have got to be Viper, Sage, KAY-O and Phoenix. As they work best on this map and for good reason. There are just so many placement spots where you can easily put up walls and catch enemies. This map allows for sites A and B to have recon arrows and drones from Sova easily. So why wouldn’t you use him to the fullest? Use Jett to distract your enemies and get those kills all the way to victory.\nThe Best and Worst Agents For Split Best: Jett, Sage, Skye, Astra, Omen, Viper, Killjoy Worst: Sova\nSplit is known for its elevated spots. So it should come as no surprise that Jett has the superior hand over here. With her ability to elevate and thrust forward, you’re bound to distract your enemies as your teammates kill the same opponents. Pair this move with Skye’s flashes and you’re on your way to keep the enemy at bay as you take over. You can also use Omen or Astra to fire off smokes as Sage uses her walls to box off enemy entry points. And to tie the knot on this perfect defense team, Viper or Killjoy can be used as post-plant defenses. This was your guide to the best agents for each map in Valorant.
