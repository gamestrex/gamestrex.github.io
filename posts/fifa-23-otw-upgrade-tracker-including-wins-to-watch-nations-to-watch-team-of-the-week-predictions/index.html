Meanwhile, Team of the Week is suspended while the 2022 World Cup takes place in Qatar, meaning that Team of the Week 10 will not be available until the conclusion of the tournament. Darwin Nunez was the last Ones to Watch player to receive a TOTW-based upgrade, bagging an in-form following his two-goal performance in Liverpool’s win against Southampton before the break. Corentin Tolisso (Lyon) and Tyler Adams (Leeds United) both have one more chance to earn a ‘Wins to Watch’ upgrade, but the mid-season World Cup break means their clubs will not be in action again until late December. These are dynamic cards that can receive upgrades for three reasons:\nTeam of the Week - OTW cards will always be upgraded if a player is included in Team of the Week. Cards will not receive performance-based boosts based on other promotions, so if Tyler Adams is featured in Team of the Year, for example (GO TYLER), then his OTW will not be affected. Man of the Match - As with TOTW, OTW cards can receive a performance-based upgrade if the player earns a Man of the Match card. These are released less frequently and often tie in with domestic cup competitions. Wins to Watch - Introduced last year, this mechanic means OTW cards can receive an extra +1 upgrade if their team secures three wins within eight domestic league matches of the card’s release. That is domestic league matches. Cups, European matches, etc, do not count. You’d be surprised how many people forget this. The player does not have to play in these matches to receive the upgrade. Nations to Watch - New for FIFA 23, players will also receive a +1 upgrade if their nation wins a match at the World Cup in Qatar. The player does not have to play in these matches (or even feature in the World Cup squad!) to be eligible.\nIn other words, it’s all about watching out for things that happen in real-life football. Or watching this tracker page, obviously. Trading dynamic cards, as this sort of thing is known, is a high-risk, high-reward method of turning your modest stack of FIFA coins into something more substantial. The idea is to buy them when they are least desirable and then sell them when they start to accumulate hype.\nHow it works - OTW cards usually go up in price in the run-up to a player’s latest match. To use a recent real-world example, Antony’s OTW card was lurking around the 200k mark on Friday October 7th, but rose to around 230k on Sunday October 9th when Man United beat Everton and the Brazilian winger scored in the first half. Anyone who bought in at the lower price could have sold for around 18.5k profit (after EA takes its 5% transaction tax). When to buy - If you want to buy an OTW card for trading, look for opportunities based on dips in the market and distance to the next game. If cards are dropping in price after the Weekend League, for example, and a player lost their last game, it might be a good time to buy. Buying later in the week as people are purchasing Weekend League teams, or in the immediate run-up to a match, is less of a good idea, because the player’s price will be inflated. Keep an eye on price-tracking sites like Futbin and Futwiz to spot these patterns. When to sell - The prime time to sell is right before the real-world match starts. Cards rise in the run-up to a match as people buy the card in the hope that its value will go up, and this makes the card more scarce and increases the price. Waiting until the match takes place can yield even better results, but there is no guarantee that the player will score. What you can guarantee, however, is that if the player is subbed or their team loses, the price will drop.\nOne thing we should also add is that some cards already have upgrades baked into their market value. For example, everyone knows that Man City is going to win three out of eight domestic league matches, and the price of Erling Haaland’s OTW reflects that. It will probably not go up at all when City clinch the third win. If someone is playing for a dominant club like Bayern Munich or Real Madrid, bear that in mind!\n","wordCount":"1068","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-23T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-23T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Charles Eldridge"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/fifa-23-otw-upgrade-tracker-including-wins-to-watch-nations-to-watch-team-of-the-week-predictions/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Fifa 23 Otw Upgrade Tracker Including Wins To Watch Nations To Watch Team Of The Week Predictions</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-23 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 23, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1068 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Charles Eldridge</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>But with three separate sources of potential upgrades for these cards—wins for the team, wins for the country, and of course Team of the Week cards for the individual—it can be tough to keep track of which card is about to get a performance boost and potentially go up in value.
