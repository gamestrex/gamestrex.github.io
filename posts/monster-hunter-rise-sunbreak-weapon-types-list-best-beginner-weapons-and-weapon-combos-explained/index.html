For more help on Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak, learn how to unlock Master Rank, use Switch Skill swap, and progress onward with our Monster Hunter Sunbreak walkthrough. Additionally, you’re able to pick and choose what weapon you want to use at any time. As weapons also require less materials to upgrade than in previous entries, it’s even easier to switch up to another weapon and playstyle if you’re looking for variety. Some weapons dish out huge amounts of damage and require charging and phial management, others are more familiar hack-and-slash types. Ranged weapons also exist, with different ammo types enabling you to dish out different amounts of elemental damage. Gyro aiming is also supported on Switch. The Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak weapons list is as follows: As for the best Monster Hunter Rise weapons, for beginners, we recommend the Sword and Shield, Dual Blades and Light Bowgun - and try each type in the training area before embarking on an early game hunt each. From there, everything from there apart from Charge Blade and Lance are ‘intermediate’, with those latter two as ‘advanced’ - don’t attempt to take these on until you know Monster Hunter better! Ultimately, whatever you choose, the village quests that constitute the solo campaign are also considerably easier than past games, so you shouldn’t have too much trouble even if you don’t upgrade your weapons very far and want to try something else.\nSunbreak Sword and Shield Switch Skills With the release of the Sunbreak expansion, there are two new Sword and Shield Switch/Silkbind Skills to learn: For one, weapons stats also have Affinity, which is usually related to the extra power given to elemental-based weapons. You’ll tend to notice that weapons with high raw damage has minus affinity, which acts as a balance since less powerful weapons can still prove powerful if a monster is weak to a specific elemental attack. Weapons are also grouped into sharp, blunt and piercing types. Sharp weapons like swords are best for cutting up fleshy unarmoured monsters and particularly great if you’re trying to cut off the monster’s tail. Blunt weapons like hammers are best for high-impact damage that can both stun monsters and break off armour plates. Meanwhile, piercing weapons like bows can get deep into monsters to inflict multiple damage. You’ll start out being able with the basic version of every weapon type, and with the new Training Area available in Kamura Village, it’s worth taking a trip there so you can get a feel for each weapon before you head out to a real hunt. The Training Area will list all your command inputs and there’s also a mechanical monster you can test your weapons on to see how much damage you deal in each area. Better still, you can also go into the menu and tweak its settings so that it turns around or attacks, great for practising parries. From your basic starting weapons, the weapon tree expands for every weapon type as you progress in the story and hunt more monsters. Be aware that some weapon trees may not unlock until you’ve fought the monster at High Rank. But provided you’ve progressed far enough in the story and have the materials, there’s nothing stopping you from forging and upgrading for say just the Long Sword but then deciding to forge a higher rarity Switch Axe, though you may still need to forge the base weapon first before you can upgrade it. Switch skills unlock as you progress in the story and essentially allow you to switch out some of your weapon skills, including Silkbind Attacks, that best fit your playstyle, though some are more subtle than others. The more you use one weapon type, the more switch skills you can potentially unlock, while later hunts also reward you with additional switch skills. A major game-changer in Monster Hunter Rise is the introduction of Wirebugs. These insects produce a special glowing silk thread hunters can use as a grapple, though you can just grapple thin air and wiredash, giving the game greater verticality than ever before, while expanding aerial combat previously limited to a select couple weapons. That may seem a little less significant now that mounting monsters has been replaced by wyvern-riding, but it still diversifies your combat options. Wirebugs also allow you to execute special Silkbind Attacks, which are unique to each weapon type. Most of these are actually based on the Hunter Arts introduced in Monster Hunter Generations but they’re easier to use, while their relatively quick cooldown makes them more viable to use regularly in a hunt compared to the previous Arts. To perform a Silkbind Attack, unsheathe your weapon and press either ZL and X or ZL and A. For ranged weapons, this will be mapped to R and X or R and A. Depending on the move, Silkbind Attacks cost either one or two wirebugs. Some weapon types will also have multiple Silkbind Attacks, which depend on the Switch Skills that are unlocked.\nTwin Blade Combo: A two-part attack that opens with a circular slash and follows up with a blade thrust. An easy attack to get multiple hits in with, so ideal for weapons with high elemental and status properties. Destroyer Oil: Uses a Wirebug to cover your blade with a special ointment whose effects trigger if ignited by friction with your shield. Increases Flinching damage.\nSunbreak Dual Blades new Switch Skills The following skills have been added for Dual Blades players as part of Monster Hunter Sunbreak:\nSide Slash Combo: This technique allows you to attack while evading, and if you work it into your combos, you can unleash a relentless attack that’s difficult to defend against. Spiral Slash: A Silkbind attack that launches you spiraling forwards. Once your attack connects, your body acts as a drill as your blades bore into your target’s flesh.\nSunbreak new Light Bowgun Switch Skills Here are the new Light Bowgun moves added for Sunbreak:\nCritical Firepower: A special shooting style that further raises damage output but narrows critical distance and increases recoil. Because the distance at which the power of ammo is most effective has been reduced, you will need to be aware and adjust your firing position. Wyvern Counter: An urgent retreat that fires a shot with massive recoil, using a Wirebug to stop. While not a powerful attack, its true value comes when it’s used to evade incoming attacks.\nSurge Slash Combo: An offensive style that combines speed with the weight of the weapon to unleash a stream of powerful slashes. Strongarm Stance: A technique that uses Ironsilk to reinforce both your arms and weapon temporarily to fend off attacks. If used while charging, you can quickly parry an attack and then unleash a fierce onslaught afterwards.\nSunbreak Long Sword Switch Skills Sacred Sheathe Combo: A slow methodical movement that can be executed following an attack.Upon sheathing your weapon, you can harness the increased spirit to unleash a follow-up slash. The power of the slash increases according to the level of the Spirit Gauge. If you are attacked before you have finished with the sheathe, it will consume one level of Spirit Gauge and the move will be cancelled. Harvest Moon: A move that casts out an Ironsilk ring that narrows your range of attack, but boosts spirit so you can go on the offensive. Within the ring, your Spirit Gauge won’t deplete, and if you perform any counter attacks, it will add additional hits.\nMonster Hunter Sunbreak Hammer Switch Skills Spinning Bludgeon (Charge): A technique that stores released power and funnels it into the next Charge Switch attack. Power is built up when performing a Spinning Bludgeon. The charge level is then maintained when executing a Charge Switch. Impact Burst: A Silkbind attack that wraps your weapon in Ironsilk. For a short period of time, any charged attack performed causes the silk to vibrate, creating a shockwave that makes it easier to flinch monsters.\nSunbreak Gunlance Switch Skills You’ll need to master these two new moves if you plan on using the Gunlance in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak:\nErupting Cannon: This technique involves firing an exploding stake into your target. When using the Eruption Cannon, the tip of the gunlance heats up and slashing attacks are enhanced for a certain period of time. Bullet Barrage: Uses a Wirebug to Blast Dash toward your target, unleashing everything with abandon.\nSunbreak Switch Axe new Switch Skills 2-Staged Morph Slash Combo: A two-staged Morph Slash attack that follows an Axe: Wild Swing. Elemental Burst Counter: Compresses Switch Gauge energy, that can be released as an Elemental Burst. If the burst is released right as a monster attacks, you’ll perform a Power Finisher and your switch axe will go into an Amped State.\nSunbreak Hunting Horn New Skills Swing Combo: A two-hit attack that can be delivered from either the left or right. This allows you to quickly shift directions, making it useful for repositioning. Silkbind Shockwave: A Silkbind attack that wraps your weapon in Ironsilk. For a short period of time, any attack performed causes the silk to vibrate, creating a time-delayed shockwave that triggers additional hits. These additional hits do major stun, exhaust, and part damage.\nSunbreak Insect Glaive Switch Skills Two new moves have been added alongside Sunbreak. Here’s what each one does: Building up the meter in Axe mode is tantamount to Switch Axe Play, you will be wanting to charge up Sword Mode as soon as possible to deal the most amount of damage. Axe Mode\nAxe Mode combos allow for wide reach, whether you’re dealing with multiple small monsters or looking to hit a flying monster. The Wild Swing lets you combo ad infinitum, which is great for building up meter Your basic infinite combo is great for building up meter so that you can morph to Sword Mode. It should primarily be used for building up the meter into Sword Mode, or evading while sheathed. For Silkbind attacks, press ZL and X to perform an Invincible Gambit, a spinning charge attack that also makes you immune to flinching or knockback. This costs one wirebug to use. Press ZL and A to perform a Switch Charger. You’ll perform a forward wiredash while quickly regenerating your Switch gauge, which also won’t decrease for a short time.\nSword Mode\nSword Mode allows you to use the weapon’s innate Phials which can range from Power, Exhaust and Elemental, dependent on what you have equipped, which can deal huge damage when fully discharged pressing X and A. Slow movement is made up for with the sidestep, which is excellent for repositioning mid-battle. Using your Sword Combos allows you to enter ‘Amped State’ - Where your Sword will glow and deal additional Phial Damage. You can also change Switch Skills so that pressing ZL and X lets you perform Soaring Wyvern Blade, press X while in midair to dive down with an Advancing Slash. If this connects, the weapon’s activation gauge fills up and triggers a large explosion.\nKinsect Slash: A mid-air technique where you thrust forward with your glaive and Kinsect. If the slash connects, you’ll perform a Vaulting Dance, absorbing extract. However, once you’ve absorbed red extract with Kinsect Slash, you won’t be able to absorb any other extract with it, but you’ll be able to perform an Enhanced Insect Spiker as a trade-off. Awakened Kinsect Attack: A technique where you hurl a Kinsect to inflict massive damage. All extracts are consumed and the more extract you have, the more potent this attack will be. After launching the Kinsect, you’ll close in using a Wirebug; simultaneously absorbing extract, marking the target, and then chaining into a Vaulting Dance.\nSunbreak Heavy Bowgun New Switch Skills Crouching Shot: A style of shooting that utilizes a special stance to reduce recoil. In exchange for not being able to move, you’re able to fire in rapid succession. The longer you fire, the shorter the firing interval becomes, but at the risk of overheating your bowgun. If your bowgun overheats, it can’t be fired until it has cooled down. Setting Sun: A Silkbind technique in which a Wirebug generates a ring of Ironsilk. Special powder accumulates within the ring, and when ammo passes through it, the velocity of the ammo is decreased. Firing piercing ammo/multi-hit ammo through the ring will boost the total number of hits upon impact.\nSunbreak Charge Blade Switch Skills Phial Follow-Up (Firing Pin): A mechanism that lowers the pressure of elemental energy generated through Shield Thrust during Elemental Boost, or by sword attacks while in Sword Boost Mode. Ready Stance: A Silkbind maneuver that binds sword and axe together with Ironsilk. After guarding, a heavy knockback leaves you in Sword Mode, and lowers your guard reaction so you’re able to chain sword/axe attacks.\nStake Thrust: An attack that thrusts an explosive stake into your target. The stake reacts to follow-up attacks, dealing extra damage to the target. The amount of extra damage dealt is determined by type of arrow loosed. Butcher’s Bind: Fires an arrow loaded with Ironsilk. If the follow-up arrow lands in the same spot as the first, Ironsilk winds around both arrows, inflicting severing damage.\nLearn how to start Sunbreak - the first expansion - and from there, how to unlock Master Rank, use Switch Skill swap, and progress onward with our Monster Hunter Sunbreak walkthrough.\rThere’s also a monsters list, as well as individual pages on beating Garangolm, Lunagaron and Shogun Ceanataur.\rFor the base game, we have a number of Monster Hunter Rise tips and lists of ore locations, bone locations, weapon types, how to use Insect Glaives and Kinsects, details of how to join friends in multiplayer, how to capture monsters and learn about wirebugs and great wirebugs.\rHowever, to utilise Axe Mode, you will be needing to charge the Phials in the top right using Sword and Shield Mode. While complex and difficult to master, the Charge Blade does the biggest damage of any weapon in the game.\nCharging up Element Phials allows you to enter Axe Mode, which you can discharge for huge amounts of damage. You are able to charge up your attacks with a huge amount of options in Sword and Shield mode, which should be the primary mode for this weapon, then utilising Axe Mode in order to discharge all of your innate Phials. Charging your sword is important as is timing. Hold down the charge for too long and certain attacks will not execute properly. Similarly, building up too much Sword Energy will also result in sword attacks bouncing off. You can enter Sword Boost Mode when you perform a Condensed Elemental Slash during an Elemental Boost, which will prevent your sword from deflecting while giving you extra attacks. In Axe Modem with at least one phial applied, you can perform an Elemental Roundslash your provides an elemental boost to your shield that improves power and guard capacity.\nPhial Types (Elemental or Abnormal Damage) are dependent upon what kind of Charge Blade you have equipped. A wide and varied combat style means that the Charge Blade can be used with great evasion skills. Sword Mode should be used for building up Phials, with the shield also having a move to build up your phials using a complex guard-point system. Some attacks have blocking frames where your shield is facing forward. Timed correctly, you’ll automatically block an attack, which also charges up Axe Mode. For Switch Skills, you have a standard Condensed Element Slash that is charged up after putting your sword in the charging position. Changing this to the Condensed Spinning Slash which turns your weapon into a buzzsaw.\nPress ZL and X to perform Morphing Advance. This Silkbind attack costs one wirebug and launches you forward while switching your Charge Blade to axe mode and makes you invincible to any monster attacks while in motion. Press ZL and A to activate Counter Peak Performance, which automatically refills your phials to max if hit in this stance. This costs two wirebugs to use. This is a more advanced weapon, and usually recommended for players who are familiar with Monster Hunter, as there is a lot of Meter Management, timing and mechanics involved. With the defence of a Lance, speed of the Dual Blades and Attack Power within a hair’s length of the Greatsword, the Charge Blade is one of the most versatile weapons in the game.\nShield Tackle: A technique where you charge forward with your shield raised. You can also follow up with a variety of thrusting attacks. Watch for an opening and then unleash an unrelenting series of attacks. Skyward Thrust: A technique where a Wirebug launches you high into the air. Thrust your lance towards the heavens and then pierce the earth.\nFor more help on Monster Hunter Rise, check out our in-depth Insect Glaive page, wirebug guide, Jewel lilies locations and how to use Traps and Tranq Bombs to catch monsters.\n","wordCount":"2898","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-08T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-08T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ted May"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-weapon-types-list-best-beginner-weapons-and-weapon-combos-explained/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak Weapon Types List Best Beginner Weapons And Weapon Combos Explained</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-08 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 8, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2898 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Ted May</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#sunbreak-sword-and-shield-switch-skills>Sunbreak Sword and Shield Switch Skills</a></li><li><a href=#sunbreak-dual-blades-new-switch-skills>Sunbreak Dual Blades new Switch Skills</a></li><li><a href=#sunbreak-new-light-bowgun-switch-skills>Sunbreak new Light Bowgun Switch Skills</a></li><li><a href=#sunbreak-long-sword-switch-skills>Sunbreak Long Sword Switch Skills</a></li><li><a href=#monster-hunter-sunbreak-hammer-switch-skills>Monster Hunter Sunbreak Hammer Switch Skills</a></li><li><a href=#sunbreak-gunlance-switch-skills>Sunbreak Gunlance Switch Skills</a></li><li><a href=#sunbreak-switch-axe-new-switch-skills>Sunbreak Switch Axe new Switch Skills</a></li><li><a href=#sunbreak-hunting-horn-new-skills>Sunbreak Hunting Horn New Skills</a></li><li><a href=#sunbreak-insect-glaive-switch-skills>Sunbreak Insect Glaive Switch Skills</a></li><li><a href=#sunbreak-heavy-bowgun-new-switch-skills>Sunbreak Heavy Bowgun New Switch Skills</a></li><li><a href=#sunbreak-charge-blade-switch-skills>Sunbreak Charge Blade Switch Skills</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>This page has a full list of every type, in order of the game&rsquo;s recommendation for beginners to more advanced players, and details of what makes them different from the next.

These insects produce a special glowing silk thread hunters can use as a grapple, though you can just grapple thin air and wiredash, giving the game greater verticality than ever before, while expanding aerial combat previously limited to a select couple weapons.
That may seem a little less significant now that mounting monsters has been replaced by wyvern-riding, but it still diversifies your combat options.
Wirebugs also allow you to execute special Silkbind Attacks, which are unique to each weapon type. Most of these are actually based on the Hunter Arts introduced in Monster Hunter Generations but they&rsquo;re easier to use, while their relatively quick cooldown makes them more viable to use regularly in a hunt compared to the previous Arts.
To perform a Silkbind Attack, unsheathe your weapon and press either ZL and X or ZL and A. For ranged weapons, this will be mapped to R and X or R and A. Depending on the move, Silkbind Attacks cost either one or two wirebugs. Some weapon types will also have multiple Silkbind Attacks, which depend on the Switch Skills that are unlocked.</p><p>Twin Blade Combo: A two-part attack that opens with a circular slash and follows up with a blade thrust. An easy attack to get multiple hits in with, so ideal for weapons with high elemental and status properties. Destroyer Oil: Uses a Wirebug to cover your blade with a special ointment whose effects trigger if ignited by friction with your shield. Increases Flinching damage.</p><h3 id=sunbreak-dual-blades-new-switch-skills>Sunbreak Dual Blades new Switch Skills<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sunbreak-dual-blades-new-switch-skills>#</a></h3><p>The following skills have been added for Dual Blades players as part of Monster Hunter Sunbreak:</p><p>Side Slash Combo: This technique allows you to attack while evading, and if you work it into your combos, you can unleash a relentless attack that&rsquo;s difficult to defend against. Spiral Slash: A Silkbind attack that launches you spiraling forwards. Once your attack connects, your body acts as a drill as your blades bore into your target&rsquo;s flesh.</p><h3 id=sunbreak-new-light-bowgun-switch-skills>Sunbreak new Light Bowgun Switch Skills<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sunbreak-new-light-bowgun-switch-skills>#</a></h3><p>Here are the new Light Bowgun moves added for Sunbreak:</p><p>Critical Firepower: A special shooting style that further raises damage output but narrows critical distance and increases recoil. Because the distance at which the power of ammo is most effective has been reduced, you will need to be aware and adjust your firing position. Wyvern Counter: An urgent retreat that fires a shot with massive recoil, using a Wirebug to stop. While not a powerful attack, its true value comes when it&rsquo;s used to evade incoming attacks.</p><p>Surge Slash Combo: An offensive style that combines speed with the weight of the weapon to unleash a stream of powerful slashes. Strongarm Stance: A technique that uses Ironsilk to reinforce both your arms and weapon temporarily to fend off attacks. If used while charging, you can quickly parry an attack and then unleash a fierce onslaught afterwards.</p><h3 id=sunbreak-long-sword-switch-skills>Sunbreak Long Sword Switch Skills<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sunbreak-long-sword-switch-skills>#</a></h3><p>Sacred Sheathe Combo: A slow methodical movement that can be executed following an attack.Upon sheathing your weapon, you can harness the increased spirit to unleash a follow-up slash. The power of the slash increases according to the level of the Spirit Gauge. If you are attacked before you have finished with the sheathe, it will consume one level of Spirit Gauge and the move will be cancelled. Harvest Moon: A move that casts out an Ironsilk ring that narrows your range of attack, but boosts spirit so you can go on the offensive. Within the ring, your Spirit Gauge won&rsquo;t deplete, and if you perform any counter attacks, it will add additional hits.</p><h3 id=monster-hunter-sunbreak-hammer-switch-skills>Monster Hunter Sunbreak Hammer Switch Skills<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#monster-hunter-sunbreak-hammer-switch-skills>#</a></h3><p>Spinning Bludgeon (Charge): A technique that stores released power and funnels it into the next Charge Switch attack. Power is built up when performing a Spinning Bludgeon. The charge level is then maintained when executing a Charge Switch. Impact Burst: A Silkbind attack that wraps your weapon in Ironsilk. For a short period of time, any charged attack performed causes the silk to vibrate, creating a shockwave that makes it easier to flinch monsters.</p><h3 id=sunbreak-gunlance-switch-skills>Sunbreak Gunlance Switch Skills<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sunbreak-gunlance-switch-skills>#</a></h3><p>You&rsquo;ll need to master these two new moves if you plan on using the Gunlance in Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak:</p><p>Erupting Cannon: This technique involves firing an exploding stake into your target. When using the Eruption Cannon, the tip of the gunlance heats up and slashing attacks are enhanced for a certain period of time. Bullet Barrage: Uses a Wirebug to Blast Dash toward your target, unleashing everything with abandon.</p><h3 id=sunbreak-switch-axe-new-switch-skills>Sunbreak Switch Axe new Switch Skills<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sunbreak-switch-axe-new-switch-skills>#</a></h3><p>2-Staged Morph Slash Combo: A two-staged Morph Slash attack that follows an Axe: Wild Swing. Elemental Burst Counter: Compresses Switch Gauge energy, that can be released as an Elemental Burst. If the burst is released right as a monster attacks, you&rsquo;ll perform a Power Finisher and your switch axe will go into an Amped State.</p><h3 id=sunbreak-hunting-horn-new-skills>Sunbreak Hunting Horn New Skills<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sunbreak-hunting-horn-new-skills>#</a></h3><p>Swing Combo: A two-hit attack that can be delivered from either the left or right. This allows you to quickly shift directions, making it useful for repositioning. Silkbind Shockwave: A Silkbind attack that wraps your weapon in Ironsilk. For a short period of time, any attack performed causes the silk to vibrate, creating a time-delayed shockwave that triggers additional hits. These additional hits do major stun, exhaust, and part damage.</p><h3 id=sunbreak-insect-glaive-switch-skills>Sunbreak Insect Glaive Switch Skills<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sunbreak-insect-glaive-switch-skills>#</a></h3><p>Two new moves have been added alongside Sunbreak. Here&rsquo;s what each one does:
Building up the meter in Axe mode is tantamount to Switch Axe Play, you will be wanting to charge up Sword Mode as soon as possible to deal the most amount of damage.
Axe Mode</p><p>Axe Mode combos allow for wide reach, whether you&rsquo;re dealing with multiple small monsters or looking to hit a flying monster. The Wild Swing lets you combo ad infinitum, which is great for building up meter Your basic infinite combo is great for building up meter so that you can morph to Sword Mode. It should primarily be used for building up the meter into Sword Mode, or evading while sheathed. For Silkbind attacks, press ZL and X to perform an Invincible Gambit, a spinning charge attack that also makes you immune to flinching or knockback. This costs one wirebug to use. Press ZL and A to perform a Switch Charger. You&rsquo;ll perform a forward wiredash while quickly regenerating your Switch gauge, which also won&rsquo;t decrease for a short time.</p><p>Sword Mode</p><p>Sword Mode allows you to use the weapon&rsquo;s innate Phials which can range from Power, Exhaust and Elemental, dependent on what you have equipped, which can deal huge damage when fully discharged pressing X and A. Slow movement is made up for with the sidestep, which is excellent for repositioning mid-battle. Using your Sword Combos allows you to enter &lsquo;Amped State&rsquo; - Where your Sword will glow and deal additional Phial Damage. You can also change Switch Skills so that pressing ZL and X lets you perform Soaring Wyvern Blade, press X while in midair to dive down with an Advancing Slash. If this connects, the weapon&rsquo;s activation gauge fills up and triggers a large explosion.</p><p>Kinsect Slash: A mid-air technique where you thrust forward with your glaive and Kinsect. If the slash connects, you&rsquo;ll perform a Vaulting Dance, absorbing extract. However, once you&rsquo;ve absorbed red extract with Kinsect Slash, you won&rsquo;t be able to absorb any other extract with it, but you&rsquo;ll be able to perform an Enhanced Insect Spiker as a trade-off. Awakened Kinsect Attack: A technique where you hurl a Kinsect to inflict massive damage. All extracts are consumed and the more extract you have, the more potent this attack will be. After launching the Kinsect, you&rsquo;ll close in using a Wirebug; simultaneously absorbing extract, marking the target, and then chaining into a Vaulting Dance.</p><h3 id=sunbreak-heavy-bowgun-new-switch-skills>Sunbreak Heavy Bowgun New Switch Skills<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sunbreak-heavy-bowgun-new-switch-skills>#</a></h3><p>Crouching Shot: A style of shooting that utilizes a special stance to reduce recoil. In exchange for not being able to move, you&rsquo;re able to fire in rapid succession. The longer you fire, the shorter the firing interval becomes, but at the risk of overheating your bowgun. If your bowgun overheats, it can&rsquo;t be fired until it has cooled down. Setting Sun: A Silkbind technique in which a Wirebug generates a ring of Ironsilk. Special powder accumulates within the ring, and when ammo passes through it, the velocity of the ammo is decreased. Firing piercing ammo/multi-hit ammo through the ring will boost the total number of hits upon impact.</p><h3 id=sunbreak-charge-blade-switch-skills>Sunbreak Charge Blade Switch Skills<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sunbreak-charge-blade-switch-skills>#</a></h3><p>Phial Follow-Up (Firing Pin): A mechanism that lowers the pressure of elemental energy generated through Shield Thrust during Elemental Boost, or by sword attacks while in Sword Boost Mode. Ready Stance: A Silkbind maneuver that binds sword and axe together with Ironsilk. After guarding, a heavy knockback leaves you in Sword Mode, and lowers your guard reaction so you&rsquo;re able to chain sword/axe attacks.</p><p>Stake Thrust: An attack that thrusts an explosive stake into your target. The stake reacts to follow-up attacks, dealing extra damage to the target. The amount of extra damage dealt is determined by type of arrow loosed. Butcher&rsquo;s Bind: Fires an arrow loaded with Ironsilk. If the follow-up arrow lands in the same spot as the first, Ironsilk winds around both arrows, inflicting severing damage.</p><p>Learn how to start Sunbreak - the first expansion - and from there, how to unlock Master Rank, use Switch Skill swap, and progress onward with our Monster Hunter Sunbreak walkthrough.
There&rsquo;s also a monsters list, as well as individual pages on beating Garangolm, Lunagaron and Shogun Ceanataur.

However, to utilise Axe Mode, you will be needing to charge the Phials in the top right using Sword and Shield Mode.
While complex and difficult to master, the Charge Blade does the biggest damage of any weapon in the game.</p><p>Charging up Element Phials allows you to enter Axe Mode, which you can discharge for huge amounts of damage. You are able to charge up your attacks with a huge amount of options in Sword and Shield mode, which should be the primary mode for this weapon, then utilising Axe Mode in order to discharge all of your innate Phials. Charging your sword is important as is timing. Hold down the charge for too long and certain attacks will not execute properly. Similarly, building up too much Sword Energy will also result in sword attacks bouncing off. You can enter Sword Boost Mode when you perform a Condensed Elemental Slash during an Elemental Boost, which will prevent your sword from deflecting while giving you extra attacks. In Axe Modem with at least one phial applied, you can perform an Elemental Roundslash your provides an elemental boost to your shield that improves power and guard capacity.</p><p>Phial Types (Elemental or Abnormal Damage) are dependent upon what kind of Charge Blade you have equipped. A wide and varied combat style means that the Charge Blade can be used with great evasion skills. Sword Mode should be used for building up Phials, with the shield also having a move to build up your phials using a complex guard-point system. Some attacks have blocking frames where your shield is facing forward. Timed correctly, you&rsquo;ll automatically block an attack, which also charges up Axe Mode. For Switch Skills, you have a standard Condensed Element Slash that is charged up after putting your sword in the charging position. Changing this to the Condensed Spinning Slash which turns your weapon into a buzzsaw.</p><p>Press ZL and X to perform Morphing Advance. This Silkbind attack costs one wirebug and launches you forward while switching your Charge Blade to axe mode and makes you invincible to any monster attacks while in motion. Press ZL and A to activate Counter Peak Performance, which automatically refills your phials to max if hit in this stance. This costs two wirebugs to use. This is a more advanced weapon, and usually recommended for players who are familiar with Monster Hunter, as there is a lot of Meter Management, timing and mechanics involved. With the defence of a Lance, speed of the Dual Blades and Attack Power within a hair&rsquo;s length of the Greatsword, the Charge Blade is one of the most versatile weapons in the game.</p><p>Shield Tackle: A technique where you charge forward with your shield raised. You can also follow up with a variety of thrusting attacks. Watch for an opening and then unleash an unrelenting series of attacks. Skyward Thrust: A technique where a Wirebug launches you high into the air. Thrust your lance towards the heavens and then pierce the earth.</p><p>For more help on Monster Hunter Rise, check out our in-depth Insect Glaive page, wirebug guide, Jewel lilies locations and how to use Traps and Tranq Bombs to catch monsters.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/monster_hunter_rise_weapon_types_0.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/monster_hunter_rise_weapon_types_0.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Monster Hunter Rise  Sunbreak weapon types list  best beginner weapons and weapon combos explained -
