It’s a heady mix, and arguably director Hidetaka Miyazaki’s strongest game yet; come the end of the generation, it’s really between this and Breath of the Wild as to which was the greatest game of the era. A boy nurses an injured beast back to health, and then boy and beast make their way through a vast, almost deserted kingdom. From dank grottos to spindly peaks of sun-bleached stone, this is a journey as much as it’s a game. And as much as it’s a journey it’s also a rumination - on companionship and complicity and the kindness we owe the living things around us. Spidey’s Manhattan is a wonderful playground, and also a site of some lovingly crafted fan-service. Cameos and collectibles abound, while the heart of the game blends combat and traversal - and characterisation - in a way that has never been better. What a glorious game. Showers of cash flutter across the screen when you successfully complete a fight, and there’s an extra seediness to Yakuza’s already tawdry world. It’s outstanding, and a welcome reminder that the Sega you once loved never really went away. But GTA 5 is still an astonishing piece of work, offering an island that feels hand-crafted down to each metre of tarmac and three protagonists who are going to be very hard for the series to top or even move beyond. In 2019 we know that all of this comes at a steep human cost. GTA 5 is a deeply problematic masterpiece, an example of the staggering highs and extreme lows of modern video games It’s an easy enough proposition to grasp - on the one side you’ve got the classic puzzler in all its glory, and on the other there’s the rhythm action chops of the people that brought you Rez, Child of Eden and Lumines. Yet in that mix Tetris Effect manages to become so much more; a meditation on life and love, or simply the ultimate chill-out experience. Oh, and if you try it in PlayStation VR then it’s something else entirely… For all that Gran Turismo lost, though, it gained an awful lot more; a sense of focus, as driving experts Polyphony set about creating a serious racing game for arguably the first time. It’s an approachable iRacing for console, basically, and it works brilliantly. The PlayStation 4 isn’t short of great racing games - and a shout-out, in particular, to Codemasters’ excellent F1 games and Dirt Rally 2.0 - but Gran Turismo Sport sees Polyphony reclaim its position at the head of the pack. Arcade isn’t dead, of course, regardless of what Housemarque has said of late. And Nex Machina, the death machine, is a brilliant argument for why arcade games will live forever. Want to read more? See our full Nex Machina review. What Remains of Edith Finch is at once fantastical and far-fetched but never anything other than utterly, winningly human - and it pushes at the boundaries of video game storytelling in a way that anyone with even a passing interest in the medium simply has to experience for themselves.

But the surfaces are always deceptive and the connections between one place and another are always surprising. Hohokum is a puzzle, a toy and an adventure. In other words, it’s a video game, and an absolute blinder too. Want to read more? See our full Hohokum review, and buy it from PSN. They’re so beautiful you almost don’t want to spend 30 minutes chasing around, bonking them on the nose with a switch axe so that you might make a fancy pair of trousers out of them. Almost. It’s for the best, though, that the pull of Monster Hunter’s core loop has never been stronger, and at long last the world beyond Japan seems to have opened its eyes to the majesty of Capcom’s series. What marks Fortnite out, though, is that it supports so many different play styles, from people who want to shoot to people who want to build and - brilliantly - people who just want to ramble around one of the most engaging video game settings yet made. Fortnite’s world changes, which makes the density of memories it holds feel that much more special. Other games are better shooters, but none can match this one for its sheer power of place. Want to read more? See our Digital Foundry’s appraisal of Fortnite on Android, iOS and Switch. As a piece of digital tourism it’s peerless - so what a bonus to have a well-crafted story thrown into the mix, alongside the constant threat of the lone xenomorph that hunts you down. Alien: Isolation sadly never got the success it deserved, but that doesn’t stop it being an outstanding adventure and one of the PS4’s very best. Want to read more?
