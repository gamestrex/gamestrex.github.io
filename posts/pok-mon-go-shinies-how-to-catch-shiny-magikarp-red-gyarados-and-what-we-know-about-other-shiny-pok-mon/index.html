Shinies are notoriously rare, as any veteran of the main series will gladly tell you, so what do we know about Pokémon Go Shinies, and how do you catch them? On this page: They won’t appear as a different colour in the field, so you have to attempt to catch them first. They of course can also appear in anywhere you’d find a Pokémon, not just the wild - so that includes hatching Eggs, Research task rewards and Raid bonus challenges. A Shiny creature is extremely rare, so it’s simply a case of checking every one you are looking for - such as Magikarp - in the hope it will be a different colour. Often, the variation is somewhat subtle. You can see the difference in Magikarp in the above comparison image, courtesy of Silph Road subreddit user skinnysnorlaz. Though the list has expanded greatly since the arrival of Magikarp and Red Gyarados, the number is small compared to the number of non-shiny creatures in the game. At a glance, here is every possible shiny creature you can get in the game right now (aside from additions since early February - you can see a more up-to-date list in chronological order later in the article) and their rarity according to a user survey (thanks to AirbenderProdigy on reddit for the research and image): Shiny Pikachu: August 2017’s Pokémon Go Park event in Japan revealed the second set of Shinies. Those within the event radius had a chance of catching a Shiny Pikachu, which much like the Red Gyarados, could also be evolved into a shiny Raichu. These have since been made available around the world, and was expanded on with a shiny hatted Pikachu as part of the 2018 Pokémon Day. Shiny Gen 3 Ghosts: As the Halloween event in 2018 - which introduced the first Gen 3 creatures - rolled on, shiny variations of all five new creatures (Duskull, Dusclops, Shuppet, Sableye and Banette) started to appear. Here is a video of shiny Duskull in action: Shiny Gen 3 Raids: With the arrival of 50 Gen 3 creatures in December 2017 came two Raid-specific catches, both of which offering Shiny versions. The remaining 48 also have Shiny models in the game code, though none have been found so far. Shiny Gen 3 Desert update: The Aron family of creatures all have shiny variants as part of their release in the Janary 2018 Gen 3 Desert update. Shiny Gen 3 Dragon update: Swablu is one of the few creatures available as a shiny Pokémon, changing its blue body colour into yellow. Evolving into Altaria will keep that same yellow colour scheme, as shown in this video by Cychreus Gaming: Valentine’s Day 2018: Alongside increased Luvdisc spawns came a shiny version: Otherwise, there are no other signs more Shinies will be added. The main games had shinies for every single creature, so there’s a chance every one in Pokémon Go will offer them at some point, but it makes sense Niantic would want to drip feed them for special occasions and make them more of an event. Lunar New Year event 2018: The increase in dog and dog-like spawns saw the introduction of a shiny Poochyena: Community Day: The creature a Community Day focuses on will release a shiny version at the same time. So far we’ve had:\nDratini (and evolutions Dragonair and Dragonite) Bulbasaur (and evolutions Ivysaur and Venusaur) Mareep (and evolutions Flaaffy and Ampharos) Charmander (and evolutions Charmeleon and Charizard) Larvitar (and evolutions Pupitar and Tyranitar) Squirtle (and evolutions Wartortle and Blastoise) Eevee (and evolutions Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon, Espeon, Umbreon) Chikorita (and evolutions Bayleef and Meganium) Beldum (and evolutions Metang and Metagross) Cyndaquil (and evolutions Quilava and Typhlosion) Totodile (and evolutions Croconaw, Feraligatr) Piplup (and evolutions Prinplup and Empoleon)\n2018 Shinies came thick and fast, including:\nMagby (and Magmar) Togepi (and evolution Togetic), and Wynaut (and evolution Wobbuffet) for Easter event Eggstravaganza Murkrow (for April Fools’ Day) Lugia (brought back for a limited time), and now Ho-oh in the same manner.

part of the January Community Day Dedenne as part of the Twinkling Fantasy event in January 2023\nThe Season of Mythical Wishes continues with the Winter Holiday event, which has brought Mega Glalie to Pokémon Go. Don’t forget to partake in the new Go Battle League season. Elsewhere, be sure to use Daily Adventure Incense for the chance of encountering Galarian Articuno, Galarian Zapdos and Galarian Moltres.\nShiny Pokémon are independent - in other words, two people can go to the same place and catch the same Magikarp, which has the same stats and IVs, but they won’t necessarily both be Shiny. This is generally seen as a good thing by the community: it means people won’t all be rushing to the same place after a Shiny is spotted, and ‘spoofers’ who cheat the system to change their location won’t be able to instantly grab a Shiny as soon as one is located. Shiny Pokémon can also be other ‘states’ of creatures - meaning they can also be Lucky, Shadow and Purified. Shiny Pokémon’s evolutions will be Shiny too - the good news, at least, is that Shiny Pokémon will evolve into Shiny Pokémon. So that means a gold Magikarp will turn into a red Gyarados when evolved, and so on. Another reason to hold onto those Candies for any Pokémon you encounter! Shinies have their own entries in the Pokédex - Once you have found a Shiny, visit that creature in the Pokédex and you can view its unique appearance, alongside any gender differences. The following image by Dronpes explains this in closer detail:\nShiny Pokémon show up as standard colour Pokémon on the map - they only reveal themselves as Shiny once you start the battle sequence with them, which means checking every Pokémon you see now if you want to find Shinies, even if you’ve already caught plenty of that Pokémon! There’s a new warning if you try to transfer a Shiny - if you try and send a Shiny to Professor Willow, you’ll get an additional pop-up warning checking that you definitely want to transfer this Shiny Pokémon. A nice touch to stop any fat finger issues!\nThat’s all the important info you need - the rest of it is down to good old fashioned luck, so it’s time get searching!\n","wordCount":"4247","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dominique Coviello"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/pok-mon-go-shinies-how-to-catch-shiny-magikarp-red-gyarados-and-what-we-know-about-other-shiny-pok-mon/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Pok Mon Go Shinies How To Catch Shiny Magikarp Red Gyarados And What We Know About Other Shiny Pok Mon</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 1, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;20 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;4247 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Dominique Coviello</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>More recent months have seen the reveal of new shinies, including Shiny Pikachu, with more unique variants over time.
Shinies are notoriously rare, as any veteran of the main series will gladly tell you, so what do we know about Pokémon Go Shinies, and how do you catch them?
On this page:
They won&rsquo;t appear as a different colour in the field, so you have to attempt to catch them first.
They of course can also appear in anywhere you&rsquo;d find a Pokémon, not just the wild - so that includes hatching Eggs, Research task rewards and Raid bonus challenges.
A Shiny creature is extremely rare, so it&rsquo;s simply a case of checking every one you are looking for - such as Magikarp - in the hope it will be a different colour.
Often, the variation is somewhat subtle. You can see the difference in Magikarp in the above comparison image, courtesy of Silph Road subreddit user skinnysnorlaz.
Though the list has expanded greatly since the arrival of Magikarp and Red Gyarados, the number is small compared to the number of non-shiny creatures in the game.
At a glance, here is every possible shiny creature you can get in the game right now (aside from additions since early February - you can see a more up-to-date list in chronological order later in the article) and their rarity according to a user survey (thanks to AirbenderProdigy on reddit for the research and image):
Shiny Pikachu: August 2017&rsquo;s Pokémon Go Park event in Japan revealed the second set of Shinies.
Those within the event radius had a chance of catching a Shiny Pikachu, which much like the Red Gyarados, could also be evolved into a shiny Raichu.
These have since been made available around the world, and was expanded on with a shiny hatted Pikachu as part of the 2018 Pokémon Day.
Shiny Gen 3 Ghosts: As the Halloween event in 2018 - which introduced the first Gen 3 creatures - rolled on, shiny variations of all five new creatures (Duskull, Dusclops, Shuppet, Sableye and Banette) started to appear.
Here is a video of shiny Duskull in action:
Shiny Gen 3 Raids: With the arrival of 50 Gen 3 creatures in December 2017 came two Raid-specific catches, both of which offering Shiny versions. The remaining 48 also have Shiny models in the game code, though none have been found so far.
Shiny Gen 3 Desert update: The Aron family of creatures all have shiny variants as part of their release in the Janary 2018 Gen 3 Desert update.
Shiny Gen 3 Dragon update: Swablu is one of the few creatures available as a shiny Pokémon, changing its blue body colour into yellow.
Evolving into Altaria will keep that same yellow colour scheme, as shown in this video by Cychreus Gaming:
Valentine&rsquo;s Day 2018: Alongside increased Luvdisc spawns came a shiny version:
Otherwise, there are no other signs more Shinies will be added. The main games had shinies for every single creature, so there&rsquo;s a chance every one in Pokémon Go will offer them at some point, but it makes sense Niantic would want to drip feed them for special occasions and make them more of an event.
Lunar New Year event 2018: The increase in dog and dog-like spawns saw the introduction of a shiny Poochyena:
Community Day: The creature a Community Day focuses on will release a shiny version at the same time.

debut in Pokémon Go throughout 2023:</p><p>Chespin (Quilladin and Chesnaught) on Saturday, 7th January as part of the January Community Day Dedenne as part of the Twinkling Fantasy event in January 2023</p><p>The Season of Mythical Wishes continues with the Winter Holiday event, which has brought Mega Glalie to Pokémon Go. Don&rsquo;t forget to partake in the new Go Battle League season.
Elsewhere, be sure to use Daily Adventure Incense for the chance of encountering Galarian Articuno, Galarian Zapdos and Galarian Moltres.</p><p>Shiny Pokémon are independent - in other words, two people can go to the same place and catch the same Magikarp, which has the same stats and IVs, but they won&rsquo;t necessarily both be Shiny. This is generally seen as a good thing by the community: it means people won&rsquo;t all be rushing to the same place after a Shiny is spotted, and &lsquo;spoofers&rsquo; who cheat the system to change their location won&rsquo;t be able to instantly grab a Shiny as soon as one is located. Shiny Pokémon can also be other &lsquo;states&rsquo; of creatures - meaning they can also be Lucky, Shadow and Purified. Shiny Pokémon&rsquo;s evolutions will be Shiny too - the good news, at least, is that Shiny Pokémon will evolve into Shiny Pokémon. So that means a gold Magikarp will turn into a red Gyarados when evolved, and so on. Another reason to hold onto those Candies for any Pokémon you encounter! Shinies have their own entries in the Pokédex - Once you have found a Shiny, visit that creature in the Pokédex and you can view its unique appearance, alongside any gender differences. The following image by Dronpes explains this in closer detail:</p><p>Shiny Pokémon show up as standard colour Pokémon on the map - they only reveal themselves as Shiny once you start the battle sequence with them, which means checking every Pokémon you see now if you want to find Shinies, even if you&rsquo;ve already caught plenty of that Pokémon! There&rsquo;s a new warning if you try to transfer a Shiny - if you try and send a Shiny to Professor Willow, you&rsquo;ll get an additional pop-up warning checking that you definitely want to transfer this Shiny Pokémon. A nice touch to stop any fat finger issues!</p><p>That&rsquo;s all the important info you need - the rest of it is down to good old fashioned luck, so it&rsquo;s time get searching!</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/pokemon-go-shinies-how-to-catch-shiny-magikarp-red-gyarados-and-how-shinies-work-149026396466.png/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/pokemon-go-shinies-how-to-catch-shiny-magikarp-red-gyarados-and-how-shinies-work-149026396466.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Pok mon Go Shinies   how to catch Shiny Magikarp  Red Gyarados  and what we know about other Shiny Pok mon - 14"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/pokemon_go_shiny_tier_list.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/pokemon_go_shiny_tier_list.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Pok mon Go Shinies   how to catch Shiny Magikarp  Red Gyarados  and what we know about other Shiny Pok mon - 30"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/pokemon_go_shiny_pikachu.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/pokemon_go_shiny_pikachu.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Pok mon Go Shinies   how to catch Shiny Magikarp  Red Gyarados  and what we know about other Shiny Pok mon - 99"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/1490263785.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/1490263785.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Pok mon Go Shinies   how to catch Shiny Magikarp  Red Gyarados  and what we know about other Shiny Pok mon - 40"></p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/pok-mon-go-getting-official-companion-app-with-messaging-meetup-organisation/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Pok Mon Go Getting Official Companion App With Messaging Meetup Organisation</span></a>
