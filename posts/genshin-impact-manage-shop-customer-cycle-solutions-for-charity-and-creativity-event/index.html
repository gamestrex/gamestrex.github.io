You can get rewards such as Primogems for reaching certain milestones every day when managing the shop, and there’s also rewards for obtaining one million business earnings over the course of every day combined. The event throws a lot of information your way, so we’ve got every customer cycle solution of the Genshin Impact Charity and Creativity event below to help you out. On this page:\nGenshin Impact Charity and Creativity event explained To gain access to the Charity and Creativity event as part of Of Ballads and Brews, you need to be at least Adventure Rank 21 and have completed Razor’s ‘Lupus Minor Chapter: Act 1 - The Meaning of Lupical’ Story Quest. Once you complete ‘Sounds From Afar’, the first act of this event story quest, you will then gain access to the four mini-events that make up Of Ballad and Brews, including Charity and Creativity, when each becomes available. The Of Ballads and Brews event runs until Monday, 17th October, and as for the gameplay itself, you’ll have to secure funds to open the shop before you can manage it. This involves completing two short quests in which you have to negotiate wine ingredient prices, and selling some of your own personally collected ingredients to the wine sellers at the festival. If you need some help locating these ingredients, we’ve got pages on Dandelion Seeds locations and Valberry locations. Once you’ve opened the shop and had a conversation with Fischl and Mona, you’re free to start making business earnings! For each day of customer cycles, you’ll now have to manage your funds into three different priorities: product quality, business efficiency, and holistic service. Adjusting these three sliders while applying the correct Shop Stratagems until they’re just right will result in you getting more ‘Business Earnings’, and more rewards.\rAt a certain point you’ll also be able to hire your Genshin Impact friends as assistants to help you out, but don’t worry, this isn’t required in order to unlock every reward. When ‘Charity Alliance’ is unlocked, you will then be running three shops. Each share the same Stratagems, so you’ll have to balance who needs what the most. To make sure you get all the rewards you can while managing customer cycles in Charity and Creativity, we’ve got the correct solutions for each slider and Shop Stratagem below. There are other solutions to the customer cycles, and you may get more cycles depending on how well you managed the shops - but these are the solutions that unlocked every reward for us. Please note that we’re not including shop assistant solutions as they are only available to those who have a lot of players taking part in the event on their friends list. Using them will make the cycles easier, but is not necessary.\nGenshin Impact Charity and Creativity Manage Shop customer cycle solutions Day 1 There are ten customer cycle solutions in Day 1 of Charity and Creativity, and you can earn a total of x60 Primogems, x60 Festive Fever, 90,000 Mora, and x15 Ascension materials for getting at least 80,000 business earnings. Here’s every customer cycle solution for Day 1 of Charity and Creativity in Genshin Impact:\nDay 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 1 No Shop Stratagems available yet, so all you have to do is spend your business earnings until they reach the marked bar:\nProduct quality - 800 Business efficiency - 800 Holistic service - 400\nTotal business earnings consumed: 2,000.\nDay 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 2 Again, no Shop Stratagems available yet, so just spend your business earnings until they reach the marked bar:\nProduct quality - 800 Business efficiency - 400 Holistic service - 400\nTotal business earnings consumed: 1,600.\nDay 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 3 Now that you’ve unlocked a Shop Stratagem slot, select ‘Attentive Service’ under the ‘Service’ tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:\nProduct quality - 800 Business efficiency - 400 Holistic service - 400\nTotal business earnings consumed: 1,600.\nDay 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 4 Select ‘Attentive Service’ under the ‘Service’ tab and ‘A Steady Hand’ under the ‘Quality’ tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:\nProduct quality - 450 Business efficiency - 800 Holistic service - 400\nTotal business earnings consumed: 1,650.\nDay 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 5 Select ‘The Cost of Artisanry’ under the ‘Quality’ tab and ‘Attentive Service’ under the ‘Service’ tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:\nProduct quality - 900 Business efficiency - 1750 Holistic service - 1600\nTotal business earnings consumed: 4,250.\nDay 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 6 For the unexpected situation questions, you can probably answer anything, but if you want to be safe, we answered ‘What was he drinking?’ and ‘Put a Cryo Slime in each of the boxes’. This is the point where you unlock assistants, so if you can use them here, we recommend doing so - but if you can’t, you’ll still be able to get all the rewards for Day 1 by following the solutions below. Select ‘A Steady Hand’ under the ‘Quality’ tab and ‘Freestyle Reception’ under the ‘Service’ tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:\nProduct quality - 450 Business efficiency - 1,350 Holistic service - 450\nTotal business earnings consumed: 2,250.\nDay 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 7 Select ‘Apt Efficiency’ under the ‘Efficiency’ tab and ‘Proper Product Quality’ under the ‘Quality’ tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:\nProduct quality - 1,350 Business efficiency - 900 Holistic service - 2,250\nTotal business earnings consumed: 4,500.\nDay 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 8 Select ‘Focused Management’ under the ‘Efficiency’ tab, then ‘Quality Control Margins’ under the ‘Quality’ tab, and ‘Freestyle Reception’ under the ‘Service’ tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:\nProduct quality - 2,000 Business efficiency - 0 Holistic service - 0\nTotal business earnings consumed: 2,000.\nDay 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 9 For the unexpected event, select the ‘Better check the package’ option when it appears. If you weren’t following along with the solutions above and haven’t earned a total of 80,000 business earnings yet, then we actually recommend using the ‘Zero-Cost Trial and Error’ Stratagem under ‘Feedback’ in place of one of the noted Stratagems below. This will give you 10,000 extra business earnings for each customer cycle if you are under this business earnings total. If you have been following along, then you just need to select ‘The Price of Speed’ under the ‘Efficiency’ tab, then ‘The Cost of Artisanry’ under the ‘Quality’ tab, and ‘Attentive Service’ under the ‘Service’ tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:\nProduct quality - 0 Business efficiency - 450 Holistic service - 1,800\nTotal business earnings consumed: 2,250.\nDay 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 10 Select ‘Focused Management’ under the ‘Efficiency’ tab, and ‘Proper Product Quality’ and ‘A Steady Hand’ under the ‘Quality’ tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:\nProduct quality - 1,650 Business efficiency - 2,200 Holistic service - 900\nTotal business earnings consumed: 4,750. If you’ve followed along with our customer cycle solutions then you’ll have around 95,000 business earnings (dependent on how much you carried over from the raising funds quest), which will unlock all the Charity and Creativity Day 1 rewards, and you’ll be just under 10% of that one million business earnings total goal for the event. Genshin Impact version 3.3 is here, with new codes, and new character Scaramouche (Wanderer), so find out where he’s placed on our tier list. You’ll need Primogems and luck of the Pity and 50/50 systems to Wish with Fate for him and other current and next banners. You’ll also need the right Adventure Rank for events. For more Sumeru help, we’ve got pages on Sumeru Reputation, Tree of Dreams, Dendroculus locations, the Aeonblight Drake boss, the Garden of Endless Pillars Domain, and locations for Nilotpala Lotus, Padisarah, Scarabs, and Redcrest.\rYou can also now unlock the Genius Invokation TCG and, if you want help building your deck, check out our Genius Invokation TCG Card List.\rIf you want to relax, however, why not try fishing at one of the many fishing spot locations?\nGenshin Impact Charity and Creativity Manage Shop customer cycle solutions Day 2 Day 2 is where things start to get a little tricky in Charity and Creativity, as you’ll be simultaneously managing three shops for each customer cycle. Each has their own personal targets, and you’ll need to unlock Shop Stratagem slots for each store (which all share the Stratagems between them). As a reminder, this guide isn’t taking Shop Assistants into account, as it requires friends playing the same event in Genshin Impact. So you will be able to spend less business earnings than that noted below if you are using your friends as shop assistants (which we recommend doing so if you can). Also keep in mind that there are other solutions to the customer cycles in Charity and Creativity, but this is what worked for us, and unlocked all of the event’s rewards. Here’s every customer cycle solution for Day 2 of Charity and Creativity in Genshin Impact:\nDay 2 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 11 Select ‘Focused Management’ under the ‘Efficiency’ tab, and ‘Proper Product Quality’ and ‘The Cost of Artisanry’ under the ‘Quality’ tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:\nProduct quality - 2,200 Business efficiency - 2,200 Holistic service - 550\nNo Shop Stratagems available yet, so all you have to do is spend your business earnings until they reach the marked bar:\nProduct quality - 550 Business efficiency - 900 Holistic service - 700\nNo Shop Stratagems available yet, so all you have to do is spend your business earnings until they reach the marked bar:\nProduct quality - 700 Business efficiency - 550 Holistic service - 900\nTotal business earnings consumed: 9,250.\nDay 2 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 12 Select ‘Focused Management’ under the ‘Efficiency’ tab, and ‘A Steady Hand’ and ‘The Cost of Artisanry’ under the ‘Quality’ tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:\nProduct quality - 1,650 Business efficiency - 2,500 Holistic service - 1,100\nStill no Shop Stratagems available yet, so all you have to do is spend your business earnings until they reach the marked bar:\nProduct quality - 550 Business efficiency - 1,800 Holistic service - 5,600\nStill no Shop Stratagems available yet, so all you have to do is spend your business earnings until they reach the marked bar:\nProduct quality - 1,400 Business efficiency - 1,100 Holistic service - 4,500\nTotal business earnings consumed: 20,200.\nDay 2 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 13 Select ‘Focused Management’ under the ‘Efficiency’ tab, and ‘A Steady Hand’ and ‘The Cost of Artisanry’ under the ‘Quality’ tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:\nProduct quality - 3,350 Business efficiency - 2,100 Holistic service - 550\nFor the emergency situation, choose ‘How about using Anemograna’, then use the currency you get to unlock a Stratagem slot at the General Goods shop.

class=post-content><hr><p>After securing funds to open up a shop as part of the Weinlesefest celebrations in Of Ballads and Brews, you&rsquo;ll then have to balance your business funds during multiple customer cycles in the &lsquo;Manage Shop&rsquo; section of the event.
You can get rewards such as Primogems for reaching certain milestones every day when managing the shop, and there&rsquo;s also rewards for obtaining one million business earnings over the course of every day combined. The event throws a lot of information your way, so we&rsquo;ve got every customer cycle solution of the Genshin Impact Charity and Creativity event below to help you out.
On this page:</p><h2 id=genshin-impact-charity-and-creativity-event-explained>Genshin Impact Charity and Creativity event explained<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-charity-and-creativity-event-explained>#</a></h2><p>To gain access to the Charity and Creativity event as part of Of Ballads and Brews, you need to be at least Adventure Rank 21 and have completed Razor&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lupus Minor Chapter: Act 1 - The Meaning of Lupical&rsquo; Story Quest.
Once you complete &lsquo;Sounds From Afar&rsquo;, the first act of this event story quest, you will then gain access to the four mini-events that make up Of Ballad and Brews, including Charity and Creativity, when each becomes available.
The Of Ballads and Brews event runs until Monday, 17th October, and as for the gameplay itself, you&rsquo;ll have to secure funds to open the shop before you can manage it. This involves completing two short quests in which you have to negotiate wine ingredient prices, and selling some of your own personally collected ingredients to the wine sellers at the festival.
If you need some help locating these ingredients, we&rsquo;ve got pages on Dandelion Seeds locations and Valberry locations.
Once you&rsquo;ve opened the shop and had a conversation with Fischl and Mona, you&rsquo;re free to start making business earnings!
For each day of customer cycles, you&rsquo;ll now have to manage your funds into three different priorities: product quality, business efficiency, and holistic service. Adjusting these three sliders while applying the correct Shop Stratagems until they&rsquo;re just right will result in you getting more &lsquo;Business Earnings&rsquo;, and more rewards.
At a certain point you&rsquo;ll also be able to hire your Genshin Impact friends as assistants to help you out, but don&rsquo;t worry, this isn&rsquo;t required in order to unlock every reward.
When &lsquo;Charity Alliance&rsquo; is unlocked, you will then be running three shops. Each share the same Stratagems, so you&rsquo;ll have to balance who needs what the most.
To make sure you get all the rewards you can while managing customer cycles in Charity and Creativity, we&rsquo;ve got the correct solutions for each slider and Shop Stratagem below. There are other solutions to the customer cycles, and you may get more cycles depending on how well you managed the shops - but these are the solutions that unlocked every reward for us.
Please note that we&rsquo;re not including shop assistant solutions as they are only available to those who have a lot of players taking part in the event on their friends list. Using them will make the cycles easier, but is not necessary.</p><h2 id=genshin-impact-charity-and-creativity-manage-shop-customer-cycle-solutions-day-1>Genshin Impact Charity and Creativity Manage Shop customer cycle solutions Day 1<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-charity-and-creativity-manage-shop-customer-cycle-solutions-day-1>#</a></h2><p>There are ten customer cycle solutions in Day 1 of Charity and Creativity, and you can earn a total of x60 Primogems, x60 Festive Fever, 90,000 Mora, and x15 Ascension materials for getting at least 80,000 business earnings.
Here&rsquo;s every customer cycle solution for Day 1 of Charity and Creativity in Genshin Impact:</p><h3 id=day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-1>Day 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 1<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-1>#</a></h3><p>No Shop Stratagems available yet, so all you have to do is spend your business earnings until they reach the marked bar:</p><p>Product quality - 800 Business efficiency - 800 Holistic service - 400</p><p>Total business earnings consumed: 2,000.</p><h3 id=day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-2>Day 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 2<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-2>#</a></h3><p>Again, no Shop Stratagems available yet, so just spend your business earnings until they reach the marked bar:</p><p>Product quality - 800 Business efficiency - 400 Holistic service - 400</p><p>Total business earnings consumed: 1,600.</p><h3 id=day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-3>Day 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 3<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-3>#</a></h3><p>Now that you&rsquo;ve unlocked a Shop Stratagem slot, select &lsquo;Attentive Service&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Service&rsquo; tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:</p><p>Product quality - 800 Business efficiency - 400 Holistic service - 400</p><p>Total business earnings consumed: 1,600.</p><h3 id=day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-4>Day 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 4<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-4>#</a></h3><p>Select &lsquo;Attentive Service&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Service&rsquo; tab and &lsquo;A Steady Hand&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Quality&rsquo; tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:</p><p>Product quality - 450 Business efficiency - 800 Holistic service - 400</p><p>Total business earnings consumed: 1,650.</p><h3 id=day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-5>Day 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 5<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-5>#</a></h3><p>Select &lsquo;The Cost of Artisanry&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Quality&rsquo; tab and &lsquo;Attentive Service&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Service&rsquo; tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:</p><p>Product quality - 900 Business efficiency - 1750 Holistic service - 1600</p><p>Total business earnings consumed: 4,250.</p><h3 id=day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-6>Day 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 6<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-6>#</a></h3><p>For the unexpected situation questions, you can probably answer anything, but if you want to be safe, we answered &lsquo;What was he drinking?&rsquo; and &lsquo;Put a Cryo Slime in each of the boxes&rsquo;. This is the point where you unlock assistants, so if you can use them here, we recommend doing so - but if you can&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll still be able to get all the rewards for Day 1 by following the solutions below.
Select &lsquo;A Steady Hand&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Quality&rsquo; tab and &lsquo;Freestyle Reception&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Service&rsquo; tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:</p><p>Product quality - 450 Business efficiency - 1,350 Holistic service - 450</p><p>Total business earnings consumed: 2,250.</p><h3 id=day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-7>Day 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 7<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-7>#</a></h3><p>Select &lsquo;Apt Efficiency&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Efficiency&rsquo; tab and &lsquo;Proper Product Quality&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Quality&rsquo; tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:</p><p>Product quality - 1,350 Business efficiency - 900 Holistic service - 2,250</p><p>Total business earnings consumed: 4,500.</p><h3 id=day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-8>Day 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 8<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-8>#</a></h3><p>Select &lsquo;Focused Management&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Efficiency&rsquo; tab, then &lsquo;Quality Control Margins&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Quality&rsquo; tab, and &lsquo;Freestyle Reception&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Service&rsquo; tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:</p><p>Product quality - 2,000 Business efficiency - 0 Holistic service - 0</p><p>Total business earnings consumed: 2,000.</p><h3 id=day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-9>Day 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 9<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-9>#</a></h3><p>For the unexpected event, select the &lsquo;Better check the package&rsquo; option when it appears.
If you weren&rsquo;t following along with the solutions above and haven&rsquo;t earned a total of 80,000 business earnings yet, then we actually recommend using the &lsquo;Zero-Cost Trial and Error&rsquo; Stratagem under &lsquo;Feedback&rsquo; in place of one of the noted Stratagems below. This will give you 10,000 extra business earnings for each customer cycle if you are under this business earnings total.
If you have been following along, then you just need to select &lsquo;The Price of Speed&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Efficiency&rsquo; tab, then &lsquo;The Cost of Artisanry&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Quality&rsquo; tab, and &lsquo;Attentive Service&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Service&rsquo; tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:</p><p>Product quality - 0 Business efficiency - 450 Holistic service - 1,800</p><p>Total business earnings consumed: 2,250.</p><h3 id=day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-10>Day 1 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 10<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#day-1-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-10>#</a></h3><p>Select &lsquo;Focused Management&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Efficiency&rsquo; tab, and &lsquo;Proper Product Quality&rsquo; and &lsquo;A Steady Hand&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Quality&rsquo; tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:</p><p>Product quality - 1,650 Business efficiency - 2,200 Holistic service - 900</p><p>Total business earnings consumed: 4,750.
If you&rsquo;ve followed along with our customer cycle solutions then you&rsquo;ll have around 95,000 business earnings (dependent on how much you carried over from the raising funds quest), which will unlock all the Charity and Creativity Day 1 rewards, and you&rsquo;ll be just under 10% of that one million business earnings total goal for the event.
Genshin Impact version 3.3 is here, with new codes, and new character Scaramouche (Wanderer), so find out where he&rsquo;s placed on our tier list.
You&rsquo;ll need Primogems and luck of the Pity and 50/50 systems to Wish with Fate for him and other current and next banners. You&rsquo;ll also need the right Adventure Rank for events. For more Sumeru help, we&rsquo;ve got pages on Sumeru Reputation, Tree of Dreams, Dendroculus locations, the Aeonblight Drake boss, the Garden of Endless Pillars Domain, and locations for Nilotpala Lotus, Padisarah, Scarabs, and Redcrest.
You can also now unlock the Genius Invokation TCG and, if you want help building your deck, check out our Genius Invokation TCG Card List.
If you want to relax, however, why not try fishing at one of the many fishing spot locations?</p><h2 id=genshin-impact-charity-and-creativity-manage-shop-customer-cycle-solutions-day-2>Genshin Impact Charity and Creativity Manage Shop customer cycle solutions Day 2<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-charity-and-creativity-manage-shop-customer-cycle-solutions-day-2>#</a></h2><p>Day 2 is where things start to get a little tricky in Charity and Creativity, as you&rsquo;ll be simultaneously managing three shops for each customer cycle. Each has their own personal targets, and you&rsquo;ll need to unlock Shop Stratagem slots for each store (which all share the Stratagems between them).
As a reminder, this guide isn&rsquo;t taking Shop Assistants into account, as it requires friends playing the same event in Genshin Impact. So you will be able to spend less business earnings than that noted below if you are using your friends as shop assistants (which we recommend doing so if you can).
Also keep in mind that there are other solutions to the customer cycles in Charity and Creativity, but this is what worked for us, and unlocked all of the event&rsquo;s rewards.
Here&rsquo;s every customer cycle solution for Day 2 of Charity and Creativity in Genshin Impact:</p><h3 id=day-2-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-11>Day 2 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 11<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#day-2-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-11>#</a></h3><p>Select &lsquo;Focused Management&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Efficiency&rsquo; tab, and &lsquo;Proper Product Quality&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Cost of Artisanry&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Quality&rsquo; tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:</p><p>Product quality - 2,200 Business efficiency - 2,200 Holistic service - 550</p><p>No Shop Stratagems available yet, so all you have to do is spend your business earnings until they reach the marked bar:</p><p>Product quality - 550 Business efficiency - 900 Holistic service - 700</p><p>No Shop Stratagems available yet, so all you have to do is spend your business earnings until they reach the marked bar:</p><p>Product quality - 700 Business efficiency - 550 Holistic service - 900</p><p>Total business earnings consumed: 9,250.</p><h3 id=day-2-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-12>Day 2 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 12<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#day-2-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-12>#</a></h3><p>Select &lsquo;Focused Management&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Efficiency&rsquo; tab, and &lsquo;A Steady Hand&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Cost of Artisanry&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Quality&rsquo; tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:</p><p>Product quality - 1,650 Business efficiency - 2,500 Holistic service - 1,100</p><p>Still no Shop Stratagems available yet, so all you have to do is spend your business earnings until they reach the marked bar:</p><p>Product quality - 550 Business efficiency - 1,800 Holistic service - 5,600</p><p>Still no Shop Stratagems available yet, so all you have to do is spend your business earnings until they reach the marked bar:</p><p>Product quality - 1,400 Business efficiency - 1,100 Holistic service - 4,500</p><p>Total business earnings consumed: 20,200.</p><h3 id=day-2-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-13>Day 2 Charity and Creativity Customer Cycle 13<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#day-2-charity-and-creativity-customer-cycle-13>#</a></h3><p>Select &lsquo;Focused Management&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Efficiency&rsquo; tab, and &lsquo;A Steady Hand&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Cost of Artisanry&rsquo; under the &lsquo;Quality&rsquo; tab in Shop Stratagems, then adjust the sliders to:</p><p>Product quality - 3,350 Business efficiency - 2,100 Holistic service - 550</p><p>For the emergency situation, choose &lsquo;How about using Anemograna&rsquo;, then use the currency you get to unlock a Stratagem slot at the General Goods shop.
