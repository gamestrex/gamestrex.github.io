Autumn Crisis is a combat challenge in which you are only able to use your normal attacks in - but you can pick up helpful bonus around the area to help get rid of the boars and complete stages of this task. Highwind Trial is another combat challenge, only this time you have to use a special ‘Sublime Anemograna’ to get buffs in order to defeat the tough enemies. Charity and Creativity is a completely different experience, tasking you with running a shop! You’ll have to complete some small quests to actually get the shop up and running, then when your shop is open, you’ll have to manage your funds into three different priorities: product quality, business efficiency, and holistic service. Adjusting these three sliders until they’re just right will result in you earning more ‘Business Earnings’. You’ll also be able to hire assistants to help you out. Fecund Blessings is another sort of treasure-hunt challenge where you have to follow clues in order to locate ‘Fecund Hampers’ (chests) scattered about Teyvat. These hampers contain lots of different types of rewards, including decorations you can actually use to fulfil commissions for your shop in Charity and Creativity. The rewards you can receive from Of Ballads and Brews include:\n4-Star Missive Windspear polearm Plume of the Changing Winds weapon refinement material (for Missive Windspear) Primogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Crown of Insight Character Ascension Materials Weapon Ascension Materials Character EXP Materials Talent Level-Up Materials\nGenshin Impact Hyakunin Ikki event The Hyakunin Ikki event during 3.1 starts on Monday, 10th October, and ends on Monday, 24th October. You must be at least Adventure Rank 30 and have completed the ‘Ritou Escape Plan’ to take part, which is part of the Chapter 2, Act 1 Archon quest ‘The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia’. The Hyakunin Ikki is a returning event, taking place in Inazuma. These six combat challenges release one a day for six days, and divide twelve of your characters (or trial characters) into teams of two, for six teams in total. You can switch between characters and teams during the combat challenges, which you are encouraged to take advantage of, as a team’s combat ability will decrease the longer they’re on the field. Each team can also have up to two Secret Arts, which can provide special buffs. The rewards you can earn from the Hyakunin Ikki event include:\nPrimogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Weapon Ascension Materials Talent Level-Up Materials\nGenshin Impact Path of the Gleaming Jade sign-in event Path of the Gleaming Jade starts on Friday, 14th October and ends on Monday, 31st October. You need to be Adventure Rank 5 in order to take part.

There are also other rewards as part of the Path of the Gleaming Jade event, like Mora, Mystic Enhancement Ore, and Hero’s Wit.

In Star Seeker’s Sojourn, you need to equip an event-exclusive gadget to search for ‘Future Stars’ and help out a child called Banu. It’s another type of treasure-hunt challenge, as your gadget will indicate if a Future Star is nearby when you get closer to one, helping you to narrow down the search area.

You can switch between characters and teams during the combat challenges, which you are encouraged to take advantage of, as a team&rsquo;s combat ability will decrease the longer they&rsquo;re on the field.
Each team can also have up to two Secret Arts, which can provide special buffs.
The rewards you can earn from the Hyakunin Ikki event include:</p><p>Primogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Weapon Ascension Materials Talent Level-Up Materials</p><h3 id=genshin-impact-path-of-the-gleaming-jade-sign-in-event>Genshin Impact Path of the Gleaming Jade sign-in event<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-path-of-the-gleaming-jade-sign-in-event>#</a></h3><p>Path of the Gleaming Jade starts on Friday, 14th October and ends on Monday, 31st October. You need to be Adventure Rank 5 in order to take part.
This is the easiest event to complete in Genshin Impact 3.1, as you only need to sign-in for a total of seven days in order to get ten Intertwined Fate! There are also other rewards as part of the Path of the Gleaming Jade event, like Mora, Mystic Enhancement Ore, and Hero&rsquo;s Wit.
You should also check your mailbox regularly during 3.1, as you&rsquo;ll receive an impressive 1,600 Primogems, x4 Fragile Resin, and two commemorative gadgets in honour of Genshin Impact&rsquo;s second anniversary.</p><h3 id=genshin-impact-wind-chaser-event>Genshin Impact Wind Chaser event<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-wind-chaser-event>#</a></h3><p>Wind Chaser starts on Monday, 17th October and ends on Monday, 31st October. You need to be at least Adventure Rank 20 in order to take part.
The Wind Chaser event in Genshin Impact 3.1 is a domain challenge, where you&rsquo;ll need to create wind currents to navigate through its floating platforms in &lsquo;Galezones&rsquo;, similar to the character domains in the Summertime Odyssey event, only this time you need to collect &lsquo;Wind Coins&rsquo; amongst other tasks. Wind Chaser can also be experienced with a friend in co-op.
The rewards you can receive from Wind Chaser include:</p><p>Primogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Character EXP Materials Talent Level-Up Materials</p><h3 id=genshin-impact-star-seekers-sojourn-event>Genshin Impact Star-Seeker&rsquo;s Sojourn event<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-star-seekers-sojourn-event>#</a></h3><p>Star-Seeker&rsquo;s Sojourn starts on Friday, 21st October and ends on Monday, 31st October. You need to be at least Adventure Rank 30 in order to take part. It&rsquo;s also recommended to have completed Chapter 3, Act 1 &lsquo;Through the Mists of Smoke and Forests Dark&rsquo; Archon Quest to appreciate the story - but is not required, as you can &lsquo;Quick Start&rsquo; it from the &lsquo;Events&rsquo; menu.
In Star Seeker&rsquo;s Sojourn, you need to equip an event-exclusive gadget to search for &lsquo;Future Stars&rsquo; and help out a child called Banu. It&rsquo;s another type of treasure-hunt challenge, as your gadget will indicate if a Future Star is nearby when you get closer to one, helping you to narrow down the search area.
The rewards you can earn from the Star-Seeker&rsquo;s Sojourn event include:</p><p>Primogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Character EXP Materials Talet level-up materials Weapon Ascension Materials</p><h2 id=genshin-impact-31-release-time-in-uk-cest-edt-and-pdt>Genshin Impact 3.1 release time in UK, CEST, EDT and PDT<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-31-release-time-in-uk-cest-edt-and-pdt>#</a></h2><p>Re-confirmed during the 3.1 livestream, developer miHoYo revealed that Genshin Impact 3.1 will release on Wednesday, 28th September.
