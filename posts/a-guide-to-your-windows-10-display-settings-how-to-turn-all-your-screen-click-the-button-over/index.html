On the bottom of this screen there is a slider button in order to prevent apps from becoming blurr. This can sometimes happen when the scaling happens. Despite it being good, Windows 10s scaling presets work very well.

You can also change those models, which would be useful if you want to show one of them to a group and to navigate the laptop screen facing you. Show only on 1 and Show only on 2, and this will only show Windows on the primary or secondary display (1).
If you have a multimonitor setup, Windows 10 can display in the top of the Settings > System > Display screen a graph showing the number of monitors Windows 10 detects.

Since you’ve gone to the multi-level section, there’s an extension with the smallest screen size. It takes you to the second page where you can view the different monitors. There’s a drop-down menu that lists your display.
There is a display information option, which displays a range of information, including resolution, refresh rate, bit depth, color format and color space. If you need to adjust these attributes, please click the link below to display information labeled Display adapter properties for display 1. These will change depending on which display you’ve set to view settings for. If, for example, you switched to the view of the settings of your secondary monitor, then the link would say Display adapter properties for display 2.
Clicking this link will open the properties window by clicking the icon on the screen where you can set the maximum rate of recharge, change the display, and change the color management settings.

After that, open the control panel and go to the settings cog to open the Settings app. You can, too, hit the Key+I in the Windows Key. Click the Display button. Now let’s dive in.</p><h3 id=settings--system--display--color--settings--system--display--color--settings-system--system--display--color--color--system-gt-1>Settings > System > Display > Color > Settings > System > Display > Color > Settings >System > System > Display > Color > Color > System &gt.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#settings--system--display--color--settings--system--display--color--settings-system--system--display--color--color--system-gt-1>#</a></h3><p>The light has the night. The nightlight should filter the blue light flowing through your display so you can rest easily on your computer. We won’t get into the argument for or against this proposition, but if you want this option, that’s where it’s at.

It’s easier to turn the night light on or off. The dark lights feature under the slider. You can activate the nightlight by changing on. It’s below the slider. Adjusts the nightlight to the strongest. Turning it up lowers the amount of blue in the monitor and the amount of red light aspires to it. Turning it all the way down will bring it to its normal state. By default night light is set to about 50 percent.
Finally, this second screen has option on Schedule. The time the night light is active by tapping the button on the slider. By default, the planned time will be on as follows.
By setting up your schedule, you will need the set duration radio button. There are two simple options. Turn on, where you can set the time by AM/PM; and then turn off, using the same interface.
To go back to the main page of Settings and System, hit the back button in the upper-left corner.</p><h3 id=settings--system--display--windows-720p-colors-1>Settings > System > Display > Windows 720p Colors.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#settings--system--display--windows-720p-colors-1>#</a></h3><p>If you have a HDR monitor, you can adjust your display. First, you should see a screen button labeled “Sure HDR”. Turn on that. If you don’t see this slider, you should probably enable HDR in your monitors onboard. How it’s going, depends on your monitors, so consult your manual and see how the computer is turning on HDR.
The link “Test colors” shows how HDR works. This takes you to a second page, with some options only when the HDR is occupied.
