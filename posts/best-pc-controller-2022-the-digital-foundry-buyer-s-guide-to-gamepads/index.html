In this article, we will answer that question by making our picks for the best PC gaming controllers on the market, including some you might not have considered. As a little bonus, we’re also recommending the best gamepads we’ve tested for iOS and Android. How did we choose? We used each of the controllers listed for at least two weeks - and in some cases, years - testing them in games like Horizon Zero Dawn, Forza Horizon 5 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider. We evaluated each gamepad in terms of its suitability for different PC gaming genres, its ease of use and its depth of features. We made one overall best pick that should suit most people, with additional picks for different criteria - like spending a lot or a little, gaming on titles that don’t feature native controller support and gaming on both phones and PCs.

Scroll down to see the full round-up, or click the links below to skip ahead!\nBest PC controller: Xbox Wireless Controller Runner-up: Sony DualSense (PS5) Controller Best premium PC controller: Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller Best cheap controller for PC gaming: Xbox 360 Controller Best third-party PC controller: Razer Wolverine V2 Runner-up third-party PC controller: Astro C40 TR Best small PC controller: Nacon Rig Pro Compact Most customisable PC controller: Scuf Instinct / Instinct Pro Runner-up customisable controller: Victrix Gambit Best controller for PC, iOS and Android: SteelSeries Stratus Duo Best MFi controller for iPhone and iPad: SteelSeries Nimbus+ Best controller for Android: PowerA Moga XP5-X Plus Best of the rest: other controllers we tested\nHowever, the controller does have its downsides. Rather than charging via a Micro USB cable, the Xbox Series controller takes AA batteries, requiring a £20/$25 Play and Charge Kit to support USB recharging. In addition, most PCs don’t support Microsoft’s low-latency 2.4GHz wireless out of the box, requiring a £20/$25 Wireless Adapter for wireless connectivity. Pros\nUnparalleled support in PC games, without requiring third-party software Low-latency 2.4GHz wireless connection plus Bluetooth Available in a range of colours and styles\nCons\nEats AA batteries by default, with a rechargeable battery sold separately\nFor a cheaper Xbox-oriented alternative that’s wired only, consider the Turtle Beach Recon. It works well across a wide version of PC games and boasts a surprising number of features for a £50 controller, including a pair of remappable rear buttons, multiple modes, and textured grips. You also get convenient audio controls for anything you plug into the 3.5mm port, making it a savvy way of making a basic headset feel a lot more premium. If that mix of features sounds worthwhile, we’d recommend it over the standard Xbox controller - although giving up wireless is still tough! The only minor inconvenience is that you need to install third-party software to get the controller working on Windows. Thankfully, the DS4Windows software is free, easy to use and offers options not found on Xbox Accessories app. You can also use Steam’s Big Picture mode, which supports the DualSense natively, for both Steam and non-Steam games. The first custom PS5 controllers are also slowly becoming available, including from Scuf and MegaModz. We tested a custom DualSense controller from MegaModz with a custom shell, mechanical shoulder/face buttons, and interchangeable thumbsticks. The controller feels fantastic to use, thanks to those mechanical upgrades, and it’s nice to see a PS5 controller that looks so different from the standard colour options too. Of course, custom controllers don’t come cheap, but if you spend a lot of time playing controller-friendly games on PC and PS5 then it could well be worth the upgrade over the standard DualSense. Pros\nComfortable, high-quality controller with incredible triggers Doesn’t require batteries or a dongle to work wirelessly Trackpad is convenient if your mouse isn’t nearby\nCons\nRequires third-party driver installation to work well Button prompts often conflict with controller layout Expensive - but DualShock 4 is also available for less\nThe Series 2 also improves on its predecessor with a more modern design equivalent to the most recent standard Xbox One controller, including Bluetooth connectivity, a headphone jack and USB-C charging via the included stand or a USB-C cable. The rechargeable battery used here is arguably more convenient than the previous system that used AA batteries, but it’s also not user replaceable. In total though, the generational changes here are overwhelmingly positive - and you can read more in our Elite Controller Series 2 review. Sadly, the Series 2 has not had the cleanest launch, with some users facing quality control issues out of the box such as face buttons working intermittently or sticks drifting - not what you’d expect from a premium product. The Elite Series 2 is still good enough that we recommend it, but we’d encourage you to test it thoroughly after purchase and buy from a retailer with a solid return policy. Microsoft itself offers a warranty of 90 days in the US and Canada, or one year in the UK, so do take advantage of it if your unit develops any problems. Pros\nIncredible levels of hardware and software customisation Comfortable, precise feel with excellent tactile feedback Includes creature comforts like Bluetooth and USB-C charging\nCons\nDurability issues are concerning for a high-end product Rechargeable battery isn’t user replaceable\nPros\nAvailable used for bargain basement prices Widely supported by PC games\nCons\nErgonomics and tactility doesn’t match newer controllers Wireless models require Wireless Gaming Receiver for wireless connectivity on PC\nThe controller can be customised in the Razer Controller Setup for Xbox app, available on Xbox and PC, where you can rebind the buttons and dial in the Wolverine’s sensitivity. While the Wolverine V2 costs more than a standard first-party controller, it is still a significant upgrade that’s well worth considering if you play a lot of gamepad-friendly PC games. Pros\nBest software for remapping and customisation Well-constructed with tight, tactile and often clicky controls\nCons\nExpensive for a wired controller (although cheaper than the Wolverine TE) Lacks the metal components of the similarly-priced Xbox One Elite controller\nIf you do dip into the software, you’re in for a treat - there’s plenty of settings to adjust here, from trigger sensitivity to stick dead zones, and the interface is intuitive enough that you won’t mind setting up a new profile for your next game. Connectivity is handled via a 2.4GHz wireless USB dongle, with the option for a wired Micro USB connection if you’d prefer. Battery life was excellent in our testing, with the C40 TR only requiring a couple of top-ups in weeks of use. The package is completed with a hard case for the controller and its accessories. If you play on both PS4 and PC and you’re willing to invest in a premium controller, this is a worthy choice. Pros\nWell-constructed with responsive controls and clicky shoulder buttons Deep customisation and intuitive software\nCons\nLacks the extra clicky face buttons of the Razer Wolverine Not guaranteed to work with the PlayStation 5\nPros\nConveniently compact frame for the small-handed Dolby Atmos for Headphones license included for Xbox and PC Short-throw triggers (good for shootin’)\nCons\nWired only (no wireless) Menu button dangerously close to face buttons Short-throw triggers (not so good for driving)\nThe Instinct series use the same circuit board as Microsoft’s controllers and pair in the same way, so on PC you can use them wired via USB-C, via Bluetooth or via lower-latency Xbox Wireless with an Xbox Wireless Adapter dongle. It also means they benefit to Microsoft’s latency improvements and can even be upgraded with new firmware as it’s released. Both Instinct gamepads also feature three profiles, allowing you to customise the controller on a per-game basis by tapping a button, and a button for muting the headset. Compared to the similarly expensive Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, it’s hard to pick a favourite. The Elite Series 2 feels more substantial in the hand, with clickier buttons and more conveniently placed triggers, but the Instinct Pro is lighter, with even shorter-throw triggers and a smoother chassis. I think I would normally come down for the Elite Series 2, but that controller’s reliability woes would give me some pause - and the Instinct Pro’s customisable look makes it a distinct option in its own right. Pros\nCan be customised for a look and feel entirely your own Instinct Pro variant offers hair triggers and extra grip Works just like the official Xbox Series X/S controller\nCons\nExtremely expensive once fully customised Face buttons and d-pad aren’t quite as good as the best controllers from Microsoft or Razer\nPros\nExcellent range of customisation options included Good build quality makes the controller a pleasure to use Works just like the official Xbox Series X/S controller\nCons\nLayout of some less-used buttons is unorthodox Cool transparent body is hidden by the top plates No wireless connectivity\nPros\nCan connect via 2.4Ghz wireless (PC) or Bluetooth (mobile) Good option for mobile VR gaming\nCons\nSmartGrip accessory for mounting onto your phone costs $10 Relatively short battery life on Bluetooth\nPros\nTactile and responsive d-pad and buttons Convenient iPhone clip is included in the box\nCons\nRelatively large size means this isn’t the most portable option\nUnfortunately, support for wired controllers in native Android games can be hit or miss, with Bluetooth gamepads like the Xbox One controller seemingly being supported in a greater number of games. It’s worth researching your favourite titles online before pulling the trigger if it’s these native games that are motivating you to consider a gamepad. Still, for the games that support it, the Moga XP5-X offers a big improvement to tactility and control. As an alternative, consider the Razer Kishi. It offers a different form factor, clipping around your phone to resemble an oversize Nintendo Switch. There are a lot of clever touches here, like a USB-C pass-through port that allows for charging and gaming at the same time, plus a wide frame that accommodates all but the very largest mobiles like the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. However, the spongey buttons aren’t up to Razer’s usual tip-top standards, costing this option the top slot. Pros\nComfortable form factor for mobile gaming Being able to charge your phone while gaming is a nice touch Extremely useful in emulators, cloud gaming and supported Android games\nCons\nFinding the perfect balance point for your phone Not exactly a pocketable option, although it’s portable enough\nPowerA Spectra Enhanced Wired Xbox One Controller: At £30, this gamepad is about £15 cheaper than the official Microsoft Xbox One controller. You lose out on wireless connectivity and a tiny bit of build quality, but you gain edge and button lighting in seven colours, two programmable rear buttons and three-tier trigger locks. The trigger locks didn’t work perfectly in our testing, with the most restrictive setting on both triggers resulting in different amounts of movement, but otherwise the controller delivers a reasonable gaming experience and looks good doing it. If the extra features are worthwhile for you and you’re not interested in wireless connectivity, then this is a decent choice. Thrustmaster eSwap Pro: Another solid take on the modular controller concept, this controller only barely misses out on a full place on our round-up. While the clicky buttons and tool-free hot-swappable modules are exceptional, the small rear buttons are harder to use than those of the Astro C40 TR and there’s no option for wireless connectivity or hair triggers. Still, given its lower price than the C40 TR, it’s worth considering. Nintendo Switch Pro Controller: This is a good first-party controller with excellent battery life, but it is more expensive than its competitors and doesn’t offer any compelling unique features beyond Switch compatibility and a cool see-through design. Razer Raiju Mobile: While the Raiju Mobile sports clicky buttons, good ergonomics and a built-in smartphone clip, its unusual default bindings on PC require manual remapping in each game. By contrast, the SteelSeries Stratus Duo works well on PC out of the box. Microsoft Elite Controller (Series 1): The first-gen Elite was a great controller, but the Elite Series 2 offers more features and a better tactile feel at the same price. Only consider this one if you can find it in working order at a good price, or if the lack of a user-replaceable battery in the Series 2 is a deal-breaker for you. Nacon Pro Controller 3: The design and build quality of this controller is subpar, with flabby shoulder buttons and lethargic sticks, but the real issue is the placement of the extra buttons. Rather than paddles, Nacon has opted for a quartet of small buttons built into the lower grips. This is convenient, in that you can reach these buttons comfortably, but they’re all-too-easy to set off accidentally and hard to differentiate. That makes the NPC3 a hard sell in a competitive premium controller market. Razer Wildcat: Razer’s previous-generation Xbox controller is hard to find new, but it can still be a decent choice if you can find it used for a good price. However, the Razer Wolverine offers better ergonomics and a more stylish design. So, there you have it. We will continue to evaluate new gamepads and controllers to keep our recommendations up to date, and we welcome your feedback in the comments below.\n","wordCount":"2291","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-23T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-23T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lorrie Bonds"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/best-pc-controller-2022-the-digital-foundry-buyer-s-guide-to-gamepads/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Best Pc Controller 2022 The Digital Foundry Buyer S Guide To Gamepads</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-23 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 23, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2291 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Lorrie Bonds</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>The most obvious answer is that the best controller is the one you already have.

Compared to the similarly expensive Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, it&rsquo;s hard to pick a favourite. The Elite Series 2 feels more substantial in the hand, with clickier buttons and more conveniently placed triggers, but the Instinct Pro is lighter, with even shorter-throw triggers and a smoother chassis. I think I would normally come down for the Elite Series 2, but that controller&rsquo;s reliability woes would give me some pause - and the Instinct Pro&rsquo;s customisable look makes it a distinct option in its own right.
Pros</p><p>Can be customised for a look and feel entirely your own Instinct Pro variant offers hair triggers and extra grip Works just like the official Xbox Series X/S controller</p><p>Cons</p><p>Extremely expensive once fully customised Face buttons and d-pad aren&rsquo;t quite as good as the best controllers from Microsoft or Razer</p><p>Pros</p><p>Excellent range of customisation options included Good build quality makes the controller a pleasure to use Works just like the official Xbox Series X/S controller</p><p>Cons</p><p>Layout of some less-used buttons is unorthodox Cool transparent body is hidden by the top plates No wireless connectivity</p><p>Pros</p><p>Can connect via 2.4Ghz wireless (PC) or Bluetooth (mobile) Good option for mobile VR gaming</p><p>Cons</p><p>SmartGrip accessory for mounting onto your phone costs $10 Relatively short battery life on Bluetooth</p><p>Pros</p><p>Tactile and responsive d-pad and buttons Convenient iPhone clip is included in the box</p><p>Cons</p><p>Relatively large size means this isn&rsquo;t the most portable option</p><p>Unfortunately, support for wired controllers in native Android games can be hit or miss, with Bluetooth gamepads like the Xbox One controller seemingly being supported in a greater number of games. It&rsquo;s worth researching your favourite titles online before pulling the trigger if it&rsquo;s these native games that are motivating you to consider a gamepad. Still, for the games that support it, the Moga XP5-X offers a big improvement to tactility and control.
As an alternative, consider the Razer Kishi. It offers a different form factor, clipping around your phone to resemble an oversize Nintendo Switch. There are a lot of clever touches here, like a USB-C pass-through port that allows for charging and gaming at the same time, plus a wide frame that accommodates all but the very largest mobiles like the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. However, the spongey buttons aren&rsquo;t up to Razer&rsquo;s usual tip-top standards, costing this option the top slot.
Pros</p><p>Comfortable form factor for mobile gaming Being able to charge your phone while gaming is a nice touch Extremely useful in emulators, cloud gaming and supported Android games</p><p>Cons</p><p>Finding the perfect balance point for your phone Not exactly a pocketable option, although it&rsquo;s portable enough</p><p>PowerA Spectra Enhanced Wired Xbox One Controller: At £30, this gamepad is about £15 cheaper than the official Microsoft Xbox One controller. You lose out on wireless connectivity and a tiny bit of build quality, but you gain edge and button lighting in seven colours, two programmable rear buttons and three-tier trigger locks. The trigger locks didn&rsquo;t work perfectly in our testing, with the most restrictive setting on both triggers resulting in different amounts of movement, but otherwise the controller delivers a reasonable gaming experience and looks good doing it. If the extra features are worthwhile for you and you&rsquo;re not interested in wireless connectivity, then this is a decent choice.
Thrustmaster eSwap Pro: Another solid take on the modular controller concept, this controller only barely misses out on a full place on our round-up. While the clicky buttons and tool-free hot-swappable modules are exceptional, the small rear buttons are harder to use than those of the Astro C40 TR and there&rsquo;s no option for wireless connectivity or hair triggers. Still, given its lower price than the C40 TR, it&rsquo;s worth considering.
Nintendo Switch Pro Controller: This is a good first-party controller with excellent battery life, but it is more expensive than its competitors and doesn&rsquo;t offer any compelling unique features beyond Switch compatibility and a cool see-through design.
Razer Raiju Mobile: While the Raiju Mobile sports clicky buttons, good ergonomics and a built-in smartphone clip, its unusual default bindings on PC require manual remapping in each game. By contrast, the SteelSeries Stratus Duo works well on PC out of the box.
Microsoft Elite Controller (Series 1): The first-gen Elite was a great controller, but the Elite Series 2 offers more features and a better tactile feel at the same price. Only consider this one if you can find it in working order at a good price, or if the lack of a user-replaceable battery in the Series 2 is a deal-breaker for you.
Nacon Pro Controller 3: The design and build quality of this controller is subpar, with flabby shoulder buttons and lethargic sticks, but the real issue is the placement of the extra buttons. Rather than paddles, Nacon has opted for a quartet of small buttons built into the lower grips. This is convenient, in that you can reach these buttons comfortably, but they&rsquo;re all-too-easy to set off accidentally and hard to differentiate. That makes the NPC3 a hard sell in a competitive premium controller market.
Razer Wildcat: Razer&rsquo;s previous-generation Xbox controller is hard to find new, but it can still be a decent choice if you can find it used for a good price. However, the Razer Wolverine offers better ergonomics and a more stylish design.
