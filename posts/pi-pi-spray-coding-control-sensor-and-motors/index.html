That is created by Simon Walters, a Raspberry Pi community member who campaigned for children to learn coding and electronics with Scratch. Scratch was the first foray into the GPIO by Walters in Scratch. Scratch was the first foray into Scratch, based on Scratch 1.4. The old version still exists, but can be used with older versions. In this guide, we will install S3GPIO and learn how to use a high-end electromagnetic sensor as a controller for a DC motor. This is based on our distance with the sensor to a faster speed. We also learn how to create an emergency stop for a motor and incorporate motor control into a code sequence. All of the steps in this tutorial can be used in multiple motors, and we have to fix two more GPIO pins to the L9110S to run the vehicle and control it independently.\nIn order for this project, you will need it. A Raspberry Pi a 3 / 4 400 ml. The latest Raspberry Pi PC. HCSR04.P Ultrason Sensor (Model 4) (PS-V) L9110S Motor Controller. DC Motor For motors, USB cable is available to replace it. Seven x Female wires to female wires Two x Cutlery to braids. Your connection can be reached on a private network.\nThe complete code for this project can be downloaded from our Github repository.\nConnecting the components are necessary. Although the electronic components are relatively simple to connect, the sheer amount of wires might seem confusing to me. Okay, break it down into sections. S3GPIO uses physical pin numbering, not the BCM numbering standard set by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. That means that we have two columns of twenty pins. The two columns start with pin one at the top of the left and pin 2. The left column is the odd column with pins resulting from an odd number pattern: 1,3,5,7,9 etc. The left column is an even column, with numbers progressing 2,4,6,8 etc.\nConnect the h2A SR-32-V to the Raspberry Pi by using male or female jumpers. GND to the pin on Raspberry Pi. Vcc to 3V (Pin 1): Vcc to 3V (Pin 2). Pigger to pin 11! He’s called by Echo to the pin 13.\nConnect the car terminals with the portable cars (depending on what is it that way). Screw them into place so they are snuggly. Connect any GND pin onto the Raspberry Pi. This creates a common ground reference for a project to work. Connect an additional 5V micro USB battery to the CCP of the L9110S motor controller. Connect the – (GND) pin of the power supply with an – (GND) pin on the Raspberry Pi. Connect two female to female jumper wires that connect the A1-A and A1-B terminals of the L9110S to the 8 and 10 pins on the Raspberry Pi. We can use the GPIO to control the L9110S, leaving the motor so bad that it’s actually dead. Added to the Raspberry Pi, we’ve got an externally powered motor, so it can be controlled by S3GPIO. We also need an ultrasonic sensor which is connected and ready for use as a speed controller. The diagram for this project is for you to verify that the connections are correct. Installing S3GPIO Power up your Raspberry Pi and open the terminal. Enter the following command to download the program. Note that the command will download the installer, which generally is very risky for production machines, but it’s safe. wget https://git.io/vMS6T -O isgh8.sh. Install S3GPIO using the command. sudo bash isgh8.sh rhine sah. Restart your Raspberry Pi for the change to happen. Double left click on the S3GPIO icon, and press “End in the terminal” to launch three applications. All the web servers, ScratchGPIO and Chromium and an extension to the existing s3GPIO feature will be launched and it may take a few moments to see S3GPIO. Click on the map to view inside to enter the online report editor. You’re creating the project. It has the same interface as Scratch 3, but is still an S3GPIO block in My Blocks that we will use.\nOpen the events section. This is the start of our code and will test the HCSR04-P ultrasonic sensor. From My Blocks drag the S3GPIO command to connect the previous block. In the white box type ultra11,13 These are the pins of the trigger and the echo on the sensor. Drag a forever loop from Control and connect to the previous blocks. Click the drag S3GPIO to place them in the forever loop. In the White Box, type ultra13, it will read the echopin of the ultrasonic sensor, and in the background it will be converted to a measurement in centimeters. From Looks, dragging a Say Hello! block and place it under the previous. From Variables, drag the sensor over the Hello! This will say the ultrasonic sensor distance reading. From My Blocks, drag S3GPIO set to _ by’and place it under the previous block. In the first blank, type Power8, and in the second, another sensor block is made up of Variables. This will turn the motor pin connected to the electric pin 8 onto the value returns by the sensor. From Control. Drag a waiter’s block. Add it to the previous block, and edit a waiter’s block to wait for a few minutes. Your code should look great now. Let’s take the code. The motor must grow. Now move your hand closer to the two eyes of the sensor, the drive speed will slow. Click on the stop button at the right on the ground, but it will not stop! We need to get behind the wheel. Please add the brakes to the code. In a new section of code, place an When Space Key is Pressed Block in Events. From My Blocks drag two S3GPIO sets _ and _ blocks to the previous. In order to save the first S3GPIO, set to Power8, and set to Power10, set to 0 in the first S3GPIO, set to 0. From the control, drag The rest of the whole unit and place it under the previous block. Your code should look good now. Take the Green Flag and test your hand-tracking device. The motor needs to go quickly, as you can imagine the speed. When you’re ready press the button, to get the speed off the motor. Adding more to the code: Create an equator. By using the sensor, we can do an intelligent shunt. This sequence will spin the motor in one direction, then reverse before turning the motors over again. The sequence will iterate (loop) 10 times before it ends and it awaits the user to start the sequence again.\nFrom Events, drag What space key pressed and a new sequence of code became available. Change the space key from an r in the drop-down. From Control, drag repeat 10 and place this under the previous block. From My Blocks, drag two command blocks and place them in the loop. Turn the second down on the 8-on and the 10-off-on-one. From Control, drag and place Wait a second and take it to the nearest point in the loop. Left click on the top of the S3GPIO block and then enter to duplicate. It’ll replace the three blocks we’ve just created. Under the previous, place those new blocks in a loop. In these blocks change the number 8 and the number 10 to the number 11. Repeat the double-block, and place the newly duplicated three under them, still inside the loop. Set the S3GPIO command so that both of them are off. This project has already appeared in the Linux Magazine issue.
