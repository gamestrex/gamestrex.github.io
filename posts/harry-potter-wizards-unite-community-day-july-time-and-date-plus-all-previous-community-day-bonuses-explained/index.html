On this page: Date: Saturday, 11th July 2020 Time: 12:01am to 11:59pm (your local time) Bonus 1: Chance of encountering foundables for Knockturn Alley increased, including Hag. Ministry Executioner, Portrait of Bellatrix Lestrange, Thestral and Swooping Evil Bonus 2: Tonic for Trace Detection bonus increased Bonus 3: Tonic for Trace Detection brewing time reduced to an hour Bonus 4: Master Note effectiveness for Tonic for Trace Detection increased by 50% Bonus 5: Special 1km Portkey Portmantaus that can include a Knockturn Alley Sign Throughout each Community Day you can also complete a variety of Special Assignments, which will reward you with a Runestone, Spellbooks and other items. You can easily collect Spell Energy by visiting the many inns dotted across the map, but potion brewing is a little more complex. First, you’ll want to ensure that you’ve gathered enough ingredients, so don’t forget to visit the nearest Greenhouse. Once you’re ready to start potion brewing, make sure you use the Master Notes for your potion to decrease it’s brewing time. We recommend brewing both Barrufio’s Brain Elixir and any form of Exstimulo Potion. If you’re planning on partaking in a couple of Wizarding Challenges, then it would also be a good idea to make a couple of Healing Potions. Barrufio’s Brain Elixir provides you with double XP for 30 minutes, which, depending on the Community Day bonuses, can be extended. Meanwhile, all Exstimulo Potions will improve your spell casts for at least three turns. Both of these effects can help you increase the productivity and success of your Community Day. It’s also a good idea to complete any outstanding Portkey Portmantaus that you might have, as some Community Days will allow you to collect special Portkey Portmantauses. These portkeys will have a shorter walking distance than the ones you typically find throughout the map and may also contain rare Foundable fragments for your Registry. Finally, Community Days are the perfect time to use any spare Dark Detectors you might have. Each Community Day tends to be focused around one specific Registry page, increasing the chance of you encountering a number of rare Foundables from this page. Deploying a Dark Detector will increase your chances of finding one of these rare Foundables. If you don’t have any spare Dark Detectors, then you can easily purchase more from the in-game store using Gold, which can be earned by completing SOS, Daily and Special Assignments. Before beginning your wizarding adventure, you’ll want to join a Hogwarts House in Harry Potter Wizards Unite. After that you’ll need to learn how to battle, so you can compete in Wizarding Challenges at Fortresses or how to use Greenhouses, so that you can perform Potion Master Notes. You can also unlock Portkey Portmanteaus and choose a profession from Auror, Magizoologist or Professor.
