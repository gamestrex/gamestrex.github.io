If you don’t count on this, it was a terrible year. A clear view of what was, for example, very dangerous, and especially sad news, only if you do not like to go to bed, hide under the covers, and waste any money if you don’t pass this word. Instead of hiding, we look back at 2021, imagining just how awful it really was, examining the greatest disappointments, worst habits and seemingly all the worse news. If you wanna crash and sleep until New Years Eve, no one will blame you. And now let’s turn and take our analytical, steely eyes back into the year — the past year is the most exciting. That was really something else.\nBobby Kotick still has a job. Activision Blizzards cruel treatment of women, seemingly endemic problems with sexual harassment and generally toxic workplaces are the most tragic of 2021. Several lawsuits began, several investigations began, and a procession of executives leaving, apologizing or any other matter. And through all the trouble, a longtime CEO, Bobby Kotick, remained. Even though it became clear that Kotick was an active participant of the toxic bullshit in the Call of Duty mega-publisher, many leaders of the industry, while staff remained silent, despite the fact that he wasn’t a leader, many people’s comments about his leadership, and that he was able to return, however, as a tin deer became stuck in a hard-to-reach spot. If you know how the world works, that drained, unfathomably well-compensated executive is likely to keep on working next year.\nBattlefield 2042 botches its launch. I believe that Battlefield games are always in rough condition historically. In that case, it isn’t a good excuse. At that time, folks didn’t seem very interested in paying for beta test for first time of the world to be the biggest online shooter. BF2042 suffered the wrong opening, losing many players in the process, and now continues to struggle with finding its place while competing for the new online shooter Fortnite and the new Halo Infinite will prosper and grow. It seems that even a brand of so great mighty Battlefield isn’t too big to fail.\nGTA Trilogy is a witty meme disaster. On paper, the new system of classic Grand Theft Auto games from PS2 is a really good idea. They haven’t changed very well and can benefit from improved controls, improved visuals and some reshapes. Unfortunately, the long-researched GTA The Trilogy: Definitive Edition that was posted in November 2012 was a terrible mess. Sometimes it seemed attractive but most of it was filled with broken features, bugs, bad-looking rain and newly ugly characters. As for a rare apology from Rockstar, the collection is better placed thanks to several small changes that have started to repair the shitton of problems. It can’t be this fiasco, but it’s still far from where people need to name it definitive.\nNo 4K Switch Pro. Sure, we’ve got a new Nintendo Switch model this year. A beautiful orange tyre looks lovely with an impressive, larger screen, and a few other appreciated improvements. But what many people wanted was a stronger Switch, and I also saw a larger switch. Playing Switch games on a 4K television is stupid because upscaling technologies are better than ever, but it also ain’t a miracle worker. It’s said that many of these Switch ports are very little and clunky today than their counterparts on other platforms — often with higher, more stable framerates and better-quality visuals. Even though many reports and rumors claim a switch-pro is coming, its existence hasn’t yet proved anything but a rumor.\nNFTs were born immediately affecting gaming. 2021 continued to give the idea that the future could sink. With no cool flying cars or a wonderful spaceship, the future is filled with celebs and tech bros destroying the planet through apex and buying links to crappy cartoon apes. I truly wish this sentence didn’t make any sense. But unfortunately, it’s the future, for which we live now. Assholes are digging up graves and using dead people like Bob Ross to get their fake tokens stolen. Even videogame makers and devs are spreading the awful trend of sarcastic travel, with Ubisoft releasing helmets and guns for Ghost Recon Breakpoint that are tied into an NFT ecosystem. Thankfully, no one else seems to care about those. With plans like Will Wright and Peter Molyneux running to stop the NFT bubble, its certainly a sad surprise that all these blockchain bullshits are going to pop up on your timeline in 2022.\nTake-Two shuts the GTA fan projects down. While the Rockstar and parent company Take-Two Interactive released the disappointing GTA Trilogy remaster, they scoundered up the competition by takingdowns to tons of classic Grand Theft Auto mods. The internet is an important source of work that is made up of passionate and talented modders. And even after the remasters release, take-Two continued to target GTA mods. It became hotter with the idea that it was “likes” a co-op game. Take-Two was to be a big corporate dick in 2021.\nHalo Infinite is veryspartan from the start. Halo Infinite is a very good game, but it could’ve been even better. The newest entry in Microsofts sci-fi franchise opened in December with only a handful of multiplayer maps, modes, no Forge, no Firefight, and perhaps saddest of all, no way to play a co-op campaign with friends, on the hoop of an evolving naive side. Oh, the battle pass sucks. Even though all of this is coming to an end and many other events are coming, launching without was a major disappointment.\nChris Pratt put Mario in his picture. If youre forced to try to come back to the movies, why wouldn’t you just decide to play Mario and Chris Pratt, would you like to play Mario? Let’s ignore the dudes history for a minute and focus on the fact that Mario has already a famous and talented voice actor, Charles Martinet, who was probably in a movie great. Instead, Chris Pratt is voicing the iconic plumber for reasons I don’t fully understand and care about. At least Garfield is safe, right? Oh\nThe Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack is expensive, a joke! How much money are you willing to spend for terrible education, a library of games, etc? It sounded a little bit weak. Since it sounds like you can’t pay for that. Nevertheless, Nintendo decided thats exactly what people wanted when it launched its Xbox One Expansion Pack earlier this year. For $50 per year, you have access to a very small library of N64 and Sega Genesis, an Animal Crossing expansion, that is capable of purchasing separately, and, yes, it! And to put it another example, the quality of emulation isn’t impressive, especially compared to fan-made offerings. This package was a bad deal.\nThe glimmer! with nightmare of 2021. I never knew who would soon have had a bad time. Despite the fact that the people who watched the show at Sony weren’t able to ignore that, I didn’t ever think I was happy. A myth to some of my guest judges, the sort of person who’s doing that all hires, and despite the great number of people who are taking the job, the firings, etc., the failure of a notorious trainwreck that makes me so disappointed that we lost someone as cool and sweet as Alex Trebek.\nThe Game Awards 2021 make up for controversy. 2021 has been a long year. We have seen a lot of talk about unionisation, with the game devs share over a hundred percent shame and destruction. Add in the ongoing shitstorm around Activision Blizzard and you’ve made a great moment in game history. It may be a perfect time to use one of the biggest stages of the year to speak seriously about these issues, elevating voices that need to be heard and helping people live better, safer lives. The Game Awards opened in a terribly toothless speech by Geoff Keighley, the Dorito-lord of exclusives. The adverts seemed to be of no use to the viewers like Riot Games, Quantic Dream and Ubisoft. It ran into nowhere and then slashed all that and popped into front of viewers. It wasn’t surprising, but disappointing. Speaking of a word which I am going to talk about is very important.\nQuantic Dreams makes that Star Wars game ready for use. After that hollow commentary by Kima superfan Keighley, viewers were treated to a trailer for a cool-looking Star Wars game designed by, oops, Quantic Dream, a French studio that is apparently a horrible, toxic place to work at, with claims of homophobia, racist jokes, and sexual harassment. And dont forget some brutal crunch too. Although the studio behind Detroit recently won a libel case over its terrible workplace, the lawsuit didn’t really disprove any of the claims made against the studio. Even though it didn’t come to The Game Awards, in 2021, as a result of a dull opening announcement, the choice to include became very unpopular and frank as he would do with the production.\nThe colognes still have a thing. When you live on this planet and watch or read any news, you know that covid-19 continues to cause all sorts of problems around the world. With new variants spreading as many countries relax their safety protocols, it seems likely 2022 will be another year full of covid-related pain and deaths. Of course, despite its high death toll, the pandemic continues to exacerbate the problem facing an already already strained global supply chain. This adversely affected console manufacturing and game production, leading to hardware shortages and multiple production delays all year long.\nTriple-A PC ports are fixed Fs. The days of bad computer games were mostly over but this year saw terrible port jobs. Our own Luke Plunkett called Ninja Gaiden one of the worst PC ports he played. It’s been patched and improved, but most recently another big-name game hit PC in a terrible state. The Windows version of Final Fantasy VII Remake is a performance fiasco with numerous players reporting all sorts of issues while trying to play the Square Enix mega-arrival. Hopefully the publisher will fix it soon, but why did it think releasing it in such a state was just fine to begin with?\nRiver, the fourth worst of Fallout 4, died. In June, 2021 seemed to have a bad turn on the German shepherd Fallout 4 – whose name was River – was found dead. Why should you not look out for Fallout 4 and its many flaws? As for Dogmeat, no matter how many times you accidentally shot him, it always seemed better to watch you. According to Rivers owner, former Bethesda dev Joel Burgess, real life dog sounds like a real-life dog that is also loyal, loving, and sweet. I’m crying again. Great, River. You were a good dog.\nLive-action Cowboy Bebop didn’t deliver. While the live-action adaptation of Cowboy Bebop could have made a passable sitcom or theatrical melodrama of a sci-fi cinematic play, its interpretation of the material that came out of the original post was impossible. The cost of being a ‘live-action’ film was a lot of an uphill battle, given the fact that any live-action adaptation loses an instant 50 percent of the sales of its source material. However, in spite of Netflix’s credit, it made it an effort to create something new, ostensibly giving its show reason more to be like such a well-known moment. Sadly, its various missteps included bloated episodes, the Marvelization of Faye Valentine, the cringe-inducing dialogue, whatever the hell Vicious was doing, and a bold commitment to try to recreate Edwards extortional mannerisms IRL. I know the live action Cowboy Bebop was anything but easy come, easy go, but it left many people with a strong desire to learn the iconic anime instead. Isaiah Colbert\nThe Balan Wonderworld is no different than everyone has ever imagined. Is there any new game from the creators of the classics Sonic the Hedgehog and NiGHTS Into Dreams? It’s bright, colourful, and whimsical! It’s boring, poorly executed, and nonsensical. The whole bunch of cool ideas are broken together in a way that makes them all a shameless. Balan Wonderworld seemed really amazing in its early trailers. The games demo went out and everyone hated it, except me. I tried to convince him that the demos disconnected experience would be more better in the full game, but still it wasn’t. Yuji Naka quit Square Enix just shortly after the release of Balan Wonderworld. He recently released a mobile game in his own hands via Twitter. It isn’t great, but it’s better than Balan Wonderworld. Mike Fahey\nE3 2021 can’t be seen in the face of the world. I was given the chance to see that in 2017, E3, the biggest video game event of the year, returned in 2021 after only a year due to covid-19. Well, to return is probably a bit of an overstatement, because everything was made by no means in-person, however. The European Convention Council became a perfect example of the lost importance of the conventions, with many studios choosing to participate in separate, E3-adjacent live streams rather than take part under the official umbrella. With the numerous obstacles to game dev presented by the ongoing pandemic, the show turned into a buffet of games you might play someday. Let’s be true: Do we seriously need everyone in the gaming industry to hold all their best commercials every year until they begin playing in the summer? No. Hype will be the year of 2015. Ian Walker\nConsoles remain difficult AFto find. While some of us at Kotaku, particularly smooth Newtaku operator Jeremy Winslow, managed both a PlayStation 5 and a Xbox Series S, many people still still wait for their chance to get a next-gen console. The pandemic and related semiconductor shortage still made 2021 a pain for hopeful console buyers. And I believe that as soon as you happen to know, Sony will produce an unlimited number of less expensive PlayStation 5s in 2022 – and Microsofts Phil Spencer admits that the cost of the Xbox console hasn’t extended beyond next year. Congratulations. Jeremy Winslow\nIn 2021, the player had their rights to play a game. The number of games that was killed in this year was quite large. Even though they were perhaps the best one, the only exception was that they went missing and Titanfall was ruined. As it was estimated, many games were put under six feet for the following year. There are no new rights to play for those you heard of, but for many other obscure games. That’s a huge blow. Only these efforts will become vital if it are to use this free and temporary support patterns to keep up with that (very young, really) industry. Jeremy Winslow\nRoblox is a huge mess, awful mess. Roblox isn’t a game but a platform where players make and play games with blocky avatars that are just off-brand enough to prevent Lego going into action. And 2021 was the year that the company responsible for this game was finally released for over 45 billion dollars. Unfortunately, it was also the year when Roblox was discovered to be constantly putting profits over those who love it, who have a ton of children. The game has a lot of potential to recruit fascists, is fighting to temper sexual roleplay, and is built on an invisible labor model and that players build value on the players with promises of big payouts that rarely materialize. There’s even a gambling game. Most sad? Some companies are trying to copy it. Ethan Gach If you want to read all that, you can also enjoy The Best Videogame Surprise of 2021. I promise that the article is cheerier. It’s shorter, but life is also what we call the future: life.\n","wordCount":"2662","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-06T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-06T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Florence Gunter"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/the-greatest-gambling-disappointments-of-2021-the-biggest-disappointments-of-2021/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>The Greatest Gambling Disappointments Of 2021 The Biggest Disappointments Of 2021</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-06 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 6, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2662 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Florence Gunter</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#bobby-kotick-still-has-a-job>Bobby Kotick still has a job.</a></li><li><a href=#battlefield-2042-botches-its-launch>Battlefield 2042 botches its launch.</a></li><li><a href=#gta-trilogy-is-a-witty-meme-disaster>GTA Trilogy is a witty meme disaster.</a></li><li><a href=#no-4k-switch-pro>No 4K Switch Pro.</a></li><li><a href=#nfts-were-born-immediately-affecting-gaming>NFTs were born immediately affecting gaming.</a></li><li><a href=#take-two-shuts-the-gta-fan-projects-down>Take-Two shuts the GTA fan projects down.</a></li><li><a href=#halo-infinite-is-veryspartan-from-the-start>Halo Infinite is veryspartan from the start.</a></li><li><a href=#chris-pratt-put-mario-in-his-picture>Chris Pratt put Mario in his picture.</a></li><li><a href=#the-nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-is-expensive-a-joke>The Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack is expensive, a joke!</a></li><li><a href=#the-glimmer-with-nightmare-of-2021>The glimmer!

It seems that even a brand of so great mighty Battlefield isn’t too big to fail.</p><h2 id=gta-trilogy-is-a-witty-meme-disaster>GTA Trilogy is a witty meme disaster.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gta-trilogy-is-a-witty-meme-disaster>#</a></h2><p>On paper, the new system of classic Grand Theft Auto games from PS2 is a really good idea. They haven’t changed very well and can benefit from improved controls, improved visuals and some reshapes. Unfortunately, the long-researched GTA The Trilogy: Definitive Edition that was posted in November 2012 was a terrible mess. Sometimes it seemed attractive but most of it was filled with broken features, bugs, bad-looking rain and newly ugly characters. As for a rare apology from Rockstar, the collection is better placed thanks to several small changes that have started to repair the shitton of problems. It can’t be this fiasco, but it’s still far from where people need to name it definitive.</p><h2 id=no-4k-switch-pro>No 4K Switch Pro.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#no-4k-switch-pro>#</a></h2><p>Sure, we’ve got a new Nintendo Switch model this year. A beautiful orange tyre looks lovely with an impressive, larger screen, and a few other appreciated improvements. But what many people wanted was a stronger Switch, and I also saw a larger switch. Playing Switch games on a 4K television is stupid because upscaling technologies are better than ever, but it also ain’t a miracle worker. It’s said that many of these Switch ports are very little and clunky today than their counterparts on other platforms — often with higher, more stable framerates and better-quality visuals. Even though many reports and rumors claim a switch-pro is coming, its existence hasn’t yet proved anything but a rumor.</p><h2 id=nfts-were-born-immediately-affecting-gaming>NFTs were born immediately affecting gaming.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#nfts-were-born-immediately-affecting-gaming>#</a></h2><p>2021 continued to give the idea that the future could sink. With no cool flying cars or a wonderful spaceship, the future is filled with celebs and tech bros destroying the planet through apex and buying links to crappy cartoon apes. I truly wish this sentence didn’t make any sense. But unfortunately, it’s the future, for which we live now. Assholes are digging up graves and using dead people like Bob Ross to get their fake tokens stolen. Even videogame makers and devs are spreading the awful trend of sarcastic travel, with Ubisoft releasing helmets and guns for Ghost Recon Breakpoint that are tied into an NFT ecosystem. Thankfully, no one else seems to care about those. With plans like Will Wright and Peter Molyneux running to stop the NFT bubble, its certainly a sad surprise that all these blockchain bullshits are going to pop up on your timeline in 2022.</p><h2 id=take-two-shuts-the-gta-fan-projects-down>Take-Two shuts the GTA fan projects down.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#take-two-shuts-the-gta-fan-projects-down>#</a></h2><p>While the Rockstar and parent company Take-Two Interactive released the disappointing GTA Trilogy remaster, they scoundered up the competition by takingdowns to tons of classic Grand Theft Auto mods. The internet is an important source of work that is made up of passionate and talented modders. And even after the remasters release, take-Two continued to target GTA mods. It became hotter with the idea that it was “likes” a co-op game. Take-Two was to be a big corporate dick in 2021.</p><h2 id=halo-infinite-is-veryspartan-from-the-start>Halo Infinite is veryspartan from the start.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#halo-infinite-is-veryspartan-from-the-start>#</a></h2><p>Halo Infinite is a very good game, but it could’ve been even better. The newest entry in Microsofts sci-fi franchise opened in December with only a handful of multiplayer maps, modes, no Forge, no Firefight, and perhaps saddest of all, no way to play a co-op campaign with friends, on the hoop of an evolving naive side. Oh, the battle pass sucks. Even though all of this is coming to an end and many other events are coming, launching without was a major disappointment.</p><h2 id=chris-pratt-put-mario-in-his-picture>Chris Pratt put Mario in his picture.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chris-pratt-put-mario-in-his-picture>#</a></h2><p>If youre forced to try to come back to the movies, why wouldn’t you just decide to play Mario and Chris Pratt, would you like to play Mario? Let’s ignore the dudes history for a minute and focus on the fact that Mario has already a famous and talented voice actor, Charles Martinet, who was probably in a movie great. Instead, Chris Pratt is voicing the iconic plumber for reasons I don’t fully understand and care about. At least Garfield is safe, right? Oh</p><h2 id=the-nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-is-expensive-a-joke>The Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack is expensive, a joke!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-is-expensive-a-joke>#</a></h2><p>How much money are you willing to spend for terrible education, a library of games, etc? It sounded a little bit weak. Since it sounds like you can’t pay for that. Nevertheless, Nintendo decided thats exactly what people wanted when it launched its Xbox One Expansion Pack earlier this year. For $50 per year, you have access to a very small library of N64 and Sega Genesis, an Animal Crossing expansion, that is capable of purchasing separately, and, yes, it! And to put it another example, the quality of emulation isn’t impressive, especially compared to fan-made offerings. This package was a bad deal.</p><h2 id=the-glimmer-with-nightmare-of-2021>The glimmer! with nightmare of 2021.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-glimmer-with-nightmare-of-2021>#</a></h2><p>I never knew who would soon have had a bad time. Despite the fact that the people who watched the show at Sony weren’t able to ignore that, I didn’t ever think I was happy. A myth to some of my guest judges, the sort of person who’s doing that all hires, and despite the great number of people who are taking the job, the firings, etc., the failure of a notorious trainwreck that makes me so disappointed that we lost someone as cool and sweet as Alex Trebek.</p><h2 id=the-game-awards-2021-make-up-for-controversy>The Game Awards 2021 make up for controversy.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-game-awards-2021-make-up-for-controversy>#</a></h2><p>2021 has been a long year. We have seen a lot of talk about unionisation, with the game devs share over a hundred percent shame and destruction. Add in the ongoing shitstorm around Activision Blizzard and you’ve made a great moment in game history. It may be a perfect time to use one of the biggest stages of the year to speak seriously about these issues, elevating voices that need to be heard and helping people live better, safer lives.
The Game Awards opened in a terribly toothless speech by Geoff Keighley, the Dorito-lord of exclusives. The adverts seemed to be of no use to the viewers like Riot Games, Quantic Dream and Ubisoft. It ran into nowhere and then slashed all that and popped into front of viewers. It wasn’t surprising, but disappointing. Speaking of a word which I am going to talk about is very important.</p><h2 id=quantic-dreams-makes-that-star-wars-game-ready-for-use>Quantic Dreams makes that Star Wars game ready for use.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#quantic-dreams-makes-that-star-wars-game-ready-for-use>#</a></h2><p>After that hollow commentary by Kima superfan Keighley, viewers were treated to a trailer for a cool-looking Star Wars game designed by, oops, Quantic Dream, a French studio that is apparently a horrible, toxic place to work at, with claims of homophobia, racist jokes, and sexual harassment. And dont forget some brutal crunch too. Although the studio behind Detroit recently won a libel case over its terrible workplace, the lawsuit didn’t really disprove any of the claims made against the studio. Even though it didn’t come to The Game Awards, in 2021, as a result of a dull opening announcement, the choice to include became very unpopular and frank as he would do with the production.</p><h2 id=the-colognes-still-have-a-thing>The colognes still have a thing.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-colognes-still-have-a-thing>#</a></h2><p>When you live on this planet and watch or read any news, you know that covid-19 continues to cause all sorts of problems around the world. With new variants spreading as many countries relax their safety protocols, it seems likely 2022 will be another year full of covid-related pain and deaths. Of course, despite its high death toll, the pandemic continues to exacerbate the problem facing an already already strained global supply chain. This adversely affected console manufacturing and game production, leading to hardware shortages and multiple production delays all year long.</p><h2 id=triple-a-pc-ports-are-fixed-fs>Triple-A PC ports are fixed Fs.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#triple-a-pc-ports-are-fixed-fs>#</a></h2><p>The days of bad computer games were mostly over but this year saw terrible port jobs. Our own Luke Plunkett called Ninja Gaiden one of the worst PC ports he played. It’s been patched and improved, but most recently another big-name game hit PC in a terrible state. The Windows version of Final Fantasy VII Remake is a performance fiasco with numerous players reporting all sorts of issues while trying to play the Square Enix mega-arrival. Hopefully the publisher will fix it soon, but why did it think releasing it in such a state was just fine to begin with?</p><h2 id=river-the-fourth-worst-of-fallout-4-died>River, the fourth worst of Fallout 4, died.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#river-the-fourth-worst-of-fallout-4-died>#</a></h2><p>In June, 2021 seemed to have a bad turn on the German shepherd Fallout 4 – whose name was River – was found dead. Why should you not look out for Fallout 4 and its many flaws? As for Dogmeat, no matter how many times you accidentally shot him, it always seemed better to watch you. According to Rivers owner, former Bethesda dev Joel Burgess, real life dog sounds like a real-life dog that is also loyal, loving, and sweet. I’m crying again. Great, River. You were a good dog.</p><h2 id=live-action-cowboy-bebop-didnt-deliver>Live-action Cowboy Bebop didn’t deliver.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#live-action-cowboy-bebop-didnt-deliver>#</a></h2><p>While the live-action adaptation of Cowboy Bebop could have made a passable sitcom or theatrical melodrama of a sci-fi cinematic play, its interpretation of the material that came out of the original post was impossible. The cost of being a ‘live-action’ film was a lot of an uphill battle, given the fact that any live-action adaptation loses an instant 50 percent of the sales of its source material. However, in spite of Netflix’s credit, it made it an effort to create something new, ostensibly giving its show reason more to be like such a well-known moment.
Sadly, its various missteps included bloated episodes, the Marvelization of Faye Valentine, the cringe-inducing dialogue, whatever the hell Vicious was doing, and a bold commitment to try to recreate Edwards extortional mannerisms IRL. I know the live action Cowboy Bebop was anything but easy come, easy go, but it left many people with a strong desire to learn the iconic anime instead.

It’s bright, colourful, and whimsical! It’s boring, poorly executed, and nonsensical. The whole bunch of cool ideas are broken together in a way that makes them all a shameless. Balan Wonderworld seemed really amazing in its early trailers. The games demo went out and everyone hated it, except me. I tried to convince him that the demos disconnected experience would be more better in the full game, but still it wasn’t. Yuji Naka quit Square Enix just shortly after the release of Balan Wonderworld. He recently released a mobile game in his own hands via Twitter. It isn’t great, but it’s better than Balan Wonderworld. Mike Fahey</p><h2 id=e3-2021-cant-be-seen-in-the-face-of-the-world>E3 2021 can’t be seen in the face of the world.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#e3-2021-cant-be-seen-in-the-face-of-the-world>#</a></h2><p>I was given the chance to see that in 2017, E3, the biggest video game event of the year, returned in 2021 after only a year due to covid-19. Well, to return is probably a bit of an overstatement, because everything was made by no means in-person, however. The European Convention Council became a perfect example of the lost importance of the conventions, with many studios choosing to participate in separate, E3-adjacent live streams rather than take part under the official umbrella.
With the numerous obstacles to game dev presented by the ongoing pandemic, the show turned into a buffet of games you might play someday. Let’s be true: Do we seriously need everyone in the gaming industry to hold all their best commercials every year until they begin playing in the summer? No. Hype will be the year of 2015. Ian Walker</p><h2 id=consoles-remain-difficult-afto-find>Consoles remain difficult AFto find.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#consoles-remain-difficult-afto-find>#</a></h2><p>While some of us at Kotaku, particularly smooth Newtaku operator Jeremy Winslow, managed both a PlayStation 5 and a Xbox Series S, many people still still wait for their chance to get a next-gen console. The pandemic and related semiconductor shortage still made 2021 a pain for hopeful console buyers. And I believe that as soon as you happen to know, Sony will produce an unlimited number of less expensive PlayStation 5s in 2022 – and Microsofts Phil Spencer admits that the cost of the Xbox console hasn’t extended beyond next year. Congratulations. Jeremy Winslow</p><h2 id=in-2021-the-player-had-their-rights-to-play-a-game>In 2021, the player had their rights to play a game.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#in-2021-the-player-had-their-rights-to-play-a-game>#</a></h2><p>The number of games that was killed in this year was quite large. Even though they were perhaps the best one, the only exception was that they went missing and Titanfall was ruined. As it was estimated, many games were put under six feet for the following year. There are no new rights to play for those you heard of, but for many other obscure games. That’s a huge blow. Only these efforts will become vital if it are to use this free and temporary support patterns to keep up with that (very young, really) industry. Jeremy Winslow</p><h2 id=roblox-is-a-huge-mess-awful-mess>Roblox is a huge mess, awful mess.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#roblox-is-a-huge-mess-awful-mess>#</a></h2><p>Roblox isn’t a game but a platform where players make and play games with blocky avatars that are just off-brand enough to prevent Lego going into action. And 2021 was the year that the company responsible for this game was finally released for over 45 billion dollars. Unfortunately, it was also the year when Roblox was discovered to be constantly putting profits over those who love it, who have a ton of children. The game has a lot of potential to recruit fascists, is fighting to temper sexual roleplay, and is built on an invisible labor model and that players build value on the players with promises of big payouts that rarely materialize. There’s even a gambling game. Most sad? Some companies are trying to copy it. Ethan Gach
