In fact, player knocks can often be used to distract opponents and lure them in with a false sense of safety. If a player does get knocked down, they should make their way to safety. When the opponent pursues to eliminate them, the rest of the team can easily take them out. Do not rush into this and give away the location as the opponent could have their own squad to back them up as well. Try to crouch and uncrouch during a gunfight to make it harder for opponents to pin you down for a good shot. Drop shots can also be a good technique if you are trying not to give your location away in a close encounter. However, do not be predictable with your gameplay. Too much of similar kinds of shots will eventually make you an easy target.\nBe Aggressive Playing it safe might seem like a good option but being aggressive is what will help players improve their PUBG gameplay to pro levels. Once you start actively seeking out enemies, you will develop a more aggressive strategy in the game that focuses more on your skills than stealth. To succeed with the aggressive approach players will need to be fairly accurate with their shots. While this approach will mess up your ranking, it will also push you towards improving your combat skills. Even if you take the defensive approaching future games, you will be ready to take out enemies if you are ambushed. So, play aggressive games and improve your skills. This doesnâ€™t need to be your permanent strategy but it will help you improve and become a pro at BGMI faster.\nStay On The Move Instead of staying put while applying a medikit, keep on the move and plan ahead. Especially if the opponent that shot you has not been eliminated, it is a good idea to keep moving. Find a safe spot like a house or shelter in case you need to get your bearings for a second. Also, trying to seek higher ground is always a good move in this game as it will give you an advantage over the opponents.\nDeal Damage While it is best to eliminate the opponent if possible, sometimes just doing enough damage can also do the trick. The opponent might slip out of your sight after receiving a shot or two and not be eliminated. You may think that this was a wasted opportunity but that is not entirely true. By dealing damage to the opponent, you have bought yourself valuable time where you can either pursue the enemy to eliminate them or progress through the game uninterrupted as the opponent will be busy trying to nurse back their health. However, this is only true when the damage done is high enough. With low damage, the opponent might still try to retaliate.\nUse Smoke Grenades Smoke Grenades can turn the tide of the game in Battlegrounds Mobile India. It can be used as a cover to blindside your opponent as well as a distraction. It is especially helpful if you have a player knocked out in your team and need a diversion to get them to safety. So, carry Smoke Grenades and elevate your BGMI gameplay to pro in no time.\nWork On Your Skills Aiming skills will take you a long way in this game. Work on your aiming skills to take down opponents with fewer and more precise shots. Moreover, prioritize skill over cosmetics in the game. Often, players will go for weapons they have skins for. While there is nothing wrong with that, it can be quite disastrous if you choose a less powerful gun just because of its skin. Prioritize better weapons rather than better-looking weapons for the gameplay and you will be a pro BGMI player soon enough.\nRushing In After Knocking Down An Enemy You might be tempted to rush in and finish an enemy that you have just knocked down. However, this is not the best move in many situations and might end up getting you killed. While you have knocked down one player, its teammates might still be waiting to try and ambush you. If you walk headfirst towards the location of the knocked-out opponent, you might be walking straight into a trap. Try to use frag grenades or molotovs to finish off the opponent instead.\nPlay on the best device This is one of the most basic issues due to which many players are not performing to their best potential. Low-end devices can cause the game performance to suffer due to lags and crashes. These can eliminate even the best of players with a lot of skill. To ensure that this does not happen with you, ensure that you have a good device with high RAM and a compatible processor. In addition, get good-quality headphones to enhance your BGMI experience. Sound players a vital part of the game, so if you want to be a BGMI pro you need to have a good sound system in place.\nPlay on stable ping Often you can be on a great streak in a match and the game will lag or crash. Sound familiar? Unfortunately, it is a familiar experience for a lot of BGMI players. To avoid this, you must make sure that you are playing with a low ping rate. Here are a few tips and tricks to Fix High Ping Issues.\nThese are all the tips and tricks that can make you jump from a noob to a pro BGMI player. We hope this article was helpful to you.
