Despite the success and success of the gaming industry in its portrayal of Black characters, protagonists or otherwise, and the fact that it is a hugely influential individual is still struggling with the concept. As with most Black gamers, people who have long had to deal with the misdisrepresentation of our skin, hair and essence for decades, have all agreed to be there, Lord. After that I played Deathloop, the actual game I had understood the assignment and made me say, “Man, to hell!” This game shows that video games can provide us with amazing Black characters. But the continued failure to do so is simply a choice. The game needs more real black characters. We need them now. After feeling some way, I was invited to Jason Kelley, the voice of Deathloops amazing protagonist Colt Vahn, to talk about the wrong ways in which many developers can create black characters, and how, in Deathloops leads, Arkane gave us Black characters real. Even before starting to get into a little darkness, we must define what makes a real black character. Many black characters in games are black-passing. Think Barret of Final Fantasy VII, or Nessa from Pokemon Sword and Shield. People who have the right to be Black are probably a ghost-filled Halloween costume that they want to be Black but with infidelity. Many studios create those people, and their characterization is only skin-deep. As per the original Fantasy VII, Barret is a loud and utterly abrasive, excessively violent, unintelligent brute. In laymen’s terms, he’s there to be angry Black men, but rarely. In contrast, a real black character’s depth is due to their skin color and their complexity as an individual. Mylanin marriages love, hate, mysticism, mystery and majesty. A Colt and Juliana could easily be in every game released, not just one that happens once a decade. Jason Kelley shared his thoughts about the fundamental failures of game creators who often approach to creating black characters. One major factor is that sometimes Blackness isn’t even part of how these characters are conceived from the beginning. They want a character, and that character is almost flavorless. I don’t think I was hungry, Kelley said. If they cast their main leads, they go, Oh, well, we should add some diversity. Let’s make this character black. That’s it. There is no backstory to who they are. We don’t know how this person came across today; these characters come off as very two-dimensional. They don’t have flavor, and its not negativity. This was not just because the casting was a mistake. From the beginning, the richness of our culture is injected into the characters’ DNA. Despite having given us Black avatars over the past two decades, games have only offered a small handful that has just been kind of believable black people. Don’t you believe me? Take a quick trip to Google to find the names for every game that you’ll see on their lists of Great Black Characters. The Walking Dead (Earth Everett) and Marcus Holloway’s 2 Watch Dogs are obvious side-by-sides, the only one that happens occasionally, the Grand Theft Auto All-Stars are easily recognized. Take away characters that deal with slavery, racism, and the thugnificent lifestyle, and it becomes obvious that the video game industry believes that Black characters and stories are only compelling when we have to fight against those who are meant to smother us in society. Kelley, an expert actors and writers working in Hollywood, gave me insights on the difficult way game stories can handle these issues and generally deliver an underwhelming experience. Criminal, slave, and a form of racism. These are all simple obstacles, that you can build your story around. What should happen to people, told Kelley. As far as the characters are concerned, these are the things Black people have to overcome, mainly because these are the things we often talk about about we should overcome. So they just take the past what is out of our mouth and put them into the games, and they start selling the games. But I think they’re concerned about that they aren’t aware of all of the characters. I think that most people just stand there and comment on it all. But they don’t understand. Now, go to Deathloop. This is a single-year contender with a single-player title and a resemblance of Blackmen. I can see the pictures from Colt and Juliana and know they’re black. I can see how their voices become ambiguous, and I can imagine the differences between the two genders and the color that they have. I can see their Black excellence because being Black is not what they are, but who they are. It’s comparable to the difference between a win-off game and a legitimate title. Imitations don’t get what I mean by “authentic” sentences. What unifies Deathloop’s theme and explains how it’s been done. We all have specific areas that, again, can become seriously overlooked when someone else is constructing a character from scratch and simply doesn’t know our idiosyncrasies, says Kelley. And it seldom gets missed, and sometimes when it hits it, it gets cut. You have the kind of response that everyone has got, and that’s refreshing. As a singer, and as a singer, it’s very refreshing to see these kinds of things. And [Black players] see this, and they feel that, and they are talking about it. I hadn’t known what what happened, except in video games. Our narrative designer Bennett Smith kept on telling me, Jason, hang on, it’ll blow you mind what happens and it has. Dinga Bakaba created a wonderful game and characters from real high quality. And I appreciate how well I voted for Colt, and the Ozioma Akagha will say the same thing about Julianna. The fun of playing these characters was so amazing. Often, stories stop and show how awesome Blacks are to accomplish a very human feat, but in Deathloop Colt is the Head of Security for the AEON Programme and a very good engineer, while Julianna has encyclopedic knowledge and a hard-playing master. They are examples of what human beings do. This is not an inspiring showcase that Black people work as humans. That world respects them by treating them as people. It doesn’t have to remind you they are black, and it’s also not forcing them to be like their peers in order to be accepted. Most games have to remind you how daunting it can be to be Black, while Deathloop doesn’t need to, because there’s no need. What’s even more impressive is that the story of Colt and ultimately Juliana isn’t tied to any preconceived notions of Blackness, which suggested gamers are often confused with understanding what it means to be Black. Colt is going to sleep and is trying to figure out what happened. Compare it to The Walking Dead and Yvese Everett who is handcuffed when we meet him first. That doesn’t make Lee lesser, but it’s free to see a Black person thrive without being weighed down by a narrative that never seems to deviate from societal excesses. The accident never happened. All the directors, writers, and actors who combine work to make these characters real are conscious. People tend to believe that we have black characters, because there are not many Black people in the industry, but the pieces are now here. An associate or Juliana could have an open mind in every game released, and not just something happening once a decade. As far as Jason Kelley is concerned, while the need for Black people to join games like Black characters is limited. All those that are diverse can speak about their own things, but I create things to enjoy with Black people. If you produce amazing content and consciously choose people which aren’t like you, you’ll be fine. Your money will go away. You’ll make good progress. No one will blame you for saying Oh, that the world has many other people and I am going to cast them. Let me build them digitally in these worlds and let them play. And let me find the best people I could find. The best talent I could find. Let me jump into my pocket and cut a check. After this, you noticed that you were a different person. If your position is to cut the check, or to let others create the games, or if you want to play a game that is appropriate for everybody, not even a momentous occasion. In an extreme sense, as much for what you want, a simple action is not a problem. It isn’t acceptable to place every character that features a POC, a LGBTQ+ person or a disabled person in the same category. We are all distinct with many varied and beautiful stories each need to be told entirely because Brown comes in many colors. Colt is a critical Black character and it’s not a taboo thing to say. Deathloop shows us that, even if a black experience is well known, you don’t need to alienate anybody. I think it’s time for Colt and Juliana to list Black characters, but today I will discuss who will make up the top ten list, not having to fight on the top to find 10 real Black characters. For Kelley, creating authentically black characters is the most important thing in his work. If studios allow the right people to come into, I hope a day with that would soon get better. I hate diversity because diversity is the primary thing of me. I won’t talk about diversity. I speak of Black people. Kelley said. There is a lot of people who are diverse, but in an effort to bring those who want something to love. While I’m working on a character, I shouldn’t go into a character as a diversity person. It’s a Black man, but they would certainly be nice. And so I will have everything I have.\n","wordCount":"1680","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-23T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-23T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"William Castillo"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/deathloop-refines-blackness-in-video-games/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Deathloop Refines Blackness In Video Games</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-23 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 23, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1680 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;William Castillo</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>The nature of the good black characters varies, and the strangeness of the great black characters increases.
