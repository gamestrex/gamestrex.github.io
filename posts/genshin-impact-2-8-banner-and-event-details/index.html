On this page:\nGenshin Impact 2.8 Banners There is one new playable character making their debut in the 2.8 update: Shikanoin Heizou, who can be Wished for during both Phase 1 event Banners. The first of these is the Sparkling Steps Banner, featuring the 5-Star Klee. The second is the Leaves in the Wind Banner, featuring 5-Star Kaedehara Kazuha. Phase 2 marks the end of these 2.8 Banners for a rerun of Tapestry of Golden Flames, featuring 5-Star character Yoimiya. All the new and featured 5-Star Banner characters you can Wish on during the 2.8 update are:\nShikanoin Heizou (Sparkling Steps and Leaves in the Wind Banners - Phase 1): New 4-Star Anemo Catalyst character with useful AOE (area of effect) damage, grouping, and Elemental combos. Klee (Sparkling Steps Banner - Phase 1): Returning 5-Star Pyro Catalyst character with a focus on causing elemental DPS (damage per second). Kaedehara Kazuha (Leaves in the Wind Banner - Phase 1): Returning 5-Star Anemo sword-wielder best used in a Sub DPS Support role. Yoimiya (Tapestry of Golden Flames - Phase 2): Returning 5-Star Pyro archer who is best used in a main DPS role due to her low Elemental Energy costs.\nAs well as a new free weapon, the Cursed Blade, obtainable by playing the new story content, the Epitome Invocation weapon Banner will get a usual refresh. As Klee and Kazuha have Banner reruns during Phase 1, their signature weapons (Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds and Freedom Sworn, respectively) have boosted drop rates during Phase 1, ending 2nd August. On 2nd August, the Epitome Invocation weapon Banner will then refresh again for Phase 2. It’s not been announced yet what the 5-Star featured weapon will be, but as Yoimiya’s Banner returns, her best weapon (Thundering Pulse) is then likely to be featured. As a reminder, all Phase 1 Banners will run for three weeks until 2nd August, then change to the Phase 2 Banner for three weeks until it concludes on 23rd August in preparation for big 3.0 update and new Banners.\rGenshin Impact version 3.3 is here, with new codes, and new character Scaramouche (Wanderer), so find out where he’s placed on our tier list. You’ll need Primogems and luck of the Pity and 50/50 systems to Wish with Fate for him and other current and next banners. You’ll also need the right Adventure Rank for events. For more Sumeru help, we’ve got pages on Sumeru Reputation, Tree of Dreams, Dendroculus locations, the Aeonblight Drake boss, the Garden of Endless Pillars Domain, and locations for Nilotpala Lotus, Padisarah, Scarabs, and Redcrest.\rYou can also now unlock the Genius Invokation TCG and, if you want help building your deck, check out our Genius Invokation TCG Card List.\rIf you want to relax, however, why not try fishing at one of the many fishing spot locations?\nGenshin Impact Summertime Odyssey event Along with a permanent new Story Quest centred on Kazuha (Acer Palmatum Chapter: Act 1), and a Heizou Hangout Event (Act 1 - Trap ‘Em By Storm), there are five time-limited events featured in Genshin Impact 2.8.\rThe biggest of these, Summertime Odyssey, starts Friday, 15th July and ends on Wednesday, 24th August until the 3.0 patch is live. To be eligible to take part in the Summertime Odyssey event, you must be at least Adventure Rank 32, and have completed the Archon Quest ‘Chapter II: Prologue - Autumn Winds, Scarlet Leaves’. There are a number of small events and storylines included during the encompassing Summertime Odyssey event. The biggest of these is the Phantom Realms combat challenges. For completing Phantom Realms challenges, you’ll receive Iridescent Flotsam as a reward, which can then be used in the Event Shop in exchange for goods. Accumulate 2,400 Iridescent Flotsam for a free Fischl character! There’s also a sailing minigame mode available during the Summertime Odyssey event called Surfpiercer, in which you have to complete a race course in the required time while achieving a number of bonus objectives.

You can learn the backstory of this new outfit by taking part in the Hidden Strife event. This event involves combat challenges similar to the previous Phantom Flow event, tasking you with set objectives to reach, which then give you buffs for the next challenge when completed. Other rewards you can get from the Hidden Strife event include Primogems, Mora, Mystic Enhancement Ore, EXP Materials, and weapon Ascension Materials.\nGenshin Impact Evermotion Mechanical Painting event Evermotion Mechanical Painting starts Friday, 12th August and ends on Monday, 22nd August.

You will be able to purchase it during Summertime Odyssey from the in-game Shop for 1,980 Genesis Crystals. After the 3.0 patch, however, the outfit will cost 2,480 Genesis Crystals.
You can learn the backstory of this new outfit by taking part in the Hidden Strife event. This event involves combat challenges similar to the previous Phantom Flow event, tasking you with set objectives to reach, which then give you buffs for the next challenge when completed.
Other rewards you can get from the Hidden Strife event include Primogems, Mora, Mystic Enhancement Ore, EXP Materials, and weapon Ascension Materials.</p><h2 id=genshin-impact-evermotion-mechanical-painting-event>Genshin Impact Evermotion Mechanical Painting event<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-evermotion-mechanical-painting-event>#</a></h2><p>Evermotion Mechanical Painting starts Friday, 12th August and ends on Monday, 22nd August.
To be eligible to take part in the Evermotion Mechanical Painting event, you must be at least Adventure Rank 18, and complete the &lsquo;Prologue: Act III - Song of the Dragon and Freedom&rsquo; Archon Quest.
The Evermotion Mechanical Painting event features a set of puzzles where you have to place different sizes of Gears in the correct position of each board to correctly connect all the Gears to each other.
Rewards you can get from the Evermotion Mechanical Painting event include Primogems, Mora, EXP Materials, weapon Ascension Materials, and the new Evermotion Mechanical Painting Furnishing for your Serenitea Pot.
Each event lasts a limited amount of time, so make sure you’re regularly logging in to earn all the rewards you can during the Genshin Impact 2.8 event schedule.</p><h2 id=genshin-impact-28-release-time>Genshin Impact 2.8 release time<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-28-release-time>#</a></h2><p>Announced soon after the 2.8 livestream, developer miHoYo revealed that Genshin Impact 2.8 will release on Wednesday, 13th July, after approximately five hours of server downtime starting at 6am (UTC +8).
As this is only an approximate time for how long the servers are down, you might be able to play the 2.8 patch a little before or after the times below.
Keeping this in mind, the Genshin Impact 2.8 release time for other time zones are as follows:</p><p>UK: Wednesday, 13th July, 4am (BST) Europe: Wednesday, 13th July, 5am (CEST) East Coast US: Tuesday 12th July, 11pm (EDT) Central US: Tuesday 12th July, 10pm (CDT) West Coast US:Tuesday 12th July, 8pm (PDT) Australia: Wednesday, 13th July, 1pm (AEST) New Zealand: Wednesday, 13th July, 3pm (NZST) Japan: Wednesday, 13th July, 12pm (JST)</p><p>You can pre-install some 2.8 content now on PC and Mobile devices in advance to save time when the actual 2.8 patch is available on Wednesday.
If you play on Mobile, either press the &lsquo;Pre-Install Resource Package&rsquo; icon in the bottom-left corner of the login screen, or go to the Paimon Menu and select &lsquo;Settings&rsquo;, &lsquo;Other&rsquo;, and finally &lsquo;Pre-Install Resource Package&rsquo;.
When the full update arrives, those on iOS devices must enter the App Store and tap &lsquo;Update&rsquo;. Android users can open the game and follow the directions on-screen or open Google Play and tap &lsquo;Update&rsquo;.
If you play Genshin Impact on PC, you can pre-install some of the 2.8 update by updating the Genshin Impact Launcher. After updating the launcher, a &lsquo;Game Pre-Installation&rsquo; button will appear to the left of the &lsquo;Launch&rsquo; button. Click &lsquo;Game Pre-Installation&rsquo; to download the 2.8 resources.
Have fun during the Summer Fantasia event!</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Genshin-Impact-2.8-Banners.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Genshin-Impact-2.8-Banners.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact 2 8 Banner and event details -
