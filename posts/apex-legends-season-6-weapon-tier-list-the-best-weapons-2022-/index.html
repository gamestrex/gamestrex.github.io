However, this has also implied a reduction in damage output, a huge nerf to the headshot multiplier (from 2x to 1.25x) and an increase to magazine size and rate of fire. Despite the nerfs, the Mastiff continues to remain one of the epic close-range weapons in Apex Legends, and in Season 6 it is a weapon that you can find fully-kitted, making it even more dangerous.\nR-99 The most iconic Apex Legends weapon is moved to Supply Drops in Season 6, bearing a whole host of impacts down the tier list. It’s ideal in close range with impressive speed, and buffs to damage and magazine size keep it well in the S-Tier.\nKraber You need to have tremendous luck to find this sniper rifle that can instantly plot to kill any Legend with a headshot. Don’t be afraid to go for anything you can hit – the Kraber deals big damage to all areas. Get skilled in the Training Arena first, though, as the painfully slow rate of fire implies you have to make every shot count.\nDevotion The Devotion really has backed out of supply drops, but the Energy LMG still infuses a brutal punch. Incredibly accurate and suffers from very little recoil, terming it as one of the very best weapons in Apex Legends. The remarkable part about the Devotion is the sheer damage it produces. With a little practice on the Firing Range, you won’t have to worry about losing a single 1v1 fight with this LMG in your hands, despite the reduced clip size for Season 6.\nA Tier Longbow The Longbow DMR has long been consistently performing in the Apex games. Not as powerful as a full-blooded sniper rifle, it is forgiving – aim for the head, and follow up with whatever you can hit. It can now take a Skullpiercer attachment, vastly increasing its headshot damage. The Longbow really is the best non-supply drop Sniper Rifle in Apex Legends.\nPeacekeeper A favourite in the Gfinity offices, the Peacekeeper is the most power-packed shotgun that simply sports a cool look. However, in Season 5, it is taken out of the regular weapons and added to care packages, along with some slight buffs. It has power where it counts and is able to to shred unshielded enemies, but its rarity could see its viability reduction.\nHemlok An assault rifle that fires in bursts, the Hemlock is impressively accurate considering the rate at which it can sling ammunition. That makes it ideal at anything except long range, especially with a decent optic attachment. Keep your eyes peeled for the golden Legendary Hemlok. Season 6 buffs mean less recoil, too, so the Hemlok remains a great choice.\nProwler PDW This weapon could very easily be B-tier if not for the Select-Fire hop-up which crucially lets you convert it into an assault rifle in all but name. Without it, the Prowler can be a relatively small magazine. Ensure to stock up on attachments – especially that extended mag. A bit more recoil in Auto-mode hasn’t hurt the Prowler’s effectiveness – it continues to remain a brilliant close-range weapon.\nVolt The Volt is a brand new weapon right out of Titanfall 2, and everybody wants a sneak peek at how good it is. And, to be honest, it’s really very good. The Volt takes Energy Ammo and fires it at a swift rate, destroying shields within seconds at close range. The SMG eats ammo, so ensure to pile up, and make sure to grab one of the new Extended Energy Mags to make the most of your pushes.\nR-301 Carbine A great all-rounder in Apex Legends, the R-301 is apt for mid-range entanglements. Although it offers some the best of ironsights in the game, attachments really bring out the best in the R-301, particularly a mid-range scope. The loss of anvil Rounds in Season 5 will hurt.\nG7 Scout A single-shot weapon that’s surprisingly fair even at close range, the G7 is aiming for a scope to get the best out of it. Luckily, since its reclamation as an Assault Rifle, these are much easier to come by. The rate of fire is alright and can be enhanced with the Double-Tap hop-up, but the only real limit is how fast your firing finger is!\nWingman One of Apex Legends’ most adored weapons, the Wingman continues to be the best pistol for sheer damage – but its magazine size of 4 bullets means you’ll be desperate for an extended mag where possible.\nM600 Spitfire The Spitfire possess a gigantic magazine and is pretty accurate when firing from the hip – at a lower rate of fire that keeps recoil fairly manageable.\nB Tier Havoc The Havoc is a beast, especially after a serious buff in Season 4. The Havoc has a massive firing rate it can shred shields in an instant, but multiple increases to the horizontal recoil have taken their toll. It’s an assault rifle that packs an accurate punch, although the charge time can be irritating and has the potential to be a serious threat.\nL-Star Not anymore found in care packages, the L-Star doesn't need to reload any more either – but it will get overheated if fired too often. If you pick it up, be sure to pile up on your energy ammo as without needing to reinstall can be all too easy to get careless.\nCharge Rifle A weapon that was included and consequently nerfed multiple times, the Charge The rifle needs a lead-in charge and doesn’t hold as much ammo – but hit an enemy with it and you’ll melt their protection in a heartbeat. Season 6 updated the Charge Rifle to use two sniper round per shot, but it can hold eight rounds in a clip.\nSentinel One of the new weapons included as part of Season 4, the Sentinel rewards skilled players with handsome perks. Its bolt-loaded technique means you’ll need to line-up your shots, but it remains faster than other snipers – meaning it could be a great alternative if you can’t find yourself the Longbow.\nEVA-8 Shotgun Another pretty reliable option, the EVA-8 is a decent shotgun whose real strength captures in its full-auto nature. It hits hard and fast and is an ideal weapon to keep close to you when breaching an internal area. Make sure to attach a Double-Tap Trigger to really make the most of this shotgun. Keep an eye on your ammo, as this will eat through it in moments – especially while double-tapping.\nAlternator An SMG that’s been through the wringer as far as nerfs and buffs go, the lack of Disruptor Rounds make the Alternator difficult to recommend anything other than early-game unprotected targets. An extended magazine size in Season 5 is a slight buff, but not worth picking up.\nC Tier VK-47 Flatline An assault rifle that does more damage than the R-301 and Hemlok, the Flatline ends up here crediting slow-moving rounds that make reaction to an enemy ambush feel hit and miss. Even the fact you can find it fully-kitted in Season 6 doesn't make the VK-47 a viable option.\nTriple Take A sniper rifle that makes ammo sounds like a dream come true, but in reality, the Triple Take isn’t as good as it could be. The Precision Choke is pre-built, supporting the Triple Take out a lot, as well as the fact you can now find fully-kitted variants of the sniper in Season 6.\nRE-45 A gun that can easily take you in the midst of a match, the RE-45 has manageable recoil and does cutthroat damage to unshielded opponents.\nP2020 The most ravishing pistols, the P2020 just isn’t that great to hang on. A buff to its damage in Season 6 doesn't help at all. Grabbing it early, specifically with the Hammerpoint Rounds mod, you’ll tear apart people without shields – be prepared to ditch it once they stock up.\nD Tier Mozambique Season 6: now Mozambiques have four rounds!\n","wordCount":"1367","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"John Stoica"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/apex-legends-season-6-weapon-tier-list-the-best-weapons-2022-/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Apex Legends Season 6 Weapon Tier List The Best Weapons 2022</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 1, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1367 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;John Stoica</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#best-apex-legends-weapons-tier-list--jan-2022>Best Apex Legends Weapons Tier List – Jan 2022</a></li><li><a href=#s-tier>S Tier</a><ul><li><a href=#mastiff>Mastiff</a></li><li><a href=#r-99>R-99</a></li><li><a href=#kraber>Kraber</a></li><li><a href=#devotion>Devotion</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#a-tier>A Tier</a><ul><li><a href=#longbow>Longbow</a></li><li><a href=#peacekeeper>Peacekeeper</a></li><li><a href=#hemlok>Hemlok</a></li><li><a href=#prowler-pdw>Prowler PDW</a></li><li><a href=#volt>Volt</a></li><li><a href=#r-301-carbine>R-301 Carbine</a></li><li><a href=#g7-scout>G7 Scout</a></li><li><a href=#wingman>Wingman</a></li><li><a href=#m600-spitfire>M600 Spitfire</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#b-tier>B Tier</a><ul><li><a href=#havoc>Havoc</a></li><li><a href=#l-star>L-Star</a></li><li><a href=#charge-rifle>Charge Rifle</a></li><li><a href=#sentinel>Sentinel</a></li><li><a href=#eva-8-shotgun>EVA-8 Shotgun</a></li><li><a href=#alternator>Alternator</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#c-tier>C Tier</a><ul><li><a href=#vk-47-flatline>VK-47 Flatline</a></li><li><a href=#triple-take>Triple Take</a></li><li><a href=#re-45>RE-45</a></li><li><a href=#p2020>P2020</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#d-tier>D Tier</a><ul><li><a href=#mozambique>Mozambique</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h2 id=best-apex-legends-weapons-tier-list--jan-2022>Best Apex Legends Weapons Tier List – Jan 2022<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-apex-legends-weapons-tier-list--jan-2022>#</a></h2><h2 id=s-tier>S Tier<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#s-tier>#</a></h2><h3 id=mastiff>Mastiff<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#mastiff>#</a></h3><p>The Mastiff was pulled out of care packages and placed in the overworld for Season 5, leading to extensive use of the deadly shotgun.

The Precision Choke is pre-built, supporting the Triple Take out a lot, as well as the fact you can now find fully-kitted variants of the sniper in Season 6.</p><h3 id=re-45>RE-45<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#re-45>#</a></h3><p>A gun that can easily take you in the midst of a match, the RE-45 has manageable recoil and does cutthroat damage to unshielded opponents.</p><h3 id=p2020>P2020<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#p2020>#</a></h3><p>The most ravishing pistols, the P2020 just isn’t that great to hang on. A buff to its damage in Season 6 doesn't help at all. Grabbing it early, specifically with the Hammerpoint Rounds mod, you’ll tear apart people without shields – be prepared to ditch it once they stock up.</p><h2 id=d-tier>D Tier<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#d-tier>#</a></h2><h3 id=mozambique>Mozambique<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#mozambique>#</a></h3><p>Season 6: now Mozambiques have four rounds!</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/announcing-the-egx-pub-quiz-2022/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Announcing The Egx Pub Quiz 2022</span></a>
