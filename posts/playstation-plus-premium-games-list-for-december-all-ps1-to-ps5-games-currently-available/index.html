from the original PS1 to the PS5, as well as the PSP and, thanks to streaming, PS3 support.
Now available in all territories, at launch the roster appears to be omitting some iconic franchises - there&rsquo;s no Gran Turismo, for example - but there are plenty of classics from all generations to discover - from Jumping Flash!, Ape Escape and the Jak series in the early years, through to Demon&rsquo;s Souls, Returnal and Miles Morales on PS5.
Third party games will be available too - including access to a &ldquo;curated&rdquo; version of the Ubisoft+ subscription.
What follows is the currently available PlayStation Plus Premium games list - with notable games from other regions listed and noted as such. New Extra / Premium games will be available in the middle of the month, while Essential tier games available on the first Tuesday of the month.
