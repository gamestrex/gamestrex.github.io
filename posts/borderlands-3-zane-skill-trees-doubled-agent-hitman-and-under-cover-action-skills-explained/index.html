On this page: If you’re looking for the other character skills trees, then check out our Skill Trees guides for Amara, Fl4k and Moze. As you spend Skill Points in the various Skill Trees, you’ll unlock Action Skill Augments, which will add new features to your chosen Action Skills. Zane can have 2 Action Skill Augments equipped to each Action Skill. This means that you will be using a total of 4 Action Skill Augments in total. Take your time to investigate what each individual Action Skill Augment does to ensure that you’ve made your Action Skill as powerful as possible. Nearly all of the Abilities in the Double Agent Skill Tree allow you to upgrade or take advantage of the Digi-Clone in some way. Quick Breather will instantly recharge Zane’s shield after he swaps places with his Clone, while Old-U allows you to escape Fight for Your Life, with full health, by destroying the Digi-Clone. The Action Skill Augments follow this strategy by helping you make the Clone more deadly. Doppelbanger lets you treat the Clone like a grenade, attacking nearby enemies with Splash Damage when it vanishes. If you reach the very end of the Skill Tree, you’ll be able to unlock Double Barrel. This will give the Clone a copy of your currently equipped gun, making both of you near unstoppable on the battlefield.

If you’re playing using this Skill Tree, then you should try to keep kill every foe you encounter fast, as it will allow you to keep the Ability Boosts for as long as possible. Luckily, Abilities like Cool Hand and Violent Violence will increase Zane’s Reload Speed and Fire Rate, helping you achieve this goal. The Hitman Action Skill will also help you kill as many enemies as possible. The SNTNL drone will fly across the battlefield, taking out your enemies and adding to your kill bonuses. Action Skill Augments will allow you to customise the SNTNL with Elemental Damage, like Cyro Damage, and even give it the ability to shoot rockets. If you invest all the way to the end of the Hitman Skill Tree, you’ll unlock Seein’ Red. This will activate all Zane’s Kill Skills just from activating one of his Action Skills, making you a true force to be reckoned with.

These are important stats to invest in, especially if this is your first Borderlands game and you’re still getting the hang of things. As the Skill Tree progresses, the Skill Tree does become more aggressive by helping you deal Cryo Damage to your enemies. You can take advantage of by investing in the Refreshment Ability, which will allow you to regain health from damaging frozen enemies. The Action Skill for Under Cover also keeps to this shield theme by giving you the Barrier. This is a movable shield that can protect you, your allies, while also providing some important Gun Damage bonuses. If you’re planning to use the Barrier, then it’s worth unlocking the Action Skill Augment, All-Rounder. This transforms the Barrier into a dome, providing protection on all sides. This Augment could be the turning point in a battle, giving you the protection you need from a horde of foes. Action Skill for the Under Cover Skill Tree - Barrier - creates a Barrier that blocks incoming projectiles\nZane and his allies can shoot through the barrier for increased Gun Damage Can be picked up, but the size and bonuses will be reduced Duration: 14 seconds Cooldown: 24 seconds Damage Amp: +25%\nUnder Cover Skill Tree - Tier 1 Under Cover Skill Tree - Tier 2 Under Cover Skill Tree - Tier 3 Under Cover Skill Tree - Tier 4 Under Cover Skill Tree - Tier 5 Under Cover Skill Tree - Tier 6 Borderlands 3 has arrived!

As you level up “Jack’s” skill trees, these Digi-Jacks can be modified to have stronger weapons or even spawn at the Badass rank. It’s possible that levelling up Zane’s Digi-Clones will work in a similar way, allowing you to modify them with weapons or maybe even add a shield.
