The exceptional performance and the interesting dynamic of the EMEA teams has been rewarded for a new level of interest. Riot Games have been following this development very closely. That was one of the reasons they decided to change the EMEA ecosystem in 2022 so they could add more layers. This should allow more players, from amateurs to pro players, to participate in the competition Valorant scene and to play it big. The Valorant staff said that in one of their recent announcements: “There were two main things that went into effect.” In 2022, we aspire to become the world’s largest aficionados and its impressive performance proves its potential. Eventually, EMEA is evolving to be a powerhouse region. Though they are just kicking things off with the EMEA region, for obvious reasons, these same changes will likely impact all over the Valorant regions over time.

It’s great seeing Riot expand on an already tested formula and I’ve been excited to see how it’s going to be 2022.\nA construction of the VCT OEMEA 2022 structure. If you remember this years VCT pyramid structure, you know that there were only three layers of VCT Challengers, Masters, and finally Champions.

The VCT EMEA regions Game Changers will have three tournaments to attend in February, May and September. The team which succeeds here will qualify for the Global Game Changers in November. The Game Changers Academy is among the new innovations.
