If you’re a fan of Batman – or just any action game in general – this is a deal you won’t want to miss out on.\rFor those unfamiliar, the Batman Arkham games are their own self-contained releases based on the popular DC character that not only tell well-written stories, but also allow you to explore and poke around an open world full of stories and secrets that link to the greater Batman universe as a whole. Arkham Origins, which isn’t included in this bundle, is also on sale for £3.29, meaning you can get the entire Arkham quadrilogy for less than a tenner!\nBatman: Arkham Collection on PC (via Steam) – £6.49 (was £49.99) Batman: Arkham Origins on PC (via Steam) – £3.29 (was £14.99)\nFar Cry 6 Gold Edition Far Cry 6 is an FPS set in the open world playground of Yara, a -as the description reads – “tropical paradise frozen in time”.

This particular deal lets you pick up the game in all three versions – Standard, Deluxe and Gold. Standard will net you the base game on its own with all free post-launch updates included as a downloadable update, whereas the Deluxe Edition throws in three extra pieces of downloadable content (DLC): the Jungle Expedition, Croc Hunter and Vice.packs.\rThe Gold Edition on the other hand, includes the base game, the aforementioned DLC packs, and the game’s season pass, opening up three extra pieces of content each focused on villains from previous games, including Vaas from Far Cry 3.

Whatever your answer, Resident Evil 4’s European village invites you into one of the highest-rated survival horror titles of all time, now remade from the ground up in Capcom’s RE Engine – the development engine behind the most recent Resident Evil titles from the past few years. Saddling up as a now-more experienced Leon S. Kennedy, it’s your task to save the President’s daughter, surviving the nightmare along the way.\rThis remake of Resident Evil 4 doesn’t release until March 24th next year, but Capcom have already shown various bits of gameplay, sharing some details, speaking on its “reimagined storyline and modernised gameplay” and the return of the iconic Merchant.\rWith the available deals on Fanatical, you’re able to pick up the game in both Standard and Deluxe variants – the latter of which containing bonus costumes, accessories and weapons on top of the game.
