As well as a selection of games from third-party publishers, you can expect all future Xbox Game Studios games to be arriving day-in-date on the service. Added to the roster in recent years are Zenimax’s games (think Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Doom, Wolfenstein) following the publisher’s acquisition in March 2021, and the likelihood of all future Activision Blizzard games once that deal with Microsoft is done. As well as Xbox Game Pass on console, there’s also Xbox Cloud Gaming and a separate PC subscription called PC Game Pass. Though many games will appear on all three platforms, this article only lists Xbox Game Pass games on the Xbox family of consoles. Those on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate get access to all three services, Gold membership and access to EA Play games. Xbox Game Pass updates come regularly - to both add and remove games - so it’s worth coming back to see what’s been added. If you want to see our picks for what’s worth playing, see our best Game Pass games recommendations.

As well as a selection of games from third-party publishers, you can expect all future Xbox Game Studios games to be arriving day-in-date on the service. Added to the roster in recent years are Zenimax&rsquo;s games (think Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Doom, Wolfenstein) following the publisher&rsquo;s acquisition in March 2021, and the likelihood of all future Activision Blizzard games once that deal with Microsoft is done.
As well as Xbox Game Pass on console, there&rsquo;s also Xbox Cloud Gaming and a separate PC subscription called PC Game Pass. Though many games will appear on all three platforms, this article only lists Xbox Game Pass games on the Xbox family of consoles. Those on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate get access to all three services, Gold membership and access to EA Play games.
Xbox Game Pass updates come regularly - to both add and remove games - so it&rsquo;s worth coming back to see what&rsquo;s been added. If you want to see our picks for what&rsquo;s worth playing, see our best Game Pass games recommendations.
