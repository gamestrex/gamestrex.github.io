For one hour, the chosen Pokemon will appear more frequently in the wild, allowing you to catch as many as you can. This could help you fill in a missing entry in the Pokédex or find a strong Pokémon for raiding. Meanwhile the bonus will provide you with important assistance on your Pokémon journey. This could be anything from double transfer candy, allowing you to evolve Pokémon faster, or double catch stardust. Like with the established Community Day event, Spotlight Hour is designed to get players out playing Pokémon Go as part of a community. On this page: The first is to ensure that you have enough Poké Balls and berries. You only have an hour to catch as many of the chosen Pokémon as possible - you don’t want to waste it spinning PokéStops. The second is to ensure that you have space left in your Pokémon Storage Box. Just like with items, you don’t want to waste some of the Spotlight Hour transferring unwanted Pokémon, unless the current bonus is double transfer candy. Thirdly, it’s worth checking to see if you have any spare lures. Using a lure will increase the amount of Pokémon you encounter in the wild for half an hour, so, if you use one during the Spotlight Hour, it should also help you encounter more of the mystery Pokémon. Finally, since Mystery Bonus Hour has now been merged with this event it’s a good idea, depending on the bonus, to use a spare Lucky Egg or Star Piece during this hour. This will further increase the XP or Stardust bonus you receive, which is a great advantage if you’re trying to climb the level ranks of Pokémon Go quickly, or to build out your team for the Go Battle League. Used wisely and with the right Spotlight Bonus, it’s an effective way to get XP fast in Pokémon Go. The Season of Mythical Wishes continues with the Winter Holiday event, which has brought Mega Glalie to Pokémon Go. Don’t forget to partake in the new Go Battle League season. Elsewhere, be sure to use Daily Adventure Incense for the chance of encountering Galarian Articuno, Galarian Zapdos and Galarian Moltres.\nFebruary 4th - Onix February 11th - Spoink February 18th - Increased spawns for all Pokémon February 25th -
