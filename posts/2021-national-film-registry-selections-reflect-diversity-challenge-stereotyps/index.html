Everybody gathers to discuss the details of their work in the 2011 documentary What Amazing Shadows, alongside Christopher Nolan, Rob Reiner, Tim Roth, George Takei, John Singleton, Gale Anne Hurd, Charles Burnett, Zoey Deschanel, John Waters, Leonard Maltin and many more. Of the more harrowing reasons of this film is that, while he created the registries in 1988, along with the passing of the Act of the Film Preservation, almost 80 percent of the silent movie era was lost to time already. I think what they see and hear is one-third of the million others who whose film hardened from neglect in the backrooms of studios – the one who refuses to store things as merchandise, it’s a waste of time and teaches me not what is stored as art. The restoration artist called them hockey pucks. All films selected for National Film Registry are stored in an actual building located at the Library’s Packard Campus in Culpeper, Virginia. In this facility there are currently over 92,000 items which include films, television programs, radio-tunnels and sound recordings. Not all of these are of course national registry status. Films are helping reflect our cultural history and creativity, and show us new ways to look at ourselves, even though movies have never always been considered worthy of preservation. The National Film Registry will preserve our cinematic heritage, and we will bring 25 more films this year, said Lori Hayden, Librarian of Congress. The Library of Congress will work with the actors to help preserve them for generations.

Films that are awarded preservation are the test of time and not always those given prestigious awards. 2001: A Space Odyssey, for example, is a celebrated and respected cinema. As well as the nomination in the National Academy of Film in 1991, nominated for Best Picture.
7 movies inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Preservation for these films is a work of hard work executed by film historians, filmmakers and restoration artists alike. Everybody gathers to discuss the details of their work in the 2011 documentary What Amazing Shadows, alongside Christopher Nolan, Rob Reiner, Tim Roth, George Takei, John Singleton, Gale Anne Hurd, Charles Burnett, Zoey Deschanel, John Waters, Leonard Maltin and many more.
Of the more harrowing reasons of this film is that, while he created the registries in 1988, along with the passing of the Act of the Film Preservation, almost 80 percent of the silent movie era was lost to time already. I think what they see and hear is one-third of the million others who whose film hardened from neglect in the backrooms of studios – the one who refuses to store things as merchandise, it’s a waste of time and teaches me not what is stored as art.
The restoration artist called them hockey pucks.
All films selected for National Film Registry are stored in an actual building located at the Library’s Packard Campus in Culpeper, Virginia. In this facility there are currently over 92,000 items which include films, television programs, radio-tunnels and sound recordings. Not all of these are of course national registry status.
Films are helping reflect our cultural history and creativity, and show us new ways to look at ourselves, even though movies have never always been considered worthy of preservation. The National Film Registry will preserve our cinematic heritage, and we will bring 25 more films this year, said Lori Hayden, Librarian of Congress. The Library of Congress will work with the actors to help preserve them for generations.
