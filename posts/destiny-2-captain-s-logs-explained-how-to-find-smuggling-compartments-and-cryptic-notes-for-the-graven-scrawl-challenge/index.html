They also open the way to smuggling compartments, which are hidden areas dotted throughout the ship, which are also time gated for each week. And no - the Captain’s Logs are unfortunately not at all related to Star Trek. On this page: Captain’s Logs are dropped automatically on each completion of Presage once you have completed it the first time. In other words, once you have finished Presage a second time, giving you your first random roll Dead Man’s Tale drop, you’ll get your first Captain’s Log. New Captain’s Logs were introduced into the game on a weekly basis (following each Tuesday reset). This meant you were encouraged to replay Presage weekly, earning you another chapter in the Captain’s Log in the progress. Captain’s Logs also unlock smuggling compartments on the Presage for future playthroughs. These are doors which are previously locked, and can be opened by finding tablets dotted throughout the ship. Each Captain’s Log links to a specific smuggling compartment, unlocked in sequence, which is available to access on your next playthrough. Up until January 2022, this was time gated - meaning you had to wait until next reset for the following compartment to open. However, at the tail end of the Year, this no longer applies - meaning you can run it multiple times in a week and find a new Captain’s Log each time. In summary, Captain’s Logs and smuggling compartments work like so:\nOn your second Presage completion, your first Captain’s Log will unlock A new Captain’s Log will be made available - so to get all Captain’s Logs, complete Presage 12 times Each Captain’s Log you collect will allow you to open a new smuggling compartment somewhere on the Presage on a future playthrough\nThough Captain’s Logs are obtained automatically, you need to actively find each smuggling compartment they each unlock by locating a tablet and then opening the chest inside to tick it off the list. After the second left turn is a vent you can shoot behind some fungus. Inside here is a tablet on the ground, which you can scan. Once done, the door in this area will open, revealing a chest. If the tablet does not want to be scanned, then make sure you have completed Presage twice before this - granting you the first Captain’s Log which allows you to do so. On this corner is a tablet. Scan it, and then turn around to see the door which has opened in the ground behind you. In this room, take the path along the right side, to find the tablet on the ground. Scanning this opens the door to the right, where you can find the chest. After throwing the first switch, and using the buff to get past the burning wall, you drop down before jumping up again. In this area before you jump up and continue, there is a tablet on the ground next to a door in the far corner. Scan this, and the door will be open to you. You’ll then need another buff - found on the ledge above and behind of where you dropped down - to access the chest inside. It’s December, which means the return of The Dawning and Moments of Triumph 2022!\rElsewhere, the Season of the Seraph is here alongside More than a Weapon, Seraph Key Codes and Resonate Stems and the addition of Rose in Crucible.\rWe’ve also seen a new dungeon, Spire of the Watcher, with has a chance of Hierarchy of Needs dropping upon completion.\rEarliear this year we had the arrival of King’s Fall and King’s Fall challenges, plus weapons including Doom of Chelchis and Touch of Malice.\rFor The Witch Queen, learn how to get Dead Messenger and Parasite.\rAfter you jump out and before you go out ahead, there is a door on your left. In this room, take the left side, and find the tablet you can scan on the ground. The door it opens is to the left, where you can find the chest. To find the chest, jump back up into the trash compactor, and locate another floor panel which has opened with the location. After you pass the red-tinted corridor is a dark section, and that’s where you’ll find the tablet, on the ground next to a door on the left, which will open after you interact with it. Head here and interact with the tablet on the ground to open the door and grab the chest. In the latter hangar, where there’s a ship suspended you can use to climb up to the vents above, is a door at the far end. Next to it is a tablet on the ground here you can interact with, opening the door, leading the way to the chest. As soon as you enter the initial room, turn right to find a door in the corner with the tablet on the floor. Interact with this to open the door and get the chest. With that done, the Tucked Away Triumph is complete!
