A world on which lands of all sizes float in the cloud. Gods forsaken this world. Several times the ancient enemy tried to rule and conquer the world with his overwhelming force, but the citizens of the skies repelled the invaders, thereby advancing into a new era of peace. On a disputed island, a letter left behind by your father telling you to take off for a legend island. On the left, you meet a mysterious girl named Lyria, inevitably setting the wheels of fate in motion. Welcome to the Zegagrande Skydom! The legendary island of the Astrals, Estalucia, has been sitting on the riverside waiting to greet you obnoxious travelers. But until then, the journey continues to the west, where it will unfold a new story. Born to the Wind, people from the cloud under the tree were thomping, and grew up in the shadow. The Skyman is home to a multitude of islands and people of different kinds. Five races joined up to shape the civilisation. Humans may not seem like special, but they play the largest role in society. A rich eye and attractive look make Erunes easily distinguishable. Many people are blessed with magic talent. Harvins are bigger, but their wisdom and business acumen are a bit useless. Draphs have big horns and strong physical activity. All over the country, who possess their strength, work hard. Primal Beasts, Living Weapons Made by the Astrals. Astrals created these great beasts with godlike powers. Following the war which ended approximately 500 years ago, the remaining beasts fell into a slumber all over the sky, where their presence influenced the local customs. Primal creatures only obey the Astrals. This means that a wakened primal will rampage resemble a grand-scale calamity.

Take your crew off, and take a different route. Lyria A young man, and he is known for her secrets, has the power to control primal beasts. The Erste Empire granted this ability and secretly held her captive until the guard called Katalina, who used to protect her, got her to escape. The empire moved them to the forests of Zinkenstill where you encountered the pair. You tried to protect Lyria and went to the hospital with the fatal injuries. Lyria put her life on hold, and the world has kept on holding it. Vyrn Little Black Dragon. Your best friend is that little guy who’s stuck with you through so thick and thin, and he’s not about to let something like this happen to him right now. Some people may even call it fate. Katalina (easy to play) Protector with wind, for instance. Katalina swore the Erste Empire in the honor of the Golden Age, but a long time ago she was lost. Her knightly duties remain, even though she still serves to protect Lyria. Rackam (playable) Skybound Navigator! He is the airship’s aviator, as far as the open air is bare. Io (playable) I think you’re the one who moves inwardly. Don’t let her small size fool you. This young artist works tirelessly to showcase his impressive talent. He vows to see the world like smiles. Eugen has fun. A combatant can travel. A veteran skyfarer who uses combat skills is unfair only by his regret. Rosie (playable) Watchers on Skybound. A bystander whose roots are in perfect harmony with the present and present. Rolan A proper gentleman who calls the westerly skies home. Only when you meet him is by coincidence. In fact, he will decide to travel with you for the moment. Lancelot (playable) Twinfang-Prodigy. Captain of the white dragons, the knightly Order of the White Dragons. Though he was young, he wasn’t able to be an entire kingdom’s leader. Vane (playable) The Knight of Fellowship is. He forged a good fortune to protect his homeland, friends and brother-in-law. Asexualities (playable). The Lord of Flames. A young man devoted to the birth of the kings, and works hard to create a free of war with other people like-minded people. Siegfried (playable) Dragonslayer. Having once been traitor, that wouldn’t stop this loyal knight from stopping from rescue his kingdom from destruction. Charlotta (playable) Saint and Saint-Laurent. The captain of the order of santhers, all who sworn a sacred promise, was the captain. Her sword, which is a weapon of strength that cleaves evil in a two tyre, is equal to her in size and power. Yodarha is (playable) and is an effective game. Freemasonry is an illegal fencer. This man was once a world-renowned swordsman, but he spends most of his time fishing in seclusion.
