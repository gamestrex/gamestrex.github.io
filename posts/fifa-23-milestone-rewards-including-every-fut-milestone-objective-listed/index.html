You can improve your team by trading and spending FUT Coins - some of which can be earned by completing Milestone Objectives. It’s also a good idea to learn how Squad Battles and Champions work in FIFA 23. We also have an OTW tracker and RTTK tracker.\rChemistry has been completely changed in FIFA 23 too and don’t forget about the wide variety of Skill Moves, and make sure to claim your Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond rewards in FUT while you can!\rFinally, if you need help building the perfect team, we have pages on the best players overall, best Premier League players and fastest players. Along with FIFA 23’s best lengthy players, wonderkids, best strikers, best wingers, best midfielders and best defenders.\rThe trick with these sets is that they can be completed in any game mode, including friendlies. You and your friend should both assemble full bronze squads, then go into a friendly together. If you use the Max Chemistry mode, it doesn’t even matter what players you pick or where you play them - they will perform to their maximum ability. One player should be allowed to score, then the player who is 1-0 down quits. This counts as a victory towards the first player’s bronze objectives. Then simply swap around and repeat. Do it 15 times apiece, which won’t take long with quit-outs, and you have unlocked a handful of decent starter packs. You can then repeat this for silver squads. If you have to do it the hard way on your own, the easiest thing to do is go into ‘Couch Play’ friendlies, press L2/LT to go to Game Settings, reduce the difficulty to ‘Beginner’, score a goal with your bronze or silver team, then AFK until the end of the match. You will need to press a few buttons to get through the half-time break, but otherwise you shouldn’t have to do anything, as the Beginner AI is deliberately incapable of scoring. It will take a long time this way – an average of 15 minutes per match for 30 games across bronze and silver squads – but if you have the luxury of putting on an AFK game now and then while you work, watch something on your phone or listen to a podcast, it will get done. Take a close look at the Finishing Mastery and Assist Mastery objective sets. In Finishing Mastery, you can earn a Rare Players Pack (worth 50k coins) by scoring 100 finesse goals, and you can unlock a Jumbo Rare Players Pack (worth 100k) by scoring 500 goals with a squad rating of 85+. Then over in Assist Mastery, there’s a Jumbo Rare Players Pack available for assisting 500 times with a squad rated 75+. The great thing about these objectives is that you can complete them in any FUT game mode on any difficulty setting, including ‘Beginner’ friendlies. As with the bronze and silver objective sets above, assemble a squad that fits the requirements, then head into ‘Couch Play’ friendlies, hit L2/LT to go to Game Settings, and choose ‘Beginner’ difficulty. If you are struggling with the squad rating requirements, remember that loan cards do not get used up by friendlies, so you can use your 91-rated Mbappe loan from Moments mode to boost the rating. Then simply load into a match in any friendly type you like, and begin scoring as many goals as you can with finesse shots. Make sure to complete a pass before scoring (not always the case if you regain possession from AI kickoff) to add in an assist towards that objective. It is possible to score 30-40 goals per match against the lowest AI difficulty, so it will still take a few hours to get these done, but the extra players, especially walkouts, that you can expect to see from Jumbo Rare Players Pack, could well make it worthwhile if you are struggling to put together a competitive team. At the very least, you will end up with a lot of handy fodder for Squad-Building Challenges.\n","wordCount":"2390","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-20T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mei Bock"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/fifa-23-milestone-rewards-including-every-fut-milestone-objective-listed/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Fifa 23 Milestone Rewards Including Every Fut Milestone Objective Listed</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 20, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;12 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2390 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Mei Bock</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#assit-mastery>Assit Mastery</a></li><li><a href=#bronze-squad>Bronze Squad</a></li><li><a href=#champions-mastery>Champions Mastery</a></li><li><a href=#co-op-mastery>Co-Op Mastery</a></li><li><a href=#draft-mastery>Draft Mastery</a></li><li><a href=#finishing-mastery>Finishing Mastery</a></li><li><a href=#first-owned>First Owned</a></li><li><a href=#live-friendlies-mastery>Live Friendlies Mastery</a></li><li><a href=#moments-mastery>Moments Mastery</a></li><li><a href=#rivals-mastery>Rivals Mastery</a></li><li><a href=#silver-squad>Silver Squad</a></li><li><a href=#squad-battles-mastery>Squad Battles Mastery</a></li><li><a href=#squad-building-fundamentals>Squad Building Fundamentals</a></li><li><a href=#stadium-development-i>Stadium Development I</a></li><li><a href=#stadium-development-ii>Stadium Development II</a></li><li><a href=#stadium-development-iii>Stadium Development III</a></li><li><a href=#transfer-market-mastery>Transfer Market Mastery</a></li><li><a href=#vanity-acquisition-i>Vanity Acquisition I</a></li><li><a href=#vanity-acquisition-ii>Vanity Acquisition II</a></li><li><a href=#vanity-acquisition-iii>Vanity Acquisition III</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>In this guide, we break down every Milestones Objective in FIFA 23, and we also take a closer look at some of them to help you get your hands on reward packs sooner than the developer intended.

You can improve your team by trading and spending FUT Coins - some of which can be earned by completing Milestone Objectives. It’s also a good idea to learn how Squad Battles and Champions work in FIFA 23. We also have an OTW tracker and RTTK tracker.
Chemistry has been completely changed in FIFA 23 too and don’t forget about the wide variety of Skill Moves, and make sure to claim your Ted Lasso and AFC Richmond rewards in FUT while you can!
Finally, if you need help building the perfect team, we have pages on the best players overall, best Premier League players and fastest players. Along with FIFA 23’s best lengthy players, wonderkids, best strikers, best wingers, best midfielders and best defenders.
The trick with these sets is that they can be completed in any game mode, including friendlies. You and your friend should both assemble full bronze squads, then go into a friendly together. If you use the Max Chemistry mode, it doesn&rsquo;t even matter what players you pick or where you play them - they will perform to their maximum ability.
One player should be allowed to score, then the player who is 1-0 down quits. This counts as a victory towards the first player’s bronze objectives. Then simply swap around and repeat. Do it 15 times apiece, which won’t take long with quit-outs, and you have unlocked a handful of decent starter packs. You can then repeat this for silver squads.
If you have to do it the hard way on your own, the easiest thing to do is go into &lsquo;Couch Play&rsquo; friendlies, press L2/LT to go to Game Settings, reduce the difficulty to &lsquo;Beginner&rsquo;, score a goal with your bronze or silver team, then AFK until the end of the match. You will need to press a few buttons to get through the half-time break, but otherwise you shouldn’t have to do anything, as the Beginner AI is deliberately incapable of scoring.
It will take a long time this way – an average of 15 minutes per match for 30 games across bronze and silver squads – but if you have the luxury of putting on an AFK game now and then while you work, watch something on your phone or listen to a podcast, it will get done.
Take a close look at the Finishing Mastery and Assist Mastery objective sets. In Finishing Mastery, you can earn a Rare Players Pack (worth 50k coins) by scoring 100 finesse goals, and you can unlock a Jumbo Rare Players Pack (worth 100k) by scoring 500 goals with a squad rating of 85+. Then over in Assist Mastery, there’s a Jumbo Rare Players Pack available for assisting 500 times with a squad rated 75+.
The great thing about these objectives is that you can complete them in any FUT game mode on any difficulty setting, including &lsquo;Beginner&rsquo; friendlies.
As with the bronze and silver objective sets above, assemble a squad that fits the requirements, then head into &lsquo;Couch Play&rsquo; friendlies, hit L2/LT to go to Game Settings, and choose &lsquo;Beginner&rsquo; difficulty. If you are struggling with the squad rating requirements, remember that loan cards do not get used up by friendlies, so you can use your 91-rated Mbappe loan from Moments mode to boost the rating.
Then simply load into a match in any friendly type you like, and begin scoring as many goals as you can with finesse shots. Make sure to complete a pass before scoring (not always the case if you regain possession from AI kickoff) to add in an assist towards that objective.
It is possible to score 30-40 goals per match against the lowest AI difficulty, so it will still take a few hours to get these done, but the extra players, especially walkouts, that you can expect to see from Jumbo Rare Players Pack, could well make it worthwhile if you are struggling to put together a competitive team. At the very least, you will end up with a lot of handy fodder for Squad-Building Challenges.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/fifa---fifa_2022-09-27_10-52-48.png/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/fifa---fifa_2022-09-27_10-52-48.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="FIFA 23 Milestone rewards  including every FUT Milestone objective listed - 2"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/fifa---fifa_2022-09-27_10-52-18.png/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/fifa---fifa_2022-09-27_10-52-18.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="FIFA 23 Milestone rewards  including every FUT Milestone objective listed - 40"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/fifa---fifa_2022-09-27_10-52-28.png/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/fifa---fifa_2022-09-27_10-52-28.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="FIFA 23 Milestone rewards  including every FUT Milestone objective listed - 52"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/fifa---fifa_2022-09-27_11-28-24.png/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/fifa---fifa_2022-09-27_11-28-24.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="FIFA 23 Milestone rewards  including every FUT Milestone objective listed - 92"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/fifa---fifa_2022-09-27_11-31-34.png/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/fifa---fifa_2022-09-27_11-31-34.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="FIFA 23 Milestone rewards  including every FUT Milestone objective listed - 48"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/fifa23-pellegrini.png/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/fifa23-pellegrini.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="FIFA 23 Milestone rewards  including every FUT Milestone objective listed - 5"></p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/ffvii-the-first-soldier-apk-obb-download-link-for-android/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Ffvii The First Soldier Apk Obb Download Link For Android</span></a>
