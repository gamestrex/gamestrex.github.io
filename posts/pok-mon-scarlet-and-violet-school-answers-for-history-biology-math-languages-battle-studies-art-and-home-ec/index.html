You need to answer three questions correctly to pass the exam and will receive 5 Exp. Candies S for doing so. You’ll also be able to continue studying history at the Academy and Raifort’s storyline.

You need to answer four questions correctly to pass the exam and will receive 5 Exp. Candies M for doing so. Like the midterm, all of these questions are multiple choice, so we’ve only listed the correct answer:\nWhat is the area within the Great Crater of Paldea called? - Area Zero How many years ago was the academy founded? - 805 years ago Which of these did not appear in the Paldea fairy tale about the four treasures? - A folding fan Which Area Zero Expedition member wrote the record of the team’s activities? - Heath How many years ago did Professor Sada / Turo invent Tera Orbs? - 10 years ago\nHistory lesson answers in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet Below you’ll find all of the answers to the questions Raifort will ask you during the history lessons in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. You don’t need to answer these questions correctly to unlock a new history lesson or continue Raifort’s storyline, but you will get a small amount of praise from her. While these questions are multiple choice, we’ve only listed the correct answer: Lesson 1:\nWhat exactly was believed to rest in the depths of the Great Crater - inside Area Zero? - Treasure\nLesson 2:\nApproximately how many years ago was it that the Paldean Empire began to rule this region? - About two thousand years ago\nLesson 3:\nApproximately how many years ago was this academy of ours established? - About eight hundred years ago\nLesson 4:\nWhat do you think these tablets were? - Wooden plans for writing on\nLesson 5:\nWhat was the name of the team that first made it to the deepest reaches of the Great Crater? - The Area Zero Expedition\nLesson 6:\nWhat is the name of the famous professor who unraveled the Terastal phenomenon mystery? - Professor Sada in Pokémon Scarlet and Professor Turo in Pokémon Violet\nMs Raifort’s story line in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet explained Ms Raifort is the history teacher in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet who has a fascination with an old Paldean fairy tale about four mysterious Pokémon. If you follow her storyline, she will place the locations of the Firescourge Shrine, Grasswither Shrine, Groundblight Shrine and Icerend Shrine on your overworld map. Not only does this make the shrines easier to find, but will allow you to fast-travel to their locations. Once you’ve caught all of the Ruinous Pokémon, she will also reward with a TM140 Nasty Plot. This TM and her mentioning she needed to send someone pure of heart to catch the Pokémon makes me wonder if she had unsettling plans for these legendary creatures… First, however, you need to follow a number of steps to grow closer with Raifort. This includes collecting of the Paldea Gym Badges in the Victory Road storyline, so that you have access to all of the lessons at the Academy. Doing this first will ensure you can complete all of the history lessons, including the midterm and final exams, in one go, rather than having to return to the Academy multiple times. Next, you need to complete the first history lesson and, afterwards, talk to Raifort in the staff room. After this, continue studying history until you’ve completed the fourth lesson. After this lesson, Raifort will appear in the Lobby by a bookshelf on the left-hand side of the ground floor. Now all you have to do is talk to her and make sure you say that you don’t believe the story is make-believe. Now, it’s time to start studying history again until you’ve passed the history final exam. With that exam passed talk to Raifort in the lobby again and she’ll place the shrine locations on your map, along with explaining the stakes! With that done, go out and catch Wo-Chien, Chien-Pao, Ting-Lu and Chi-Yu! Once you’ve caught all four, return to Raifort to learn some more about the Pokémon and receive your final reward. Hope you enjoyed learning about the history of the Paldea region!\nBiology midterm answers in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet Below you’ll find all the answers you need for the Biology midterm exam in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.\rYou need to answer 3 questions correctly to pass, which will net you 5 Exp.

You need to answer three questions correctly to pass the exam and will receive 5 Exp. Candies S for doing so. You’ll also be able to continue studying history at the Academy and Raifort’s storyline.
Here are the history midterm answers in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet:</p><p>What is the name of the geological formation in the center of the Paldea region? - The Great Crater of Paldea What was long believed to rest in the depths of Area Zero? - Treasure How many years ago did the Paldea Empire begin to rule this region? - Approximately 2,000 years ago How many years ago was this academy built? - 805 years ago Those seeking _____ need look no further than the oranges / grapes of Paldea. - Knowledge</p><h2 id=history-final-answers-in-pokémon-scarlet-and-violet>History final answers in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#history-final-answers-in-pokémon-scarlet-and-violet>#</a></h2><p>Below you’ll find all of the answers for the history final in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
You need to answer four questions correctly to pass the exam and will receive 5 Exp. Candies M for doing so.
Like the midterm, all of these questions are multiple choice, so we’ve only listed the correct answer:</p><p>What is the area within the Great Crater of Paldea called? - Area Zero How many years ago was the academy founded? - 805 years ago Which of these did not appear in the Paldea fairy tale about the four treasures? - A folding fan Which Area Zero Expedition member wrote the record of the team’s activities? - Heath How many years ago did Professor Sada / Turo invent Tera Orbs? - 10 years ago</p><h2 id=history-lesson-answers-in-pokémon-scarlet-and-violet>History lesson answers in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#history-lesson-answers-in-pokémon-scarlet-and-violet>#</a></h2><p>Below you’ll find all of the answers to the questions Raifort will ask you during the history lessons in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
You don’t need to answer these questions correctly to unlock a new history lesson or continue Raifort’s storyline, but you will get a small amount of praise from her.
While these questions are multiple choice, we’ve only listed the correct answer:
Lesson 1:</p><p>What exactly was believed to rest in the depths of the Great Crater - inside Area Zero? - Treasure</p><p>Lesson 2:</p><p>Approximately how many years ago was it that the Paldean Empire began to rule this region? - About two thousand years ago</p><p>Lesson 3:</p><p>Approximately how many years ago was this academy of ours established? - About eight hundred years ago</p><p>Lesson 4:</p><p>What do you think these tablets were? - Wooden plans for writing on</p><p>Lesson 5:</p><p>What was the name of the team that first made it to the deepest reaches of the Great Crater? - The Area Zero Expedition</p><p>Lesson 6:</p><p>What is the name of the famous professor who unraveled the Terastal phenomenon mystery? - Professor Sada in Pokémon Scarlet and Professor Turo in Pokémon Violet</p><h3 id=ms-raiforts-story-line-in-pokémon-scarlet-and-violet-explained>Ms Raifort’s story line in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet explained<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ms-raiforts-story-line-in-pokémon-scarlet-and-violet-explained>#</a></h3><p>Ms Raifort is the history teacher in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet who has a fascination with an old Paldean fairy tale about four mysterious Pokémon.
If you follow her storyline, she will place the locations of the Firescourge Shrine, Grasswither Shrine, Groundblight Shrine and Icerend Shrine on your overworld map. Not only does this make the shrines easier to find, but will allow you to fast-travel to their locations.
Once you’ve caught all of the Ruinous Pokémon, she will also reward with a TM140 Nasty Plot. This TM and her mentioning she needed to send someone pure of heart to catch the Pokémon makes me wonder if she had unsettling plans for these legendary creatures…
First, however, you need to follow a number of steps to grow closer with Raifort. This includes collecting of the Paldea Gym Badges in the Victory Road storyline, so that you have access to all of the lessons at the Academy. Doing this first will ensure you can complete all of the history lessons, including the midterm and final exams, in one go, rather than having to return to the Academy multiple times.
Next, you need to complete the first history lesson and, afterwards, talk to Raifort in the staff room.
After this, continue studying history until you’ve completed the fourth lesson. After this lesson, Raifort will appear in the Lobby by a bookshelf on the left-hand side of the ground floor. Now all you have to do is talk to her and make sure you say that you don’t believe the story is make-believe.
Now, it’s time to start studying history again until you’ve passed the history final exam. With that exam passed talk to Raifort in the lobby again and she’ll place the shrine locations on your map, along with explaining the stakes!
With that done, go out and catch Wo-Chien, Chien-Pao, Ting-Lu and Chi-Yu! Once you’ve caught all four, return to Raifort to learn some more about the Pokémon and receive your final reward.
Hope you enjoyed learning about the history of the Paldea region!</p><h2 id=biology-midterm-answers-in-pokémon-scarlet-and-violet>Biology midterm answers in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#biology-midterm-answers-in-pokémon-scarlet-and-violet>#</a></h2><p>Below you’ll find all the answers you need for the Biology midterm exam in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.

Mr Jacq in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet explained

After that, find her in the entrance hall to the right of the main desk. She will say that she feels as if she’s being watched.
Next, go to the cafeteria and head into the kitchen on the left. A student will come in and mutter about having a question for Ms. Tyme.
Finally, head out to the schoolyard, turn right, and find Ms. Tyme near the edge of the track. She’ll set up an ambush for the watching student, who turns out to be a fan from her Gym leader days. Ms. Tyme will express her appreciation for you always being there and give you 50 Rock Tera Shards for your trouble. You can use these to change your Pokémon’s Tera Type.</p><h2 id=languages-midterm-answers-in-pokémon-scarlet-and-violet>Languages midterm answers in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#languages-midterm-answers-in-pokémon-scarlet-and-violet>#</a></h2><p>Below you’ll find all the answers you need for the Languages midterm exam in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.

Firstly, find him in the staff room for a brief chat.
Next, go to the schoolyard and turn left. Mr Salvatore is near the flowerbeds with an unwell Pawmi. You will give him a Potion if there are any in your Bag.
After that, head to the Biology lab. Salvatore and Jack will be talking about the Pawmi, which is healthy but silent.
For your final encounter with Salvatore, head back to the staff room. He will be worried that the Pawmi won’t survive on its own, so you can encourage him to keep it.
By completing these steps, you will get your own Pokémon from Salvatore - a Galarian Meowth. Since this form isn’t from Paldea, this is the only way to obtain it currently in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.</p><h2 id=battle-studies-midterm-answers-in-pokémon-scarlet-and-violet>Battle Studies midterm answers in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#battle-studies-midterm-answers-in-pokémon-scarlet-and-violet>#</a></h2><p>Below you’ll find all the answers you need for the Battle Studies midterm exam in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.

She will be over on the other side of the track near the podium and you’ll do some running laps with her. She’ll give you a sandwich, but it won’t be very satisfying…

Then head to the schoolyard. Hassel is close to the entrance, just to the right. Your conversation will be interrupted by a mysterious person.
After that, go to the entrance hall. Hassel will be looking at the bookshelves to the left of the main entrance. He will apologise for leaving earlier and explain that the person was a relative of his who wanted him to return to the family as a Dragon tamer.
Finally, head back to the art room. The relative will reappear and Hassel will refuse to leave his teaching position. As an apology for witnessing all of this and a thanks for the encouragement to stay as a teacher, Hassel will give you 50 Dragon type Tera Shards. You can use these to change your Pokémon’s Tera Type.</p><h2 id=home-ec-midterm-answers-in-pokémon-scarlet-and-violet>Home Ec midterm answers in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#home-ec-midterm-answers-in-pokémon-scarlet-and-violet>#</a></h2><p>Below you’ll find all the answers you need for the Home Ec midterm exam in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.

He’ll simply ask you to visit him again some time, so find him next in the cafeteria. He’ll be bombarded with students telling him what to eat to look cool, and you can encourage him to get what he really wants - a simple peanut butter sandwich.
When you find him next in the staff room, he’ll ask for your help in finding a mysterious sweet condiment.
Head to the Home Ec classroom again and he’ll ask for some Sweet Herba Mystica. You can get this from 5 star Tera Raids, although not always.
If you give him some, he’ll be happy and reward you with a Slowpoke Cup for your picnics, as you can see in this video by Psynergy on YouTube:
