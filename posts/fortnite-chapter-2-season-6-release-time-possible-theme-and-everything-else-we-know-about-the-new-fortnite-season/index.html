On this page:\nFortnite Season 6 Battle Pass skins, including Lara Croft New Fortnite map changes New Victory Umbrella Fortnite Golden Artifacts locations Fortnite - Craft a Hunter’s Cloak\nORIGINAL STORY: Epic Games has recently confirmed that the release date for Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 6 will be Tuesday, 16th March. Going by the previous start times for Season 5, we can assuming that the start times for Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 6 are the following:\nUK - 9am (GMT) Europe - 10am (CET) East Coast US - 4am (EST) West Coast US - 1am (PST)\nKeep in mind that these are only estimates and, no matter what happens, there will be a period of downtime, along with a new patch to download. This event will continue the storyline of Agent Jones’ and the Zero Point which has been quietly running in the background of Chapter 2, before taking centre stage at the beginning of Season 5. We will also gain some hints about what will be occurring storyline wise throughout Season 6 - maybe it will have something to do with those underground Surface Hubs… Like previous season finales, Zero Crisis Finale will have a global premiere, though Epic Games is yet to release details on when this will be occurring. The event does promise to change Reality in Fortnite as we know it, so it will be interesting to see what the island looks like after the event. Zero Crisis Finale can also be completed a single player mission once Chapter 6 begins, making it the first end-of-season event to have this option. These season finales have also been exciting to watch, but, since they involve a large number of players all logging into Fortnite at the same time, people often miss out on the experience. By making Zero Crisis Finale a single player experience, Epic Games has ensured that everyone can enjoy this event and learn the new snippet of Fortnite lore. We’re assuming that the event will be focused around Agent Jones’ attempts to prevent the Zero Point from destabilising. Again. He began Season 5 by jumping into the Zero Point, travelling to the island, and over the last couple of weeks the Zero Points behaviour is becoming more erratic. Hints about the contents of Zero Crisis Finale and for Season 6 have started to appear on the official Fortnite Twitter account. The first hint comes in the form of an audio transmission, titled Reality Log 474, from Agent Jonesy. In this log we learn that a mysterious organisation called The Order has lost control of the Zero Point and, for some reason, they don’t seem to care. (Though it could be because Jonesy himself might have sped up the Zero Point’s instability by collecting bounty hunters from different dimensions…) The Order Jonesy refers to seems to be a shortened name for The Imagined Order, also known as IO, who have been lurking in the shadows since The Device event, which marked the end of Chapter 2 Season 2. During this event, Midas attempted to use the titular device to stop the storm and break the loop. While his plan was not successful, a side effect was that we temporary found ourselves within the office of one John Jones - known better as Jonesy. We, in fact, visited his office three times and, during the last visit, came face-to-face with Jones, who was not only surprised by us being in his office, but by the fact we could hear him. We later revisited this office after preventing Galactus from devouring the Zero Point, where we found the Order in red alert mode and Jonesy waking from unconsciousness on the floor. This then led directly into the opening of Chapter 2 Season 5 with Jonesy entering the Zero Point and slowly destabilising it in an attempt to protect it. A side note - the act of forcing Galactus from the island’s dimension leaves behind the space of a butterfly in the sky and butterflies seem to be a recurring theme throughout Fortnite. It will be interesting to see if this comes back… What grabbed our attention is that, in the subtitles for the audio transmission, the word reality is capitalised. This suggests to us there might a specific reality that The Order is trying to protect rather than all of reality itself or that The Order is using the Zero Point to power something they’ve created and named Reality. In the second audio transmission, we hear Jonesy attempting to access information about The Seven, only to learn that he’s had his credential revoked, giving him no choice but to access the files through another method. The Seven have been around since Season 3 of Chapter 1 and, through we don’t know exactly what their goals are, they have tried to contain the Zero Point in the past. This led to the black hole event and the creation of the second island. Though The Seven consists of seven members, only three have been named so far - The Visitor, The Scientist and The Paradigm. A popular fan theory is that the members of The Seven are actually the same person from different timelines, but this is yet to be confirmed. The Seven appears to be in opposition with The Order as, in the trailer for Chapter 2 Season 5, Jonesy’s boss tells him to avoid attracting the attention of The Seven. Though he misses that part of the call and, with his dimensional tampering, it could be that he’s done just that and it’s the reason why The Order has cut him off. Since Jonesy has seemingly been abandoned by The Order it could be he wants to contact The Seven for help in protecting the Zero Point, but we’ll have to wait for the live event and Chapter 2 Season 6 to learn exactly what his plan is. Though the latest teaser tweet does suggest that Jonesy has decided to take matters into his own hands. In the background for both audio logs, we can see a variety of images. These include pictures of Jonesy from his various appearances in Fortnite, close ups of the Zero Point, the sign on the door for the Zero Point in The Order’s building and a wolf muzzle, which could hint at new wolf inspired skins or the inclusion of wolves, similar to the loot sharks, in Chapter 2 Season 6. Reliable Fortnite leaks source ShinnaBR from Twitter did post the following image below, theorizing that the red and yellow colouring could either be the main colour scheme for the teasers or just the season. Or maybe the person who made the graphic just likes red and yellow - who knows! The Fortnite Leaks Discord server have also uncovered what could be the new PlayStation dash icon for Fortnite, which hints at a similar cube. Covered in mysterious runes, the Cube, better known as Kevin, first appeared during Season 5 and has reappeared in Seasons 6 and X. While we don’t know much about it’s origins or purpose, we know it has the ability to teleport, absorb energy and, when needed, manipulate the landscape. While Kevin has not made a physical appearance in Chapter 2, the company running Steamy Stacks is named Kevolution Energy. If you investigate Steamy Stacks you’ll discover a pool of purple liquid and the liquid at the bottom of the chimneys appears to share the same hue. Is it possible that Kevolution Energy is manipulating our favourite cube in some way? Considering Epic Games has described as the Zero Point Crisis changing Reality on the island forever, it could be that Kevin’s return, coupled with the possible destruction of the Zero Point, could see the island shifting from one possible reality to another, rather than simply having sections of another reality appear like it did during the Marvel theme Season 4. This is complete speculation though - we’re fully prepared to be wrong!.
