It’s a race against time, which means you’re going to need a really good gun. There are four new Vault Hunters for you to play as - Amara the Siren, Fl4k the Beastmaster, Moze the Gunner and Zane the Operative. Our Borderlands 3 walkthrough will give you an idea of what each story chapter will contain, including side missions you may encounter and an ideal level for your Vault Hunter to be at. On this page: Each one will take you to a new location - be it a new planet or area you haven’t been able to visit before - on your quest to stop the Calypso Twins and their cult. You’ll also have your hands full fighting robots, cultists and even a mega corporation. Every chapter in Borderlands 3 is made up of a series of objectives for you to complete. On your map, you’ll find a waypoint marker, which will tell you where to go next to complete your current objective. Story chapters flow in one and other; every time you finish one, the next will automatically begin. This means you don’t have to worry about tracking down the next chapter giver. You’ll also find a collection of side missions during your journey through the stars. Side missions appear as yellow exclamation points (!) on your map. Talk to the person or interact with the object that belongs to that exclamation point to begin the side mission. We’ve included a brief synopsis of what each chapter involves, the rewards you receive, any side missions you may encounter and an ideal level for you to be at when completing this chapter.

Try your best to complete them all though, because they reward you both EXP and some very unique weapons. You can respec your Skill Trees. Don’t let the direction that your character build is heading in? Then take yourself to the nearest Quick Change Station and, for a small fee, you can reset your Skill Trees. Put those spare guns in the bank! Borderlands 3 is full of gun and we mean full. Sadly you can only carry so many, even after you’ve fully upgraded your inventory. If find a gun that you want to use, but is above your current level, or one you don’t have the heart to sell, then put them in your bank in Sanctuary.\nListen to the Typhon logs. Throughout your journeys you’ll come across small orange pillars. These are Typhon logs, the records of the very first Vault Hunter. Listening to these records will allow you to find a Typhon Dead Drop. These contain weapons, shields and cosmetic items, like room decorations. Upgrade your ammo and inventory by visiting Marcus on Sanctuary. Do you always find yourself running out of ammo for sniper rifles? Then visit Marcus on Sanctuary and, for a price, he’ll upgrade any of your ammo, allowing you to carry more. You can also upgrade your bank and inventory. Visit Earl and spend that Eriduim. Earl has set up his black market again in the cargo hold of Sanctuary. This time he’s selling cosmetic items, including new Vault Hunter skins, emotes and room decorations.

Throughout your journeys you&rsquo;ll come across small orange pillars. These are Typhon logs, the records of the very first Vault Hunter. Listening to these records will allow you to find a Typhon Dead Drop. These contain weapons, shields and cosmetic items, like room decorations. Upgrade your ammo and inventory by visiting Marcus on Sanctuary. Do you always find yourself running out of ammo for sniper rifles? Then visit Marcus on Sanctuary and, for a price, he&rsquo;ll upgrade any of your ammo, allowing you to carry more. You can also upgrade your bank and inventory. Visit Earl and spend that Eriduim. Earl has set up his black market again in the cargo hold of Sanctuary. This time he&rsquo;s selling cosmetic items, including new Vault Hunter skins, emotes and room decorations.
