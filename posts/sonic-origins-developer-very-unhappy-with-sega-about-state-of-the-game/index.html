Well, there’s just too much scrutiny over things that both are and are not related to us, and I don’t want to sit back in silence while people are asking why and how things happened to a product they put so much hope and money into,” he said on Twitter. He added: “No, I am not fighting with Sega, and no, I have not cut off Sega. It’s a lot more complicated than that. I’m willing to do more work under the right conditions; whether they want to work with me again is an entirely separate matter.” Fans have also heavily criticised the music used in Sonic 3, adding to the discourse around the game. The game does not use the original soundtrack, instead adding new arrangements from composer Jun Senoue. It’s speculated this change is due to an ongoing rumour that Michael Jackson originally wrote music for the game, seemingly confirmed by Sonic creator Yuji Naka yesterday.
