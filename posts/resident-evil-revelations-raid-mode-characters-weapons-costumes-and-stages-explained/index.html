If you need more help, our complete Resident Evil Revelations walkthrough can assist with other sections of the game, including all Handprint locations and unlockables. There’s a lot to see and do in Raid Mode, most of which are governed by unlocks through play. Raising your player level By completing Raid Mode stages, you’ll earn EXP and slowly level up your character. As your player level increases, so too will the strength of your defences and the amount of damage your weapons do. Additionally, certain weapons in Raid Mode can only be equipped once you’ve reached a certain level. You can lower your level when joining an online co-op game if required. Scoring in Raid Mode In order to boost your player level, you’ll need to acquire EXP. This is awarded at the end of a stage, along with Battle Points (BP) and other rewards, depending on your performance. There are several main criteria for scoring at the end of a level: your aiming accuracy, the number of enemies that you killed, the amount of damage that you inflicted and received, and your clear time.Your score will also directly affect the rank that you receive at the end of a stage. Collecting and spending Battle Points (BP) Battle Points, known as BP, are used to buy weapons, weapon parts, and consumables, in the Raid Mode store between stages. BP is awarded at the end of each stage based on your performance. Additional BP can be earned for fulfilling certain criteria - namely, completing a stage without taking damage, defeating all enemies in a stage, or completing a stage at a lower-than-recommended level. If you fulfil all three criteria, you’ll get an additional Trinity Bonus, for even more BP. Earning a Trinity Bonus on Abyss mode will earn you Legendary Custom Parts. There are several additional ways to earn BP too: you can collect special BP-granting items hidden around stages, and you can sell unwanted items for extra BP. Raid Mode enemies In Raid Mode, you’ll encounter every enemy and many bosses from the single-player campaign. Frequently, these will be special buffed variants, and you’ll be able to see exactly what buffs a creature has (plus its level and its health pool) via the bar above its head. Defeating enemies will often award special items like more ammo, or bonus XP - these will be applied directly and don’t need to be collected. The four special enemy variants you’ll encounter are:\nBerserker (fist icon) - these are physically larger than their standard counterparts and have increased strength but slower movement speed Rogue (running man icon) - these are physically smaller than their standard counterparts and have increased movements speed and can attack faster Tank (shield icon) - these are physically much larger than their standard counterparts and have high defence and a lot of health, but are very slow movement Boss (crown icon) - these are physically larger than their standard counterparts and all their stats are increased\nYou won’t need to kill every enemy to complete a stage, but certain enemies must be defeated in order to proceed. On occasion, you’ll encounter special enemies known as Aculeozzo. These look like porcupine puffer fish and will often award a Weapon Case or Custom Parts when destroyed. Unlocking Raid Mode difficulty levels Initially, all Raid Mode maps are set to the easiest difficulty level, known as Chasm. To unlock the tougher Trench difficulty, you’ll need to complete all Chasm stages. Every time you complete a Trench-level stage, you’ll unlock the subsequent one at the same difficulty. Once every Trench stage has been beaten, the final, hardest difficulty setting, known as Abyss, becomes available.\nTrench (Normal) difficulty - Complete all Raid Mode stages on Chasm difficulty Abyss (Hard) difficulty - Complete all Raid Mode stages on Trench difficulty\nUnlocking Raid Mode stages When you first start Raid Mode, you’ll only have access to three stages. More can be unlocked, however, by working your way through Revelations’ single-player campaign. Upon completing the final episode in story mode, you’ll have unlocked 21 Raid Mode maps, including a bonus stage. This bonus stage, known as Ghost Ship, covers the entire Queen Zenobia. Here are the criteria for unlocking all 21 Raid Mode stages:\nStages 4-7 - Complete Episodes 1-3 in Campaign Mode Stages 8-12 - Complete Episodes 4-6 in Campaign Mode Stages 13-17 - Complete Episodes 7-9 in Campaign Mode Stages 18-20 - Complete Episodes 10-12 in Campaign Mode Bonus Stage 21 - Complete Campaign Mode\nSome weapons have special bonus properties, ranging from Speed Shot (which increases reload speed and capacity) to Sonic Assist, which expands a weapon’s hit-zone and increases its daze and stopping power. Weapons will level up as you do, and the higher a weapon’s level, the higher its firepower, auto fire, capacity, and upgrade slots. It’s possible to acquire weapons higher than your current level by finding them or purchasing them. Weapons also feature a rarity class - common, uncommon, rare, and super rare Legendary weapons - with rarer items having better stats. You can increase a weapon’s stats further by purchasing Boost items from the store. These become available once you’ve successfully cleared Trench difficulty. Raid Mode characters and costumes Before you begin a stage in Raid Mode, you’re able to select a character and costume. There aren’t just cosmetic: each character and costume grants special bonuses and certain proficiencies with different weapons - all of which are listed on the selection screen. More characters and costumes can be be unlocked as you progress through Raid Mode stages, complete different difficulty levels, reach new player levels, earn bonuses, and fulfil other criteria. Unlockable Raid mode characters:\nClive O’Brian - Reach player level 20 in Raid Mode Jack Norman - Clear all stages on Abyss difficulty in Raid Mode Morgan Lansdale - Clear all stages on Trench difficulty with an S rank in Raid Mode Raymond Vester - Reach player level 10 in Raid Mode\nUnlockable Raid mode costumes:\nJill (diver costume) - Available from the start of Raid Mode Jill (beach costume) - Obtain a super rare weapon in Raid Mode Jill (pirate costume) - Complete the Ghost Ship bonus stage in Raid Mode Chris (snow costume) - Available from the start of Raid Mode Chris (diver costume) - Reach player level 30 in Raid Mode Chris (sailor costume) - Inflict 100,000 points of damage to an enemy in one hit Parker (diver costume) - Available from the start of Raid Mode Parker (beach costume) - Earn 10 bonuses in Raid Mode Parker (Terragrigia costume) - Defeat 10,000 enemies in Raid Mode Keith (snow costume) - Complete Episodes 4-6 in Campaign Mode Keith (HQ costume) - Clear all stages on Chasm difficulty with an S rank in Raid Mode Keith (ninja costume) - Reach player level 50 in Raid Mode Jessica (snow costume) - Complete all Raid Mode stages on Chasm difficulty Jessica (diver costume) - Complete all Raid Mode stages on Trench difficulty Jessica (Terragrigia costume) - Reach player level 40 in Raid Mode Quint (snow costume) - Reach player level 5 in Raid Mode Quint (HQ costume) - Obtain all super rare weapons in Raid Mode Rachael (diver costume) - First time Trinity Bonus in Raid Mode Rachael (Ooze costume) - Available from the start of Raid Mode Hunk (default costume) - Clear all stages on Abyss difficulty with an S rank in Raid Mode Hunk (Lady Hunk costume) - Available from the start of Raid Mode\nUnlockable name colours:\nGreen - Earn an S rank on every level of Chasm difficulty in Raid Mode Blue - Earn an S rank on every level of Trench difficulty in Raid Mode Pink - Earn an S rank on every level of Abyss difficulty in Raid Mode Yellow - Get 50 bonuses Green - Get 100 bonuses Blue - Get 150 bonuses Red - Get 200 bonuses Purple - Get 244 bonuses ","wordCount":"1352","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-24T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-24T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kevin Fairey"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/resident-evil-revelations-raid-mode-characters-weapons-costumes-and-stages-explained/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Resident Evil Revelations Raid Mode Characters Weapons Costumes And Stages Explained</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 24, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1352 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Kevin Fairey</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>There are 21 stages in total, and all taken from the single-player campaign and reworked with new enemy placements and objectives to create much tougher challenges across three difficulty levels.
