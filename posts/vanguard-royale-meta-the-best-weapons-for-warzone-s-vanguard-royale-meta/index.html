Note: As of the start of Season 3, Vanguard Royale is no longer a dedicated playlist in Warzone. It’ll likely return in future seasons, where we will update our recommendations. In the meantime, this page provides an overview of the best Vanguard weapons as well - albeit not up to date as of April 2022. After spending time in Vanguard Royale following the Season 2 update, we’ve come up with the best Vanguard weapons in Warzone. On this page: Right off the bat the biggest differences comes down to the weapons pool: there are only Vanguard weapons available in this mode. This also applies to operators, vehicles, killstreaks and more. There are restrictions across the board for tonnes of equipment options, which are important to know beforehand in case you need to update your loadout. You can find a list with details below: Other standouts are the dogfighting planes and anti-air combat, environmental hazards such as bombing runs (which appear on the Tac Map and are also announced), and a larger initial circle. If you’re curious about which weapons you should go for, jump to our next sections. There are dozens of different weapons available, ranging across the categories we’ve grown used to since day one. Some guns are more familiar than others - especially if you’ve unlocked them in Warzone already - but there are others that feel like quite the standout regardless of their simplicity. When deciding upon the best weapons for Vanguard Royale, we looked at ease of use, versatility, and overall time to kill (TTK). Certain weapons like the MG42 might have a fast TTK, but are harder to use, so they didn’t make the cut. Other weapons have low recoil and large magazine capacity, but don’t hit as hard, so you might want to avoid them, as well. It’s best to find a weapon that falls in the middle, with low recoil, high damage, and plenty of ammo. But with all this in mind, what follows is a list of the best Vanguard Royale weapons across each category. As for Season 2, at the beginning not a lot has changed - but the community has discovered a hidden gem amongst the SMG category. Likewise, the PPSh-41 SMG was stealth buffed to the point of being overpowered, though it will almost certainly get fixed shortly, so we don’t advise counting on that weapon to be as powerful in the longrun. Aside from that, many weapons received slight adjustments, but the overall meta remains mostly intact. The Cooper Carbine reigns supreme due to its versatility, low recoil, and competitive TTKs, making it hard to pass up. You can equip a large 60 round drum for plenty of firepower, or a more lightweight 45 round magazine to improve mobility. That’s the thing about the Cooper Carbine: You can deck it out to feel like a long-range laser beam, with accuracy at the forefront, or a close-range SMG that prioritizes speed and a high rate of fire. For more specifics, read our best Cooper Carbine loadout guide. There will likely won’t be many matches where the Automaton isn’t present. The Automaton is reigning supreme thanks to its near non-existent recoil, daunting fire rate and easy-to-use nature. It’s probably the best weapon to just pick up and storm into multiplayer from the get-go, and until it gets nerfed significantly, it will likely remain as is. If you want to get the most out of the Automaton, see our best Automaton loadout recommendation - or if you want to see what else the class has to offer, our best assault rifles in Warzone page can help. Remember the Swiss K31? If you’re looking for a similar weapon in terms of mobility and bolt-action fire, the Type 99 gets quite close to it. Snipers are, of course, famously known for leading you to take it slow and possibly stay grounded in a specific spot waiting for the right moment to attack. But with this option you’re free to move around the map and take quick shots thanks to a fast ADS speed. Plus, it packs quite the punch if you’re aiming at least above the chest. The Vanguard marksman rifles aren’t amazing, but can be effective if you have a fast trigger finger and decent aim. In this case, the G-43 hits hard and can either be treated as a semi-auto, triple burst, or fully auto weapon. Its biggest downside is that it uses sniper ammo, meaning you’ll likely blow through your supplies quickly. With that in mind, it’s best to be deliberate with your shots. Aside from that, this is a weapon that packs a punch due to its high damage. Yes, we’re mentioning shotguns in our best weapons roundup - the Combat Shotgun is definitely worth using, especially if you like close-quarters battles. It’s not as iconic as the Einhorn Revolving in terms of design, but it’s already making strides in Vanguard Royale thanks to its sheer power. The Combat Shotgun packs more than just a punch and is deadly in close quarters, guaranteeing the ability to down an opponent in just a couple shots in many scenarios. It’s lightweight, fast, and overall daunting. If you come across one on the opposite side, you’re likely to be in trouble. If you want to get the most out of this weapon, see our best Combat Shotgun loadout recommendation. While SMGs like the MP-40, Welgun, and PPSh-41have dominated Warzone since the Vanguard integration, the Type 100 has quietly been the best all along. This is due to its incredibly fast TTK thanks to a few key attachments. You’ll want to use the Recoil Booster Muzzle for an improved fire rate, the Warubachi 134mm Rapid Barrel for an additional boost to fire rate, and the 8mm Kurz 48 Round Drums, which improves overall damage. The weapon will have some kick to it, but within 10 meters or so, you shouldn’t have any issues controlling it. For more on the best Type 100 loadout, visit our dedicated guide. The Bren LMG is one of the top-used weapons in Warzone right now, especially in Vanguard Royale. This LMG feels more like an assault rifle, with lightweight mobility. Even after numerous nerfs, the Bren still remains the best Vanguard LMG by a significant margin. But the real reason to use the Bren has to do with its low recoil and tremendous firepower.\rThis makes it extremely easy to use, even if you’re a player who struggles with long-range engagements. Full-stop, the Bren is the best long-range automatic weapon right now for a reason, so make sure you give it a try on Caldera (or even Rebirth Island). Launchers are useful, especially if you aren’t using the Overkill perk. The best Vanguard launcher is by far the M1 Bazooka. This launcher has fast ADS speeds and a tremendous amount of power, making it easy to clear out a room or finish off a downed opponent from afar.\rWe also like the M1 Bazooka because of its sights - unlike the Panzerschreck, the Bazooka’s sights don’t obstruct your view, so it’s much easier to stay on target. If you’re interested in multiplayer, we have lists of the Operators and multiplayer maps, as well as the best Vanguard weapons, including the best STG44 loadout, best MP40 loadout and best Automaton loadout, best BAR loadout, best Combat Shotgun loadout, best Type 100 loadout, and best Kar98k loadouts.\rIn other modes, we can explain the best zombies builds and best covenants.\rWhether because you like the improved agility that melee weapons can provide over using just your melee attack, or maybe because you’re reminiscent of Counter-Strike, there is a knife available in Vanguard. The FS Fighting Knife is described as a ‘CQC tactical knife’ employed for ‘fast, quiet and deadly wetwork’ - based on our experience, it certainly matches the description. The main reason to use a knife over a weapon is for the speed boost, so be sure to give it a try when getting from point A to B.\n","wordCount":"1419","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-07T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-07T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Deangelo Bouska"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/vanguard-royale-meta-the-best-weapons-for-warzone-s-vanguard-royale-meta/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Vanguard Royale Meta The Best Weapons For Warzone S Vanguard Royale Meta</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-07 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 7, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1419 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Deangelo Bouska</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>Thankfully, now that we&rsquo;ve spent enough time with all the new assault rifles, SMGs, LMGs, shotguns, and snipers, the meta is much clearer.

In other modes, we can explain the best zombies builds and best covenants.
Whether because you like the improved agility that melee weapons can provide over using just your melee attack, or maybe because you&rsquo;re reminiscent of Counter-Strike, there is a knife available in Vanguard.
The FS Fighting Knife is described as a &lsquo;CQC tactical knife&rsquo; employed for &lsquo;fast, quiet and deadly wetwork&rsquo; - based on our experience, it certainly matches the description.
