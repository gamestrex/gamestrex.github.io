Stick to this blog until the end to discover everything about the Wild Rift 2.1b yama notlari (patch notes).\nCheck out the full patch notes here: https://t.co/YroOPbMGLO pic.twitter.com/RN5OUOiALV — League of Legends: Wild Rift (@wildrift) March 15, 2021\nWild Rift 2.1b Yama Notlari Upgrades The new updates by the LOL: Wild Rift creator seem to be more promising with more powerful gaming mechanics and a slew of new additions and systems integrated. The Wild Rift 2.1b yama notlari (upgrades) brings in new champions, skins, events, runes, systems, free-to-play rotations, and items. Let’s learn about them in detail.\nChampions There are 3 iconic inclusions to the Wild Rift champion roster brought along by the 2.1b yama notlari release. These champions are:\n— League of Legends: Wild Rift (@wildrift) March 15, 2021\nLeona – The Radiant Dawn Here’s the in-game description of the Leona:\nDiana – Scorn Of The Moon Here’s the in-game description of Diana:\nPantheon – The Unbreakable Spear Here’s the in-game description of the Pantheon: Even though the latest patches are now available, Leona, Diana, and Pantheon will not be accessible until later in the patch.\nSkins The following skins are to be released during the patch 2.1 b:\nBarbecue Leona Dark Valkyrie Diana Full Metal Pantheon Dragonslayer Pantheon Infernal Diana PROJECT: Ashe PROJECT: Leona PROJECT: Vi PROJECT: Yasuo PROJECT: Zed\nEvents – The Path Of Ascension One new event is being introduced in the Wild Rift via 2.1b yama notlari upgrades which will also be made available later in the game. The event is titled Path Of Ascension and its in-game tag reads: Also Read | LOL: Wild Rift – Rakan Best Builds, Skills \u0026 More\nChampion Updates Besides the new champion added, the new patch release modifies the already existing champions in the game. Let’s see what are the new improvements made in Aurelion Sol, Soraka, Tristana, Yasuo, and Ziggs.\nAurelion Sol Given the inclusion of Liandry’s nerf, Aurelion Sol remains solid. Developers intend to nerf his strong rune Conquer as well as tune down his mid-game capacity to be more in sync with other champions. (P) Center of the Universe – Star base damage\n18/26/34/42/50/58/66/74/82/90/98/106/114/122/130 → 15/21/27/33/40/47/54/61/70/79/88/97/108/119/130\n(W) Celestial Expansion – Base damage\n25/35/45/55/65/75/85/95/105/115/125/135/145/165 → 25/32/39/46/54/62/70/78/89/100/111/122/138/154/170\n(R) Voice of Light – Cooldown\n65/55/45s → 80/65/50\nSoraka Soraka is supplied with extra star power to excel as a healer and a silencer because she is the weakest amongst her peers. (W) Astral Infusion – Base heal\n80/110/140/170 HP → 80/120/160/200 HP\n(E) Equinox – Cooldown\n22/20/18/16s → 20/18/16/14s\nTristana To ensure she is compensated relentlessly while jumping in, her mana is offered a small buff and (2) rocket jump. Base Stats\nBase mana per level: 33 → 41 Mana @ level 15: 762 → 874\n(W) Rocket Jump – Slow duration\n1/1.5/2/2.5s → 1.5/2/2.5/3s\nYasuo Riot is withdrawing a significant portion of his base armor and health to enable his enemies to leverage on his weaknesses more effectively. They’re also tweaking his dash speed to balance his League PC pace. This is due to the fact that he has already earned most from the Blade of the Ruined King updates in the most recent patch, 2.1, and enjoys high defense stats owing to his passive shield and mobility. Base Stats\nBase armor: 40 → 35 Base health: 650 → 570\n(E) Sweeping Blade – Dash Speed\n1200 + Movement Speed → 900 + Movement Speed\nZiggs Ziggs gets a small area of effect buff because his Mega Inferno Bomb can be difficult to target at times, particularly when flying around the map. Riot is pulling back on his (W) Satchel Charge implementation as he knocks down turrets pretty quickly. (W) Satchel Charge – Tower destroy threshold\n25/30/35/40% tower HP → 20/25/30/35% tower HP\n(R) Mega Inferno Bomb\nOuter AoE size radius: 4 → 5 Inner AoE size radius: 2 → 2.5\nItem Updates – Locket Enchant Similar to champions, there are some changes made to the locket enchant in Wild Rift 2.1b yama notlari (patch notes). Since the locket is extremely powerful as a first product and nullifies the effectiveness of early game team battle, the developers are making a substantial cut to its early strength and price to discourage it from being obtained too fast. Locket Enchant\nPrice: 500g → 800g Shield Amount: 140 to 420 (120 + Level × 20) → 70 to 420 (45 + Level × 25)\nRune Updates – Conqueror Riot discovered that Conqueror outperforms other options on ranged AP Wild Rift champions after analyzing user data. Aside from that, they believe it is marginally powerful in general for other ranged champions, so they decided to selectively nerf its overall performance on ranged champions by a tiny proportion.\nAP per stack: 4 to 12 (based on champ level) → 3 to 9 (based on champ level) Maximum stack Adaptive Damage bonus: 10% on ranged champions → 7% on ranged champions\nSystems Apart from making changes to the champions and items, Riots also implemented some system changes with the new Wild Rift 2.1b yama notlari (patch notes). The changes are made to the following systems.\nBackdoor Bonus While the developers agree that backdooring is most feasible in some instances, they also voiced concerns that late-game backdooring has become too convenient. As a result, they eliminated the features in the game that decreases the turret defense backdoor bonus.\n“Backdoor bonus” tower damage lessens: 66%, then 33% at 18 minutes → 66% during the entire game\nLane Swaps The developers claim that the excessive lane switches in Wild Rift to compel 2v1 lanes in competitive play is an unhealthy game flow. As a response, in order to retain simple transitions of the game, they are offering turrets more defensive strength if a whole team attempts to take them down, making the laning last at least several minutes in the early part of the game. Before patch 2.1b\nDuring the first 3 minutes, every outer turrets receive 50 bonus Armor/Magic Resist During the first 3 minutes, turrets receive extra defensive bonuses when multiple enemies are nearby: 3 champions in total: 40 Armor/Magic Resist 4 champions in total: 80 Armor/Magic Resist 5 champions in total: 120 Armor/Magic Resist\nAfter Patch 2.1b changes\nDuring the first 3 minutes: Solo (Baron) lane outer turret receives 90 bonus Armor/Magic Resist Mid lane outer turret receives 90 bonus Armor/Magic Resist Duo (Dragon) lane outer turret receives 40 bonus Armor/Magic Resist\nDuring the first 3 minutes, turrets receive extra defensive bonuses when multiple enemies are nearby: 2 champions in total: 10 Armor/Magic Resist 3 champions in total: 100 Armor/Magic Resist 4 champions in total: 200 Armor/Magic Resist 5 champions in total: 300 Armor/Magic Resist\nChat Detection A player may encounter other players who have received text or speech constraints with the incorporation of enhanced Wild Rift chat evaluation in 2.1b yama notlari (patch notes), which amps up to identify the maximum of detected languages. The developers will continue to strengthen both the detection and the languages that Wild Rift supports in the following days.\nFree-To-Play Champion Rotation The free-to-play champion rotation is implemented something like this:\nMar 18 – Mar 24: Corki, Darius, Graves, Katarina, Malphite, Nami, Shyvana, Soraka, Varus, Ziggs Mar 25 – Mar 31: Akali, Draven, Jarvan IV, Jax, Rakan, Sona, Wukong, Xayah, Xin Zhao, Ze\nThat’s all gamers!

Aside from that, they believe it is marginally powerful in general for other ranged champions, so they decided to selectively nerf its overall performance on ranged champions by a tiny proportion.</p><p>AP per stack: 4 to 12 (based on champ level) → 3 to 9 (based on champ level) Maximum stack Adaptive Damage bonus: 10% on ranged champions → 7% on ranged champions</p><h3 id=systems>Systems<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#systems>#</a></h3><p>Apart from making changes to the champions and items, Riots also implemented some system changes with the new Wild Rift 2.1b yama notlari (patch notes). The changes are made to the following systems.</p><h4 id=backdoor-bonus>Backdoor Bonus<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#backdoor-bonus>#</a></h4><p>While the developers agree that backdooring is most feasible in some instances, they also voiced concerns that late-game backdooring has become too convenient. As a result, they eliminated the features in the game that decreases the turret defense backdoor bonus.</p><p>“Backdoor bonus” tower damage lessens: 66%, then 33% at 18 minutes → 66% during the entire game</p><h4 id=lane-swaps>Lane Swaps<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#lane-swaps>#</a></h4><p>The developers claim that the excessive lane switches in Wild Rift to compel 2v1 lanes in competitive play is an unhealthy game flow. As a response, in order to retain simple transitions of the game, they are offering turrets more defensive strength if a whole team attempts to take them down, making the laning last at least several minutes in the early part of the game.

The developers will continue to strengthen both the detection and the languages that Wild Rift supports in the following days.</p><h3 id=free-to-play-champion-rotation>Free-To-Play Champion Rotation<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#free-to-play-champion-rotation>#</a></h3><p>The free-to-play champion rotation is implemented something like this:</p><p>Mar 18 – Mar 24: Corki, Darius, Graves, Katarina, Malphite, Nami, Shyvana, Soraka, Varus, Ziggs Mar 25 – Mar 31: Akali, Draven, Jarvan IV, Jax, Rakan, Sona, Wukong, Xayah, Xin Zhao, Ze</p><p>That’s all gamers!
