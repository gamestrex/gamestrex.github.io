To join the conversation, please email [email protected] Please stop I would like to give an opinion about the NFTs, and say that I’m glad that most people, including GC, aren’t against them. It seems like a bad joke. I have to remember that people spend millions of dollars on the whole thing. Many people ask why, but simple answers are greed and stupidity. They think they will be worth more in a short time, if they sell them to anyone else, and stupidity when they don’t realise that a traditional pyramid scheme is complete without the fact that it’s completely impossible to come out on top after a short while. That all the same, the entire thing, is a scam, and those involved in it should examine themselves. And this is before taking into account the environmental issues and concerns, that people use the money to launder. It could be worse, until you realize that when it comes to games, its everything just in line with a single number written on your armour. It’s completely madness and I hope it’s all gone quickly. Great British GamingVery said to hear about the death of Psygnosis Ian Hetherington, a guy I’d actually heard of despite having been direct into the company’s creation. Everyone seems to have very good time to say about him. The out of Psygnosis, particularly in the PlayStation 1 era, speaks for itself. I can’t do but wish that he hadn’t sold Sony’s business as a way of seeing a great deal of chance they’d not only be going now but even evolved into a major publisher. I’m always upset that the UK lacks some publishers nowadays and with barely any well-known developers. I was so upset when Codemasters left their doors and sold to EA. If only more people had shown a spirit of entrepreneurial genius of Mr. Hetherington, we could be looking at a completely different gaming landscape today. Rest in peace.Beanshee! Definitive EvilSo everybody and everywhere seems that Evil 4 on Quest 2 is truly an instant flop. The narcotics are not so easily retrieved. I don’t like the game, but I’ll likely get on with the plunge eventually. Despite that, I haven’t played the full screen version yet. I bought a copy of a game I bought a few weeks ago and so I was grateful to GC and countless fans. Having read the game’s first book, I was convinced that I had to listen. Should I wait for the VR version to go into the legendary Resident Evil 4 as it is now the definitive way? Why can I take the flat screen if I try to get the original experience, and then give it a sigh of relief when they replay the world through Quest 2. GC: You should use the non-VR version first. You cannot experience Resident Evil 4 if you don’t play them multiple times in a completely different format. In any case, didn’t know that we would describe the VR version as definitive. This would probably be the Wii version, or arguably the original GameCube version. E-mail me your comments to [email protected] The fundamentals of the world of id rather Ubisoft had reconstructed Chaos Theory, but now it begins with Splinter Cell is, like the GC said, a good idea. I don’t trust they won’t dumb it down into straight action, but I’m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and see what they came up with. The graphics, so I hope, are good, as I think people forget what’s called the original Splinter Cell a little back in the day. Exactly the game that convinced me to buy an Xbox, and I didn’t regret it. I understand stealth technology isnt very popular nowadays, but if Splinter Cell isn’t stealthy it’s not worth doing anymore. Which is probably why we don’t have one for so long. Trust issuesSo, like this CD project, can’t give legal worries and can pretend that Cyberpunk 2077 is a deprecated masterpiece and the bugs were never so bad people made out? That’s what they are doing, but I think people have shorter memories than they think. I know often gamers just seem to roll over and ignore trust abuses like this but that usually occurs only in companies that get very much done and you can forgive them because the next version is good, but I don’t see it happening with CD Projekt. When we get the next version of The Witcher 3, they’ll try, but I’m not sure they don’t get the money anymore. The question of whether Zelda: Breath Of The Wild two will be out is all fine and good but personally im a lot more interested in knowing where Metroid Prime 4 is. The company announced that it was restarting in January 2019 and consequently has almost three years in development. It’s a long time since I heard absolutely nothing. The rule is four to five years for a AAA game. In theory, it could come out next Christmas and that would be perfectly fine, but for now it does no sense that this is the plan. Even though they restarted everything, and the first year was just hammering things on paper, that’s a matter of two years. They could put together something they could show people. Perhaps I am the only person with right to win, but that makes it kind of nice to have something to look forward to. So like the guy that wrote to ask what he asked about an OLED model switch (who totally should) for a question on the model switch, it’s pretty sad to know that there’sn’t anything on the Switches release date. In the end, I would happily make a trailer for CGI.Korbie is happy to be a CGI developer. Mining for funI really don’t get people like this data-mining team to make the entire Elden Ring more interesting, and possibly more powerful, months before it comes out. Is it just a bagging right for them, they hacked the game, or does it more fun for them to listen to random dialogue snippets and try to get the story together from that? It seems to me that it doesn’t do anything fun, but punishment. Each other’s own rules are different but at least they’re just keeping it with themselves. It’s only a few moments after my rumor that Microsoft have said Xbox One has become into news. Even if the auction is a one-off and does allow the winner to become a NPC, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a lot of people getting there and all of the money involved. It has been very much changed since I wore Space Invaders on the Atari 2600 for the first time. I’ve always been somewhat sick of pretty graphics. I’m more than happy with what have been the change of the game’s course of the year. I would never ever imagine my 10-year-old self in my wildest dreams at a point. I do not want this to be as bad as it sounds. And its gonna be a little strange for all of the games. Once the developer and the publisher see people going for it, I have no doubt that anyone wants to accept it. They would have an unfair advantage of what they do for the chance to earn substantial profits. I can make all the time money in our hobby but if NFTs become integral to the games I would rather not play anymore, it wouldn’t be like it’d be the end of the world if it had come to that. I’ve quit two long-term relationships that have made me so much more valuable than my video game hobby. So when it comes to not playing games, it’s not my only interest i can think of.MitchellPS: I know its early but I will want to wish all the users of the comments section a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
