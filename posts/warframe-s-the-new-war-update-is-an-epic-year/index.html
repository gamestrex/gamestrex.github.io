It seems like Warframe was just yesterday so oddly free to play game with space ninjas. Now it’s a sci-fi epic complex with all the requisite equipment, from open world mech battles to ship-to-ship space combat. The update on Warframe, The New War, isn’t just a waste of extra content; it is intended to block up a service game treadmill with new chores to grind. It’s a huge story campaign: one of the latest chapters of a lavish saga about the Solar System protecting Tenno, and the return of an old enemy. It’s been a long time. “The New War has been the first major vision of years,” says Rebecca Ford, live operations and community director. Rebecca has been working with Digital Extremes for nine years. She has helped the builder and the dictator of his story with managing his community. She’s the vocal of Lotus, the player’s guide and mentor. I think no matter what happened in 2018, I have no idea that somebody isn’t thinking about it, and how to make it amazing, start testing, build assets, the concepts, it reflects everything. For anyone who’s playing Warframe, it isn’t uncommon for the character of its story but The New War keeps moving toward the core. “Last year we opened the world Heart of Deimos, but with a story quest, the story moved along with story-seeking players were quite happy, but that’s different from what It was The New War. It’s completely cinematic about your relationship with the main character of the game. It’s the kind of content Digital Extremes get excited to share. “For us, this is the most personal content we create, that is why we consider it our banner type. We invested so much in them. It’s really a singleplayer campaign, doesn’t it? You can see how devs react when players reach point of view of God of War or even those special experiences. This is our case.” This is the longest campaign they’ve ever done. “It’s definitely shorter than ever we’ve done.” The players should dare to brace themselves. The New War will take several hours. This will not happen because your normal Warframe activity is not available. The New War, however, has a larger scope than ever. As new big bads come into the solar system, players will be stepping outside their Tenno shoes and taking control of your character.\nMagnum corpus For the player, Seeing the universe by the eyes of the old saw and the old way, the cannon star should make it new sense of scale. With properties like Dune ascendant, Warframe feels decisive to capitalize on an audience eager for dense, political world building and strange science fiction concepts. Though the story is a dark, dramatic beat, Warframe isn’t afraid to have fun. The cloned foot soldier of the Grineer army, controlless and in his hands, remanded by a comically over the top drill sergeant type officer and the weak, robotic, controlling lad in the hyper capitalist Corpus faction, follows the instructions of a flippant, self-centered corporate overlord, whose disregard is too much to be nothing more than laughable. The degree of personality explains that Warframe can’t get any self-settled sci-fi movie, as it’s obsessed with itself. The new war has already begun, but the silliest characters make the game so popular. Though don’t expect to spend all the New War in these shoes. “You will definitely need to choose a Warframe for your enemy and your operator for the main playable quest. We’re at war and we’re trying to act one of The New War, which is what we showed at TennoCon, and shows what the system knows as to the war and then it will become a personal story.” With the investment in its twists and turns (the quests preceding the New War left players with many personal stakes) this new campaign will become a very emotional chapter. I think that story will leave people feeling for me, but I didn’t finish the script without crying. We’re doing something very personal. That quest is as planned. It sounds good for those already enthralled but what about those who have never even tried Warframe? There’s a chance, it may be the best time to get in the seat, as Digital Extremes recently released the new update on board. The goal is to make people’s journey from starting the game to going to The New War a little bit less grindy.” While it’s not easy to rebalance the game’s early portion, some aspects weren’t so difficult to implement. “Fortunately there are many easy ways to do that without spending much time in order to save the money.” All the while, shows that Digital Extremes cares for the community, is the responsibility it has in the big part, but hasn’t always been easy, especially during the global pandemic where the game becomes a lifeline of a certain crowd. It’s been sooooo scary. I have chosen a game, and I have become my digital therapist for working with lockdown. I know Warframe has become that much of a people. Each one has its own series of issues to be explored, because there is no real agreement, and it’s just a quick attempt at a way that doesn’t make it a bad year for everyone. So what is the best approach? “We try not to get things worse than we do to make people’s day out by doing something a net negative.” Occasionally this is a nerf, isn’t it? I’m not saying the design philosophy is to nerf during lockdown because people are depressed, but it’s not a mutually exclusive concept. You have to understand how the player base is invested in the world you built and a big concern for us is what its challenges are, because we had to have some problems, and a lot of time ago, to publish the latest version of the pandemic, or maybe we nerfed, but we just approached the world to re-communise the truth over all of our decisions to alleviate any misunderstandings.”\nAll are running together. New War’s arrival represents more than a new story to tell. For the team, it’s the fruit of a very difficult few years. “We remained together once in the past year, and that was for TennoCon, all inclusive of the developer stream crew. So when it comes to work, it was it, and we’re now all remotely again. I wish I were together because I think it would change the sense that we were actually doing this, this is the year, it’s the time. But we’re making it work distant. There are more challenges, that’s the point of being truth, but we can get back to those challenges.” For Rebecca The New War is more than just the next update. “This quest is like Half Life 3 of Warframe. We’ve been talking about it for the last ten days, and it’s finally here. I am so proud of it because of all the hardships I hope someone will find it worth it. More than anything I hope people realize the next year of Warframe is all about what happens after the new war.” What is coming tomorrow in Warframe? What happened to the elusive Duviri Paradox, which was teased back in 2019? It’s what we have never seen. Fans should wait to hear the information about when to set their expectations accordingly. The truth is, now we are going to make A New War! Our next update will be that. There are quite interesting things going on. I won’t say that it’s directly connected, as The New War is its own thing. One or two players saw some connections in the trailer at TennoCon. In one of TennoCon videos, there was an interesting horse. That world is always connected to me. I’ll keep it a secret that, when the new war opens tomorrow, you will want to find that connection.\n","wordCount":"1344","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-08T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-08T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mary Parsons"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/warframe-s-the-new-war-update-is-an-epic-year/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Warframe S The New War Update Is An Epic Year</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-08 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 8, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1344 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Mary Parsons</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#magnum-corpus>Magnum corpus</a></li><li><a href=#all-are-running-together>All are running together.</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>(Image credits: Digital Extremes)
