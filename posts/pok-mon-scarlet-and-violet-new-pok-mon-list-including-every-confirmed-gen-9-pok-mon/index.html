So far, we’ve seen a handful of new Pokémon coming to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, ranging from towering legendaries to humble starters. This Pokémon Scarlet and Violet new Pokemon list collects every confirmed Pokémon announced for the game. We won’t be covering leaks, so this information is up to date with the latest announcements from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company.\nPokémon Scarlet and Violet new Pokémon list Below you’ll find every new Pokémon that has been officially announced for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. We’ll add more as new annoucements are made, so you get the best idea of what new Gen 9 Pokémon are awaiting you in the Paldea region.\nSprigatito Type - Grass Category - Grass Cat Pokémon Height - 0.4 m Weight - 4.1 kg Ability - Overgrow\nSprigatito is the grass-type starter for Pokémon Scarlet and Voilet and, thanks to the Overgrow ability, its grass-type moves will become more powerful when it has low HP. The official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website describes Sprigatito as, ‘The capricious, attention-seeking Grass Cat Pokémon.’\nFuecoco Type - Fire Category - Fire Croc Pokémon Height - 0.4 m Weight - 9.8 kg Ability - Blaze\nFuecoco is the fire-type starter for Gen 9 and the Blaze ability will increase the power of its fire-type moves when this Pokémon has low HP. Fuecoco is described as ‘The laid-back Fire Croc Pokémon that does things at its own pace’ on the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website.\nQuaxly Type - Water Category - Duckling Pokémon Height - 0.5 m Weight - 6.1 kg Ability - Torrent\nQuaxly is the water-type starter Pokémon for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Due to the Torrent ability, the power of Quaxly’s water-type moves will be increased when it’s HP is low. On the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, Quaxly is described as ‘The earnest and tidy Duckling Pokémon.’\nLechonk Type - Normal Category - Hog Pokémon Height - 0.5 m Weight - 10.2 kg Ability - Glutton/Aroma Veil\nOn the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, Lechonk is described as follows ‘Lechonk uses its sense of smell to find and eat only the most fragrant wild grasses and the richest Berries. As a result of its dining habits, it has come to radiate an aroma resembling herbs that bug Pokémon dislike.’\nSmoliv Type - Normal/Grass Category - Olive Pokémon Height - 0.3 m Weight - 6.5 kg Ability - Early Bird\nOn the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, Smoliv is described as follows ‘The oil that comes out of its head has a very strong bitter taste, and it is not suitable for consumption. When startled or attacked, Smoliv will shoot this oil out, slowing its opponent down. It will then seize that moment to run away.’\nPawmi Type - Electric Category - Mouse Pokémon Height - 0.3 m Weight - 2.5 kg Ability - Static/Natural Cure\nOn the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, Pawmi is described as follows ‘Not only is the fur that covers its body good insulation against the cold, but it also serves the purpose of storing electricity. When it feels uneasy, this cautious Pokémon will begin rubbing its cheeks, preparing itself to discharge an electric shock.’\nCetitan Type - Ice Category - Terra Whale Pokémon Height - 4.5 m Weight - 700 kg Ability - Thick Fat / Slush Rush\nThe official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website describes Cetitan as needing to have tough muscles to ‘support their immense bodies, and physical attacks using their bodies have incredible power.’ It also migrates around the snowy regions of Paldea and is ‘protected by a thick layer of subcutaneous fat.’ Cetitan also has five horns, with the official website noting that ’the horn on the upper jaw is able to gather ice energy, making the surrounding temperature extremely low and freezing the area around the Pokémon.’\nFidough Type - Fairy Category - Puppy Pokémon Height - 0.3 m Weight - 10.9 kg Ability - Own Tempo\nOn the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, Fidough is described as having ‘moist, smooth skin’ which has ’elastic qualities and is both firm and soft at the same time.’ This skin allows Fidough to intimidate its enemies by ‘puffing up their bodies to appear bigger.’ The website continues to explain that ‘Fidough ferments things in its vicinity using the yeast in its breath. Said yeast is useful for cooking, so this Pokémon has been protected by people since long ago.’ Really sounds like we’ve got a dough dog on our hands…\nGrafaiai Type - Poison / Normal Category - Toxic Monkey Pokémon Height - 0.7 m Weight - 27.2 kg Ability - Unburden / Poison Touch\nThe official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website describes Grafaiai as a ‘moody Pokémon’ who prefers to ‘roam alone’ and is ‘constantly caught up in territorial struggles with other Pokémon.’ The paint seen in Grafaiai’s reveal trailer is actually posionous saliva, which ‘paralyzes Bug Pokémon’ that ‘are drawn to the salvia’s sweet, fragrant scent.’ Once these Pokémon have been, the official website claims Grafaiai collect them, which sounds an awful lot like eatting them to me.\nCyclizar Type - Dragon / Normal Category - Mount Pokémon Height - 1.6 m Weight - 63 kg Ability - Shed Skin\nThe official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website reveals that Cyclizar have ’lived in many households in the Paldea region since ancient times’ and that seeing people riding Cylizar is a ‘very common sight’ in the region. Thankfully, it seems like ‘Cyclizar don’t mind being ridden because the warmth of a rider helps stave off the cold.’ Clyclizar can also use the new move Shed Tail, which allows this Pokémon to use its HP to create a substitute before switching places with another Pokémon in your party. Interestingly, Cyclizar resembles the legendary Pokémon Koraidon and Miraidon…\nKlawf Type - Rock Category - Ambush Pokémon Height - 1.3 m Weight - 79 kg Ability - Anger Shell / Shell Armor\nKlawf is a crab who enjoys climbing onto cliffs so it can ambush its prey. According to the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, Klawf ’eventually gets dizzy from the blood rushing to its head’ when hanging upside down on cliffs, so it doesn’t stay in this position for long. Avoiding Klawf’s claws is a must, because, once caught, this Pokémon’s prey can not escape its grasp. Klawf ‘uses one claw to hold its opponent in place while using the other to break its guard and hit it where it hurts.’ These claws are also considered a valuable cooking ingredient in the Paldea region - maybe they go well with a side of Slowpoke tails? The Anger Shell is a new Ability to the Pokémon series where, when Pokémon’s HP drops to half or less, it becomes angry. In this state, the Pokémon’s Defense and Special Defense are lowered, but its Attack, Special Attack and Attack recieve a boost.\nArmarouge Type - Fire / Psychic Category - Fire Warrior Pokémon Height - 1.5 m Weight - 85 kg Ability - Flash Fire\nArmarouge will be exclusive to Pokémon Scarlet. According to the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, Armarouge’s armor once ‘belonged to a distinguised warrior, and is the source of the energy used for its Psychic-type moves’ and it ‘uses the psychic capabilities of this armor to control the fire energy within its body and unleash attacks. This is a Pokémon who believes in a fair fight and will take on any challenger no matter how powerful they are. Armarouge can learn the move, Armor Cannon. This attack may lower its Defense and Special Defense, but its also one of the most powerful moves Armarouge can learn, so, if you want this Pokémon in your team, its worth using.\nCeruledge Type - Fire / Ghost Category - Fire Blades Pokémon Height - 1.6 m Weight - 62 kg Ability - Flash Fire\nCeruledge will be exclusive to Pokémon Violet. The official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website describes Ceruledge as wearing ‘an old set of armor steeped in grudges and wields blades made of fire and ghost energy.’ Due to these blades, Ceruledge prefers close-quarters combat and will do anything, including sneak attacks, to win a battle. You’ll want to avoid those blades too, because your life energy will flow from any cut they leave. Ceruledge can learn the move, Bitter Blade. This attack absorbs the HP of Ceruledge’s foe - restoring up to half the damage taken by the opponent.\nWiglett Type - Water Category - Garden Eel Pokémon Height - 1.2 m Weight - 1.8 kg Ability - Gooey / Rattled\nWiglett, despite its appearance and name, is not related to Diglett. Appartently it’s all one big conincidence, which, if you ask me, sounds a little suspicious. Putting my personal Pokémon conspiracy theories aside, you can find Wiglett on the beaches of the Paldea region. There it burrows through the sand and emerges to feed in the ocean. Wiglett is known for having an amazing sense of smell, being able to pick up scents from over 60 feet away according to the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, and, when it sniffs out another Pokémon, it hides beneath the sand. What no-one knows, however, is how long a Wiglett actually is and what the rest of its body looks like…\nFarigiraf Type - Normal / Psychic Category - Long Neck Pokémon Height - 3.2 m Weight - 160 kg Ability - Cud Chew / Armor Tail\nFarigiraf is the evolved form of the wonderful Girafarig from Gen 2. If you haven’t noticed already, this Pokémon is inspired by giraffes and, as part of the evolution process, Girafarig’s sentient tail has merged with Farigiraf’s neck. According to the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, this has connected both of Farigiraf’s brains ’through thick nerves, increasing its psychic energy, and it can emit psychic waves from the antennae on its head.’ Farigiraf also brings two new abilties to the series - Armor Tail and Cud Chew. Armor Tail prevents opposing Pokémon from using priority moves, while Cud Chew allows Pokémon holding a Berry to eat it at the beginning and ending of a turn, which means you receive its effects twice.\nBellibolt Type - Electric Category - EleFrog Pokémon Height - 1.2 m Weight - 113 kg Ability - Electromorphosis / Static\nIono - the electric-type Gym Leader of the Paldea region - introduced us to Bellibolt during one of her live streams. According to the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, Bellibolt ’expands and contracs its elastic body to generate electricity in an organ that looks like a belly button.’ This electricity is then ‘discharged from the two bumps on eiher side of its head that resemble eyeballs.’ Its eyes are, in fact, the yellow ovals above its mouth! Finally, Bellibolt brings a new ability to the Pokémon series - Electromorphosis. This ability causes Bellibolt to become charged when hit by an enemy attack, which, in turn, boosts the power of the next electric-type move it uses. Our Pokémon Scarlet and Violet walkthrough can take you through the entire game - including The First Day of School, Victory Road, Starfall Street, Path of Legends and when you’re ready, The Way Home and the final boss.\rElsewhere, we can help with the Normal Gym test Secret Item menu, version differences, the best Scarlet and Violet starter, EXP farming, shiny Pokémon and learning how to fly, swim, climb and dash.\rWhen it comes to individual Pokémon, we can help with Gimmighoul, Ditto, Bellibolt, Pawmot, Scovillain, Frigibax, Sinistea, Brambleghast, Annihilape, Farigiraf, Dudunsparce, Lycanrock forms, Armarouge and Ceruledge.\nGreavard Type - Ghost Category - Ghost Dog Pokémon Height - 0.6 m Weight - 35 kg Ability - Pickup\nGreavard is a good boy from the great beyond! According to the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, Greavard, like good dogs, has ‘such a friendly and affectionate personality that paying it even the slightest bit of attention will make it so overjoyed that it will follow you wherever you go.’ Sadly, ‘Greavard will slowly and inadvertently absorb the life-force of those around it, so it’s best not to play with it too much.’ The candle atop Greavard’s head brings Litwick to mind and this little light can be seen on the surface when Greavard sleeps beneath the ground - quite fitting for a ghost-type who’s name resembles graveyard.\nGimmighoul Type - Ghost Category - Coin Chest Pokémon Height - 0.3 m Weight - 5 kg Ability - Rattled\nGimmighoul has two forms - Chest Form and Roaming Form. Chest Form Gimmighoul’s can be found living in a chest full of coins. According to the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, while this chest ‘provides them with a solid defense,’ its weight ‘causes Gimmighoul to move slowly.’ Due to this these Gimmighoul’s are often ‘mistake for an anitque and taken home or sold to an antique store.’ Chest Form Gimmighoul can, however, use this to their advantage by using their ‘ghost energy to control its target, forcing them to collect coins.’ Since it hides in locations which don’t see many visitors, Chest Form Gimmighoul’s are able to ‘keep persistent control of those it does manage to encounter.’ Meanwhile, Roaming Form Gimmighoul choose to carry a single coin on their back and can be encountered across the Paldea region. Despite this, no trainer has suceed in catching one, because the Roaming Form Gimmighoul’s ‘run away as soon as a person approachs.’ Roaming Form Gimmighouls have, however, been spotted in Pokémon Go when, on Saturday, 5th November, a number of PokéStops turned gold. When spun, trainers had the chance of collecting a Strange Coin and, after doing so, a Roaming Form Gimmighoul started following them around. This event was actually Gimmighoul’s first appearance in the Pokémon universe!\nKoraidon and Miraidon Koraidon and Miradion are the two main Legendary Pokémon for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, along with being the mascot Pokémon for the games - Koraidon for Scarlet and Miraidon for Violet. When first revealed, The Pokémon Company stated that, ‘These two Pokémon are said to have powers that far surpass those of other Pokémon, but details about Koraidon and Miraidon are still shrouded in mystery.’ While we don’t know the typing for either Pokémon, we do know that either Koraidon or Miradion will be present in your journey from early on and act as a form of transporation. (Yes - if you chose to play Pokémon Violet, you will be using a legendary Pokémon as a motorcycle.) At the time of writing, three different forms of legendary transportation have been revealed - with Koraidon’s version being referred to as ‘Build’ and Miradion’s as ‘Mode’:\nSprinting Build or Drive Mode - allows you to travel across Paldea at a faster speed. (Goodbye bicyle!) Swimming Build or Aquatic Mode - traverse any body of water you encounter. Gliding Build or Glide Mode - fly through the sky on the back of a legend!\nAt the time of writing, we don’t know if there will be any requirement tied to these forms of transporation. That’s every new Pokémon currently announced for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet! For more on the game be sure to check out our deep dive on the three new starter Pokémon, Koraidon and Miraidon and, finally, Paldean Pokémon, including Paldean Wooper.\n","wordCount":"2584","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-14T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-14T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kathryn Yang"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/pok-mon-scarlet-and-violet-new-pok-mon-list-including-every-confirmed-gen-9-pok-mon/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Pok Mon Scarlet And Violet New Pok Mon List Including Every Confirmed Gen 9 Pok Mon</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 14, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2584 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Kathryn Yang</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#pokémon-scarlet-and-violet-new-pokémon-list>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet new Pokémon list</a><ul><li><a href=#sprigatito>Sprigatito</a></li><li><a href=#fuecoco>Fuecoco</a></li><li><a href=#quaxly>Quaxly</a></li><li><a href=#lechonk>Lechonk</a></li><li><a href=#smoliv>Smoliv</a></li><li><a href=#pawmi>Pawmi</a></li><li><a href=#cetitan>Cetitan</a></li><li><a href=#fidough>Fidough</a></li><li><a href=#grafaiai>Grafaiai</a></li><li><a href=#cyclizar>Cyclizar</a></li><li><a href=#klawf>Klawf</a></li><li><a href=#armarouge>Armarouge</a></li><li><a href=#ceruledge>Ceruledge</a></li><li><a href=#wiglett>Wiglett</a></li><li><a href=#farigiraf>Farigiraf</a></li><li><a href=#bellibolt>Bellibolt</a></li><li><a href=#greavard>Greavard</a></li><li><a href=#gimmighoul>Gimmighoul</a></li><li><a href=#koraidon-and-miraidon>Koraidon and Miraidon</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>The game was surprise announced earlier this year, showing players a glimpse of the new world, and the Gen 9 Pokémon that live there.

When it feels uneasy, this cautious Pokémon will begin rubbing its cheeks, preparing itself to discharge an electric shock.&rsquo;</p><h3 id=cetitan>Cetitan<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cetitan>#</a></h3><p>Type - Ice Category - Terra Whale Pokémon Height - 4.5 m Weight - 700 kg Ability - Thick Fat / Slush Rush</p><p>The official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website describes Cetitan as needing to have tough muscles to &lsquo;support their immense bodies, and physical attacks using their bodies have incredible power.&rsquo; It also migrates around the snowy regions of Paldea and is &lsquo;protected by a thick layer of subcutaneous fat.&rsquo;
Cetitan also has five horns, with the official website noting that &rsquo;the horn on the upper jaw is able to gather ice energy, making the surrounding temperature extremely low and freezing the area around the Pokémon.&rsquo;</p><h3 id=fidough>Fidough<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#fidough>#</a></h3><p>Type - Fairy Category - Puppy Pokémon Height - 0.3 m Weight - 10.9 kg Ability - Own Tempo</p><p>On the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, Fidough is described as having &lsquo;moist, smooth skin&rsquo; which has &rsquo;elastic qualities and is both firm and soft at the same time.&rsquo; This skin allows Fidough to intimidate its enemies by &lsquo;puffing up their bodies to appear bigger.&rsquo;
The website continues to explain that &lsquo;Fidough ferments things in its vicinity using the yeast in its breath. Said yeast is useful for cooking, so this Pokémon has been protected by people since long ago.&rsquo;
Really sounds like we&rsquo;ve got a dough dog on our hands&mldr;</p><h3 id=grafaiai>Grafaiai<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#grafaiai>#</a></h3><p>Type - Poison / Normal Category - Toxic Monkey Pokémon Height - 0.7 m Weight - 27.2 kg Ability - Unburden / Poison Touch</p><p>The official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website describes Grafaiai as a &lsquo;moody Pokémon&rsquo; who prefers to &lsquo;roam alone&rsquo; and is &lsquo;constantly caught up in territorial struggles with other Pokémon.&rsquo;
The paint seen in Grafaiai&rsquo;s reveal trailer is actually posionous saliva, which &lsquo;paralyzes Bug Pokémon&rsquo; that &lsquo;are drawn to the salvia&rsquo;s sweet, fragrant scent.&rsquo; Once these Pokémon have been, the official website claims Grafaiai collect them, which sounds an awful lot like eatting them to me.</p><h3 id=cyclizar>Cyclizar<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cyclizar>#</a></h3><p>Type - Dragon / Normal Category - Mount Pokémon Height - 1.6 m Weight - 63 kg Ability - Shed Skin</p><p>The official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website reveals that Cyclizar have &rsquo;lived in many households in the Paldea region since ancient times&rsquo; and that seeing people riding Cylizar is a &lsquo;very common sight&rsquo; in the region. Thankfully, it seems like &lsquo;Cyclizar don&rsquo;t mind being ridden because the warmth of a rider helps stave off the cold.&rsquo;
Clyclizar can also use the new move Shed Tail, which allows this Pokémon to use its HP to create a substitute before switching places with another Pokémon in your party.
Interestingly, Cyclizar resembles the legendary Pokémon Koraidon and Miraidon&mldr;</p><h3 id=klawf>Klawf<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#klawf>#</a></h3><p>Type - Rock Category - Ambush Pokémon Height - 1.3 m Weight - 79 kg Ability - Anger Shell / Shell Armor</p><p>Klawf is a crab who enjoys climbing onto cliffs so it can ambush its prey. According to the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, Klawf &rsquo;eventually gets dizzy from the blood rushing to its head&rsquo; when hanging upside down on cliffs, so it doesn&rsquo;t stay in this position for long.
Avoiding Klawf&rsquo;s claws is a must, because, once caught, this Pokémon&rsquo;s prey can not escape its grasp. Klawf &lsquo;uses one claw to hold its opponent in place while using the other to break its guard and hit it where it hurts.&rsquo; These claws are also considered a valuable cooking ingredient in the Paldea region - maybe they go well with a side of Slowpoke tails?
The Anger Shell is a new Ability to the Pokémon series where, when Pokémon&rsquo;s HP drops to half or less, it becomes angry. In this state, the Pokémon&rsquo;s Defense and Special Defense are lowered, but its Attack, Special Attack and Attack recieve a boost.</p><h3 id=armarouge>Armarouge<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#armarouge>#</a></h3><p>Type - Fire / Psychic Category - Fire Warrior Pokémon Height - 1.5 m Weight - 85 kg Ability - Flash Fire</p><p>Armarouge will be exclusive to Pokémon Scarlet.
According to the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, Armarouge&rsquo;s armor once &lsquo;belonged to a distinguised warrior, and is the source of the energy used for its Psychic-type moves&rsquo; and it &lsquo;uses the psychic capabilities of this armor to control the fire energy within its body and unleash attacks. This is a Pokémon who believes in a fair fight and will take on any challenger no matter how powerful they are.
Armarouge can learn the move, Armor Cannon. This attack may lower its Defense and Special Defense, but its also one of the most powerful moves Armarouge can learn, so, if you want this Pokémon in your team, its worth using.</p><h3 id=ceruledge>Ceruledge<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ceruledge>#</a></h3><p>Type - Fire / Ghost Category - Fire Blades Pokémon Height - 1.6 m Weight - 62 kg Ability - Flash Fire</p><p>Ceruledge will be exclusive to Pokémon Violet.
The official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website describes Ceruledge as wearing &lsquo;an old set of armor steeped in grudges and wields blades made of fire and ghost energy.&rsquo; Due to these blades, Ceruledge prefers close-quarters combat and will do anything, including sneak attacks, to win a battle. You&rsquo;ll want to avoid those blades too, because your life energy will flow from any cut they leave.
Ceruledge can learn the move, Bitter Blade. This attack absorbs the HP of Ceruledge&rsquo;s foe - restoring up to half the damage taken by the opponent.</p><h3 id=wiglett>Wiglett<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#wiglett>#</a></h3><p>Type - Water Category - Garden Eel Pokémon Height - 1.2 m Weight - 1.8 kg Ability - Gooey / Rattled</p><p>Wiglett, despite its appearance and name, is not related to Diglett. Appartently it&rsquo;s all one big conincidence, which, if you ask me, sounds a little suspicious.
Putting my personal Pokémon conspiracy theories aside, you can find Wiglett on the beaches of the Paldea region. There it burrows through the sand and emerges to feed in the ocean. Wiglett is known for having an amazing sense of smell, being able to pick up scents from over 60 feet away according to the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, and, when it sniffs out another Pokémon, it hides beneath the sand.
What no-one knows, however, is how long a Wiglett actually is and what the rest of its body looks like&mldr;</p><h3 id=farigiraf>Farigiraf<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#farigiraf>#</a></h3><p>Type - Normal / Psychic Category - Long Neck Pokémon Height - 3.2 m Weight - 160 kg Ability - Cud Chew / Armor Tail</p><p>Farigiraf is the evolved form of the wonderful Girafarig from Gen 2.
If you haven&rsquo;t noticed already, this Pokémon is inspired by giraffes and, as part of the evolution process, Girafarig&rsquo;s sentient tail has merged with Farigiraf&rsquo;s neck. According to the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, this has connected both of Farigiraf&rsquo;s brains &rsquo;through thick nerves, increasing its psychic energy, and it can emit psychic waves from the antennae on its head.&rsquo;
Farigiraf also brings two new abilties to the series - Armor Tail and Cud Chew. Armor Tail prevents opposing Pokémon from using priority moves, while Cud Chew allows Pokémon holding a Berry to eat it at the beginning and ending of a turn, which means you receive its effects twice.</p><h3 id=bellibolt>Bellibolt<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#bellibolt>#</a></h3><p>Type - Electric Category - EleFrog Pokémon Height - 1.2 m Weight - 113 kg Ability - Electromorphosis / Static</p><p>Iono - the electric-type Gym Leader of the Paldea region - introduced us to Bellibolt during one of her live streams.
According to the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, Bellibolt &rsquo;expands and contracs its elastic body to generate electricity in an organ that looks like a belly button.&rsquo; This electricity is then &lsquo;discharged from the two bumps on eiher side of its head that resemble eyeballs.&rsquo; Its eyes are, in fact, the yellow ovals above its mouth!
Finally, Bellibolt brings a new ability to the Pokémon series - Electromorphosis. This ability causes Bellibolt to become charged when hit by an enemy attack, which, in turn, boosts the power of the next electric-type move it uses.
Our Pokémon Scarlet and Violet walkthrough can take you through the entire game - including The First Day of School, Victory Road, Starfall Street, Path of Legends and when you&rsquo;re ready, The Way Home and the final boss.
Elsewhere, we can help with the Normal Gym test Secret Item menu, version differences, the best Scarlet and Violet starter, EXP farming, shiny Pokémon and learning how to fly, swim, climb and dash.
When it comes to individual Pokémon, we can help with Gimmighoul, Ditto, Bellibolt, Pawmot, Scovillain, Frigibax, Sinistea, Brambleghast, Annihilape, Farigiraf, Dudunsparce, Lycanrock forms, Armarouge and Ceruledge.</p><h3 id=greavard>Greavard<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#greavard>#</a></h3><p>Type - Ghost Category - Ghost Dog Pokémon Height - 0.6 m Weight - 35 kg Ability - Pickup</p><p>Greavard is a good boy from the great beyond!
According to the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, Greavard, like good dogs, has &lsquo;such a friendly and affectionate personality that paying it even the slightest bit of attention will make it so overjoyed that it will follow you wherever you go.&rsquo; Sadly, &lsquo;Greavard will slowly and inadvertently absorb the life-force of those around it, so it&rsquo;s best not to play with it too much.&rsquo;
The candle atop Greavard&rsquo;s head brings Litwick to mind and this little light can be seen on the surface when Greavard sleeps beneath the ground - quite fitting for a ghost-type who&rsquo;s name resembles graveyard.</p><h3 id=gimmighoul>Gimmighoul<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gimmighoul>#</a></h3><p>Type - Ghost Category - Coin Chest Pokémon Height - 0.3 m Weight - 5 kg Ability - Rattled</p><p>Gimmighoul has two forms - Chest Form and Roaming Form.
Chest Form Gimmighoul&rsquo;s can be found living in a chest full of coins. According to the official Pokémon Scarlet and Violet website, while this chest &lsquo;provides them with a solid defense,&rsquo; its weight &lsquo;causes Gimmighoul to move slowly.&rsquo; Due to this these Gimmighoul&rsquo;s are often &lsquo;mistake for an anitque and taken home or sold to an antique store.&rsquo;
Chest Form Gimmighoul can, however, use this to their advantage by using their &lsquo;ghost energy to control its target, forcing them to collect coins.&rsquo; Since it hides in locations which don&rsquo;t see many visitors, Chest Form Gimmighoul&rsquo;s are able to &lsquo;keep persistent control of those it does manage to encounter.&rsquo;
Meanwhile, Roaming Form Gimmighoul choose to carry a single coin on their back and can be encountered across the Paldea region. Despite this, no trainer has suceed in catching one, because the Roaming Form Gimmighoul&rsquo;s &lsquo;run away as soon as a person approachs.&rsquo;
Roaming Form Gimmighouls have, however, been spotted in Pokémon Go when, on Saturday, 5th November, a number of PokéStops turned gold. When spun, trainers had the chance of collecting a Strange Coin and, after doing so, a Roaming Form Gimmighoul started following them around. This event was actually Gimmighoul&rsquo;s first appearance in the Pokémon universe!</p><h3 id=koraidon-and-miraidon>Koraidon and Miraidon<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#koraidon-and-miraidon>#</a></h3><p>Koraidon and Miradion are the two main Legendary Pokémon for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, along with being the mascot Pokémon for the games - Koraidon for Scarlet and Miraidon for Violet.
When first revealed, The Pokémon Company stated that, &lsquo;These two Pokémon are said to have powers that far surpass those of other Pokémon, but details about Koraidon and Miraidon are still shrouded in mystery.&rsquo;
While we don&rsquo;t know the typing for either Pokémon, we do know that either Koraidon or Miradion will be present in your journey from early on and act as a form of transporation. (Yes - if you chose to play Pokémon Violet, you will be using a legendary Pokémon as a motorcycle.)
At the time of writing, three different forms of legendary transportation have been revealed - with Koraidon&rsquo;s version being referred to as &lsquo;Build&rsquo; and Miradion&rsquo;s as &lsquo;Mode&rsquo;:</p><p>Sprinting Build or Drive Mode - allows you to travel across Paldea at a faster speed. (Goodbye bicyle!) Swimming Build or Aquatic Mode - traverse any body of water you encounter. Gliding Build or Glide Mode - fly through the sky on the back of a legend!</p><p>At the time of writing, we don&rsquo;t know if there will be any requirement tied to these forms of transporation.
That&rsquo;s every new Pokémon currently announced for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet! For more on the game be sure to check out our deep dive on the three new starter Pokémon, Koraidon and Miraidon and, finally, Paldean Pokémon, including Paldean Wooper.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Sprigatito-table-image-1.jpeg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Sprigatito-table-image-1.jpeg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Pok mon Scarlet and Violet new Pok mon list  including every confirmed Gen 9 Pok mon -
