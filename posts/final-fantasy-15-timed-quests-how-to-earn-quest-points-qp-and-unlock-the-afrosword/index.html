To start a Timed Quest, load up a save and go to your menu screen, and an option will be present at the bottom. There’ll be a stats screen, where you can see the restrictions, and a bounty reward. Previously, Timed Quests saw you rank you against all other players competing on an hourly, daily and event basis. When you competed in a Timed Quest, your score is submitted to a leaderboard, which is then ranked against other players. Based on your position at the end, you received get different points rewarded; ranking in the top 100 gives you much higher gains than if you were in the top 1,000, for example. Ranking gave you two different types of Quest Points (or QP) and are, rather confusingly, named the exact same. One is for the Prize Exchange store, and the other a time-limited store for that specific event. Though you can still earn Quest Points, there is just a single pool of QP and awards to choose from. Additionally, there is a new event available per day to attempt (which are mostly combat oriented, and designed for end-game players) again, don’t expect any new additions to the roster now the activity is offline-only.\nAfrosword (1000 QP) Wind-up Lord Vexxos (850 QP) AP x300 (700 QP) EXP x50,000 (600 QP) Gil x100,000 (400 QP) Megalixir x5 (105 QP) Mega Phoenix x3 (75 QP) Oracle Ascension Coin x2 (45 QP)\nThat means the Afrosword requires some saving up, but as an item exclusive to this feature (and with an impressive 503 attack) it’s an item that might be worth working toward. If you are curious, the rewards are as follows: Other things to note:\nYou are able to play (fishing or hunting) multiple times within an hour. So, if you are fishing and you land five catches, you can go away, rest and catch another four for a total of nine for that hour, provided you do so within the same slot. When it comes to combat, often leaving the area will reset the encounter. Scores upload and update at the end of every session, but in case it doesn’t (such as a server issue) you can do so manually within the Timed Quests part of the menu. The game says you can register a score “for roughly an hour” after an event ends, giving you some grace period. Don’t switch off the game before then! It seems like both scores and rewards take some time to register, likely due to the above grace period on uploading scores. In our experience on the first day of the Timed Quest, a score can take about 20 minutes to update on the leaderboard, while the rewards given to you from an hourly ranking can take around 3-4 hours to appear. A little frustrating, but be patient! You’ll be notified at the point of connecting to the server (uploading a score, going to the Timed Quests part of the menu) when it’s ready. As well as QP, you earn titles with you rank for the hour, day or event, so you can show off for future leaderboards. Another incentive to get as high as you can!\nHere is an example of the online Timed Quests that was on offer - the first was one of the more unique, a fishing challenge that had you catch as many fish as you can within an hour (starting and ending on the hour): Target: Any fish Restrictions: None Active: Chapter 1 onward Bounty: Prize Exchange (50GP), Event (50GP) Location doesn’t matter; go to a fishing spot of your choice, and provided you’re connected to the internet, you’ll be told your current high score so far within that hour, and your highest score overall. Now try and top it! If you want that elusive Afrosword at a whopping 1,000 QP, you’ll need to be fishing a lot. It’s available in stores for both all Timed Quests and this current Fishing Contest, but rewards come by faster for the latter if you fancy putting some hours in sooner than later. If you’re serious about it, we imagine the following strategy would be best; go all out for an hour a day and get a high score, so that you get a strong hourly and daily (and hopefully, an event-wide) score, and then also play little and and often throughout the day. If you are in a position where you can play for five minutes every hour, then the points will tot up; five of so fish caught should give you enough to rank within the top 2,500 players (and depending on the time of day, and as the event goes on and interest wanes, it could be even higher) to get 10QP for the hour. That’s 100 score submissions in total (10GP per hourly ranking) but remember you should be ranking per day too, giving you a boost. Top rewards available in the store for this event include:\nAfrosword (1000 QP) AP x999 (500 QP) EXP x100,000 (500 QP) Wind-up Lord Vexxos (300 QP) AP x185 (100 QP) EXP x19,000 (100 QP) Gil x200,000 (100 QP) Oracle Ascension Coin x10 (30 QP) Gil x20,000 (10 QP)\nNot an exhaustive list, but something to aim for, and if you don’t make it, as the above tables show, you’ll be earning for the Prize Exchange too, giving you additional chances in future. Need more help? Our Final Fantasy 15 guide and walkthrough can provide tips on main story, as well as the open-world’s many quests and activities. Learning how to get AP fast, EXP fast and money or Gil fast will aid you in many optional dungeons and tombs - including how to open and explore their locked doors. There’s also plenty of interesting side-quests, too, such as the Scraps of Mystery and Professors Protege frog locations. And if you want to get around easier, you can rent a Chocobo, learn the infinite sprint trick and later in the game, get the flying car Regalia Type F. There’s also more to see and do with DLC, such as Episode Gladiolus and Episode Prompto. Some additional general fishing tips we can recommend as well include:\nGet the strongest possible rod and reel possible to help catch fish easier. These are from completing the Navyth questline (starting at the large lake Alsor Slough in Duscae) for rods, and the Totomostro betting mini-game in Altissia for the lure. That said, even beginner rods and lures will do fine, since quantity and not quality of fish is what matters. Increasing Noct’s Fishing Skill will improve his chances of catching all fish, not just larger ones, so hopefully you’ve made some headway into levelling this already. If not, this event should go some way in increasing it!\nGet the right lure for the fish you’re looking to catch. Some fishing spots, such as in Galdin Quay, displays the fish available on a sign next to a shop that sells the corresponding lures, making things clearer; this particular spot is very low level, perfect if you haven’t done much fishing thus far. You can buy Lures from your car, too. If you run out of fish, you can sleep and the fishing spot should respawn its population. Remember you can fish multiple times within an hour, and it’ll all add up to your overall hourly score. Make sure you have enough lines on you before you head to the fishing spot, otherwise you’ll be wasting valuable time going back to a store.
