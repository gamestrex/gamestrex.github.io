There are two endings to discover, with the ‘True Ending’ require a specific set of additional steps in order to complete, not unlike the pre-release demo (though not nearly as convoluted). We recommend playing through the Bad Ending first to get a feel for the general flow of the episode, especially since there are Trophies for both, before jumping into the True Ending. If you’re interested in other Banned Footage DLC, our pages on the Bedroom solution, how to beat Hoffman at Blackjack in 21 and finishing Nightmare mode can help. On this page: If you’re after help for parts of the game, consult our complete Resident Evil 7 walkthrough. Now, play the episode as you would normally. After approaching the bed in the Kid’s Room, press the right trigger / R2 to use your Lighter, and head out of the room. Head downstairs to the Dining Room and check on Lucas, then return upstairs to the Bathroom for a cutscene with Jack and Marguerite. Head to the Garage, grab the Rope as soon as you enter, then back up to the Bathroom again, where Jack will start pursuing you. Sprint down the corridor, into the Recreation Room, and close the door behind you. Use the Rope to lock the door, then head into the side-room (known as Grandma’s Room in the full game) and get the Fork from the table. Use that on the loose nails sticking out of the plank of wood across the window in the north west corner of the main Recreation Room to escape. How evade Marguerite and get the Bad Ending Head east down the passage and pull open the sheet of metal, and wait for Jack to drag Lucas into the Kid’s Room, and head into the Main Hall. Marguerite will be patrolling in the Main Hall, and you must evade her and reach the locked doors on the west side on 1F that leads back to the Dining Room and Garage. Turn the Lighter off with the right trigger / R2 and wait until Margurite is away from that door and looking away - maybe when she’s investigating the south-most alcove, where you find the Shotgun in the main game - then crouch and slowly move your way there. As soon as you unlock it, you’ll get a cutscene and receive the Car Key. Make your way to the Garage along the corridor, but beware Jack will ambush you as soon as you turn the corner by the Laundry Room. Instead, sprint into the Laundry Room, go into the crawl space to arrive into the Pantry. You can collect a Lockpick on the way to open a drawer with a Broken Bottle in the Pantry, which can be used in defence against Jack - but isn’t essential. Now, sneak past Jack, who is patrolling the corridor between the Garage and Laundry Room. If you wait in the Dining Room, along the wall between the two doors, he will walk back and forth. When his back is turned, sneak through to the Garage, and press the button to enter, and approach the car door. Enjoy the ending! After the opening cutscene, stand over Lucas as he sits at the table, and observe his phone screen and remember the pin code he enters - 1019. Next, head to the Laundry Room and grab the Change of Clothes as usual. However, you’ll also want to drop down into the crawl space, where you’ll find a Lockpick at the end, just before the Pantry. You may find it easier to run to the Pantry and drop down - whatever works for you. With the Lockpick in hand, head to 2F, taking the stairs between the Garage and Laundry Room, and into the Bathroom. Use the Lockpick on the locked drawer in here to get the Small Component. Head to the Kid’s Room, and before you hand over the Change of Clothes to Eveline, investigate the trophy on the right as you enter and use the Small Component to access the Attic. Climb up, and investigate the computer on the far wall, and input the pin code Lucas used on his phone earlier - 1019. Read the note, giving you a hint of where to find a key item inside a red toolbox later. This is required to open it; if you don’t read this note, it’ll remain closed. Now, play the episode as you would normally. After approaching the bed in the Kid’s Room, press the right trigger / R2 to use your Lighter, and head out of the room.
