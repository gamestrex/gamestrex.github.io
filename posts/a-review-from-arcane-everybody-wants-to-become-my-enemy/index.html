The fight scenes are all tragic in their own way, the consequences are not in all the way up with retribution. Most of the things you saw coming after Episode 2 are played out, and it still looks bad all the same. I will talk about some of the most important developments within Act 2 of Arcane, and how the powders are used to combat trauma and mental health in the show.\nArcane Episode 3 ties everything together. In my last review, I discussed how Riot did a good job allowing people to reach Arcane, so that we can be more well informed in understanding how all of the actions are impacted. Well, Riot, I asked politely for a second time because I’ve seen something very often. Tell me now if Arcane irass will be like this, because I don’t know how much more devastation I have. First, some housekeeping. Jayces trial ends with a disbanding teacher, but in return he gains a partner for his Hextech dream in Viktor, who also tried to stop Jayce from ending his life. Back in The Lanes, Marcus deal with Silco takes a hard turn when Vander turns himself in to protect Vi. Seeing him and one of his juiced-up thugs get ambushed. A friend of Vanders’s Benzo was killed and Vander gets pushed to the Silcos lab after hitting the top of the head. Everything is done while the Vi and Ekko watch with ease. Episode 3 of Arcane is nonstop, but it doesn’t leave viewers in the dark. That opens up with a scene that gives us a broader insight into the relationship between Vander and Silcos. Now it seems like they fought a long time ago. Silco lost, and was left to fight for his life while drowning. We still don’t know how the two get together, but it’s quite a real sense why Silco would be motivated to jump him. Jayce and Viktor are in business in Topside, and work hard to make their Hextech dream a reality. They want to bring magic into the hands of the people and help make the world better. Viktor says that, and Jayce agrees. Yet after a bit of fanservice for Vayce shippers, they get to the Heimerdingers lab and go on to a major breakthrough in their research. The rest of Arcane Episode 3 centers around Vi, Powder, Mylo and Claggors are trying to save Vander from Silcos clutches. This is where everything is dark. But as I watched, I thought I was ready to go wherever it was possible. My mind was very wrong. Unfortunately, I wasn’t ready. I wasn’t prepared at all.\nVi represents violence. It is time to talk about the incident. When the gang decides on their plan to rescue Vander, they have decided to drop their lives off the line. As long as I’m giving mylo time to open the doors of Vanders and Claggor, a very young Vi is trying to figure out their exit strategy, using a van of massive henchmen in a massive bid. This scene was very bad, but I still don’t think such a young person can take such many people by a day, either. She eventually lost the juiced-up guy (you know, the guy you got from). Vander takes his dramatic entrance after being freed. Basically, Vander is the purple guy, is confronted by Silco, then he takes a serious fight before Silco stabs Vander. Vander takes Silco with his restless breaths even though he’s fine. He falls into the pile of the same potion that has turned many people into muscular freaks. That’s where Powder took control of the story from the scene. Vi told him to stand the dangerous heist off the flame. Since the show has taken place early, and that, for those familiar with League of Legends, Powder’s mental health has problems whose root is her abandonment and anxiety. I don’t think that she caught a lot of glimpses of that before Arcane Episode 3, but when she was in a bedroom, she’s suddenly seeing a psychosis sprain: she was talking to herself, jarring hallucinations and intense agitation manifested by physical destruction. I wondered how Riot would tackle Powders mental health and imminent descent and I think this scene is the best example of the moment of the encounter, as far as I am concerned. Arcane Episode 3 reveals the best of Powders in a real way, and puts viewers well for the huge event and the aftermath of it all. When Powder goes against Vis wishes and shows up to the scene, she intends to help using the power of blue crystals that we’ve seen cause significant destruction throughout the show. Unfortunately, in a telemetry device, she uses that unstable power to generate explosive material costs mylo, Claggor and Vanders lives. Powder is happy to be able to contribute, but when she finally reunites with the vi, who suffered a long injury, reality is in full swing. The fear and the frustration felt in the presence of a fierce and hateful reaction can be backed up by the horror of its own actions. You had it. Vi said. Then both separate, without ever getting to see each other again after Powder is found and taken by Silco and Vi is received from Marcus on her way back to her sister. Arcane Episode 3 lands well and ends Act 1 with no impact. It makes sense that Powder was used under Silcos wing. While this episode went on to be overloaded, a tasteful and satisfying conclusion made even more enjoyable. Act 2 is coming out and who knows where the next chapter of Arcanes will be. 10/10.\n","wordCount":"966","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Stacey Credi"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/a-review-from-arcane-everybody-wants-to-become-my-enemy/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>A Review From Arcane Everybody Wants To Become My Enemy</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-29 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 29, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;966 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Stacey Credi</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#arcane-episode-3-ties-everything-together>Arcane Episode 3 ties everything together.</a></li><li><a href=#vi-represents-violence>Vi represents violence.</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Arcane Episode 3 was the heart-warming finale of the Netflix exclusive animated series first act.
