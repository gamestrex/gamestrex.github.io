Cyberpunk 1.5 patch notes in order: Below you can find the list of the most notable changes coming in this update. Apartments Apartments can be rented (with a one-time fee) when encountered in Night City or through the EZEstates website when accessed through the computer in V’s Megabuilding H10 apartment. They become available after completing the Playing for Time quest. It’s possible to rent all apartments at the same time. All apartments share the same stash. Available apartments:\nNorthside, Watson (€$5,000) Japantown, Westbrook (€$15,000) The Glen, Heywood (€$40,000) Corpo Plaza, City Center (€$55,000)\nAdditionally, you can now customize V’s starting apartment in Megabuilding H10 using the EZEstates website for €$10,000. Change appearance You can now tweak certain features of your appearance (such as hair, makeup, piercing, etc.) when using the mirror in any of your apartments and safehouses. It’s free and you can do it as often as you like. Character customization also includes more makeup and hair color options. Who’s the fairest of them all, now? What’s New at Wilson’s?\nYou can check out new items in Wilson’s 2nd Amendment store in Megabuilding H10 or look for them while exploring Night City. 2 new weapons: Darra Polytechnic Umbra (Power Assault Rifle), Budget Arms Guillotine (Power Submachine Gun) 4 new weapon scopes: Kang Tao Jue long scope, Tsunami Gaki sniper scope, Arasaka Kanetsugu short scope, Handyman short scope New type of weapon attachments - muzzle brakes: 10 new muzzle brakes: 5 for handguns (RC-7 Ifrit, RC-7 Liger, RC-7 Dybbuk, RC-7 Kutrub, RC-7 Babaroga); 5 for assault rifles and submachine guns (RC-7 Aswang, RC-7 Varkolak, RC-7 Zaar, RC-7 Yokai, RC-7 Strigoi).\nNew Poses in Photo Mode We added a number of new poses in Photo Mode, including poses for Johnny Silverhand (only available in flashback scenes when playing as Johnny).\nMultiple fixes and improvements to NPC melee and ranged combat AI and reactions, including taking cover, positioning, reloading, equipping weapons, dodging, blocking and many others. Multiple improvements to dismemberment triggers, hit reactions and death animations, adding greater impact to ranged and melee combat. Enemies are now much better at blocking and evading (Kerenzikov) attacks. The heavier the weapon, the easier it is to hit. The opposite is true for evading. Further diversification of melee and ranged combat behaviors for different factions: reckless, aggressive, balanced, defensive and cautious. Followers now contribute more in combat but can be defeated and temporarily disabled if they receive enough punishment. Numerous fixes and balance changes to netrunner combat.\nCrowd Improvements\nAggressive crowd behavior: certain NPC archetypes can and will enter combat with the player when provoked by aiming, shooting or fighting. Due to some technical challenges, this change is not available on the previous generation of consoles. Time skips affect the state of NPCs, as well as reset the state of the devices, environments and certain scenes. Improved crowd reactions, pathfinding and despawning.\nDrive Model\nIntroducing our all new Burn Out Mode! Hold Gas + Brake to engage, steer to rotate. The old system only allowed rotating on the spot, now try modulating the inputs to see what you can do! Try brake stands, donuts, drifts or heat up the tires to do a drag-race style launch with a High Grip boost. The system now works at higher speeds, so you can hit the brake with gas applied on corner entry to cause oversteer on most cars. Keyboard users can optionally use new Secondary bindings on arrow keys (some keyboards ignore the third key press when just using WASD), but gamepads allow the most control of the system (as gamepads in general provide the driving experience preferred by a vast majority of players). New Braking system produces consistent performance, front to rear, across all speeds. ABS simulation added. All vehicles brakes have been tuned to the new model.\rEngine simulation improved. Clutch simulation added. These changes improve resistance forces from the engine when shifting, helping to remove unwanted wheel spin events. Gearbox simulation improved. Much improved downshifting behavior. Transmission now realistically downshifts and has smarter shift logic to keep the engine in its sweet spot. Forward \u003c-\u003e Reverse shifting has been totally redone, allowing for J-Turns / Rockfords. Motorcycles improved. All of the above improvements help to make them more stable. Additionally, steering model improvements have been added, and they have been retuned. Tune improvements to various cars. Quadra Type-66 (all models, especially Avenger), Mizutani Shion (especially MZ2), Herrera Outlaw (major pass) and base MaiMai all had steering improvements implemented and more. Added adjustments to first-person perspective to all vehicles that needed it. In addition, Nomad vehicles with CrystalDome technology now digitally omit objects obscuring view.\nVehicle Traffic\nVisual improvement to traffic movement: turning and suspension. Panic reaction to danger: traffic now has the ability to drive away in panic from danger. NPC passengers can now die from car crashes. Reactions to fender benders: vehicles now have a wider range of reactions to being bumped into, and will recover and return to traffic more smoothly.\nVarious changes related to the economy, including increased rewards from jobs and Open World activities and decreased prices for vehicles and cyberware. Rebalanced and improved functionality of clothing mods. Adjusted the amount of modification slots available on clothing items. Categorized the mods to fit only specific clothing items. As a result, all equipped mods were moved back to your inventory. Go to the Inventory screen to re-equip them in accordance with the new rules. The “Easy” game difficulty is now moderately more challenging. Introduced 2 new stats replacing Evasion: Mitigation Chance and Mitigation Strength. Mitigation Chance determines how often the player has a chance to reduce incoming damage. Mitigation Strength determines the percentage by which damage is reduced (50% by default). Components that used to increase Evasion now affect Mitigation. For example: the Reflexes attribute, perks such as Mongoose, Vanishing Point, Human Shield, some clothing mods and cyberware, and more. Rebalanced Damage Over Time effects, generally reducing primary damage effects such as Burning, Bleeding and Poison. Reduced chance to disrupt trajectory of smart bullets by Tyger Claws’ Glowing Tattoos ability. Added a quieter way to escape the NCPD when the heat is on. Instead of fleeing a certain distance from the most recent crime scene, V can opt to hide within the search area, although it will take longer for the police to stop looking.\nCyberware\nIt’s now possible to sell unused cyberware at a Ripperdoc. Cooldown duration is now properly described in the tooltip of Blood Pump cyberware. Made it possible to interrupt the Revealing Position hack by damaging the netrunner or by having immunity from Self-ICE cyberware. Activating Berserk will now double Stamina instead of granting an infinite amount. Tranquilizer Rounds in the Projectile Launch System no longer affect non-human NPCs. Reduced the ricochet number of the Legendary Ballistic Coprocessor to 1, but grants a 50% bonus to ricochet damage. Trajectory Generator (Kiroshi Optics mod) has been changed to Threat Analysis and now grants a 2% Mitigation Chance. Mitigation grants a chance to reduce incoming damage by the percentage indicated by Mitigation Strength (50% by default). Increased duration of Optical Camo cyberware for V from 5/10/15 to 10/15/15 per rarity level. Added the Optical Camo ability for some NPCs. Even with Optical Camo active, the player will now be visible while grappling an enemy. Fixed an issue where it wasn’t possible to equip some cyberware mods simultaneously.\nCombat\nNumerous optimizations to combat AI resulting in an overall improved combat experience. Numerous fixes and improvements were made to reduce interruptions and smoothen NPC animations in combat, including attack, death, equip weapon, cover, hit reaction, reload, block and dodge animations. You can expect more consistent feeling of impact and crowd control from weapons as well as more spectacular visuals. Enemies will now correctly reposition to more tactically advantageous positions. Increased followers’ shooting accuracy. Reduced explosion damage dealt to the player. Fixed cases where NPCs from the same group or faction didn’t join combat when they witnessed their comrades fighting. Fixed an issue whereby NPCs didn’t display a proper hit reaction when hit with a grenade upon entering combat. Enemy shotgunners will now attempt to keep a closer distance to the player during combat. Added some visual effects to the combat stims used by enemies. Enemies equipped with combat stims will use them only when their health is below 30%, reducing their overall stimulant usage. Increased visual complexity of enemy combat behavior in low-framerate mode. Fixed an issue when combat mode was triggered while roaming. Fixed an issue where the player could be knocked down by a hammer attack despite the weapon not reaching them. Significantly sped up switching between melee and ranged weapons for NPCs that can use both.\nQuickhacking\nIt’s no longer possible to apply the Cyberpsychosis quickhack on cyberpsychos. Fixed an issue where deactivating a camera with a quickhack wouldn’t interrupt enemy quickhack upload when the camera in question was used as a connection proxy. Fixed cases where a “hacked” status effect could remain on V permanently, preventing netrunners from hacking V again. Fixed an issue where, in some cases, the Whistle quickhack didn’t cause NPCs to approach V’s position.\nItems and Devices\nIt’s now possible to turn devices on and off while carrying a body. Fixed an issue where elevator door animations did sometimes not display properly, causing the player to see beyond world boundaries.\nNPCs\nLowered the health of the opponents in Beat on the Brat, except for the Twins - they can now block and/or evade attacks, so their difficulty is based more on skill. Woodman now prefers using the same Ajax rifle that he drops as loot. He was also demoted from a boss to a standard enemy. Fixed NPC behavior during Sasquatch, Oda, Adam Smasher, Royce and Beat on the Brat boss fights. Fixed an issue where enemy NPCs couldn’t break V’s guard in melee fights. Fixed clipping in V’s and NPCs’ aerial takedowns. Spin and kick melee attacks are now allowed only on fast, agile enemy archetypes. Cold Blood experience will no longer be awarded when dispatching enemies while having no Cold Blood effect active. The amount of Cold Blood experience granted for dispatching enemies increases with the amount of active Cold Blood stacks. Fixed clipping when grappling enemies from the crouched position. Enemy shotgunners now deal more damage. Enemies are less likely to attack V while V is performing a finisher. Increased damage dealt by sniper NPCs. Snipers will now be able to shoot when backing away from their target. Disabled tripping over bodies for V’s companions. Rebalanced NPC Stamina. NPCs crushed by a vehicle that are unable to recover will die after some time. Fixed V’s death animations that play while grappling an NPC. Fixed an issue where security, bouncers and police NPCs could have a bounty on them. Fixed some instances of NPCs T-posing. Fixed an issue where NPCs with the ability to apply status effects weren’t able to do so. Added a 15% health debuff for enemies that have the Kerenzikov ability to compensate for more successful dodging.\nPerks Rebalanced various perks and moved some of them in the skill tree. As a result, all the Perk points you spent were reset. Go to the Perks screen to reassign your Perk points for free. Redesigned the following perks:\nBloodswell Human Shield Epimorphosis Cold Blood Coldest Blood Cutthroat Due to the above-mentioned changes in perks, we renamed the Stealth skill tree to Ninjutsu in order to better reflect the perks it contains. Made the bonuses dynamic for 200% Efficiency, Field Technician and Cutting Edge. They are now applied to already crafted weapons and clothes. Respecing perks removes the bonuses correctly.\nPlayer Mechanics\nV is now able to vault/climb/jump/sprint through glass that has been fractured. Fixed an issue where disposing a body into a crate could move V into walls or out of bounds.\nVehicles\nFixed an issue when summoned vehicles could spawn within each other, resulting in either shattering to pieces or being launched in the air. Fixed an issue where hijacking a car with a hostile NPC inside caused them to clip through the roof and remain inside the vehicle. Fixed an issue where vehicles could be frozen in the air after loading a save file. Now they are just regular boring cars that fall down.\nWeapons\nReworked throwing knives - knives are not lost after each throw, but automatically return to V’s hands after a set cooldown time (dependent of knife rarity). It’s also possible to pick up thrown knives, resetting the cooldown. The Stinger Iconic knife now scales properly to V’s level when obtained. Sped up Smart Gun projectiles on different weapons to the same value as in the Kang Tao G-58 Dian for a better feeling of impact and speed. Increased silenced gunshot sound range from 3m to 8m. The “Stamina Cost Reduction While Attacking” stat on melee weapons works correctly now. Crunch, Cold Shoulder and Pax weapon mods will increase weapon damage by a percentage value. The level requirement of melee weapons will now increase with each upgrade. Note: the level of upgraded melee weapons will be adjusted as a result of this change. The equipped items which exceed the level requirement can continue being used but, if unequipped, will have to wait until the required level is reached to be used again. The DR5 Nova obtained during the Stadium Love quest has stats properly balanced to V’s level. The Crusher is no longer a viable weapon to use during the shooting competition in the Shoot to Thrill quest. Added aim assist to the bottles in Cassidy’s challenge in We Gotta Live Together to make it easier to beat with a gamepad.

Activating Berserk will now double Stamina instead of granting an infinite amount. Tranquilizer Rounds in the Projectile Launch System no longer affect non-human NPCs. Reduced the ricochet number of the Legendary Ballistic Coprocessor to 1, but grants a 50% bonus to ricochet damage. Trajectory Generator (Kiroshi Optics mod) has been changed to Threat Analysis and now grants a 2% Mitigation Chance. Mitigation grants a chance to reduce incoming damage by the percentage indicated by Mitigation Strength (50% by default). Increased duration of Optical Camo cyberware for V from 5/10/15 to 10/15/15 per rarity level. Added the Optical Camo ability for some NPCs. Even with Optical Camo active, the player will now be visible while grappling an enemy. Fixed an issue where it wasn&rsquo;t possible to equip some cyberware mods simultaneously.</p><p>Combat</p><p>Numerous optimizations to combat AI resulting in an overall improved combat experience. Numerous fixes and improvements were made to reduce interruptions and smoothen NPC animations in combat, including attack, death, equip weapon, cover, hit reaction, reload, block and dodge animations. You can expect more consistent feeling of impact and crowd control from weapons as well as more spectacular visuals. Enemies will now correctly reposition to more tactically advantageous positions. Increased followers&rsquo; shooting accuracy. Reduced explosion damage dealt to the player. Fixed cases where NPCs from the same group or faction didn&rsquo;t join combat when they witnessed their comrades fighting. Fixed an issue whereby NPCs didn&rsquo;t display a proper hit reaction when hit with a grenade upon entering combat. Enemy shotgunners will now attempt to keep a closer distance to the player during combat. Added some visual effects to the combat stims used by enemies. Enemies equipped with combat stims will use them only when their health is below 30%, reducing their overall stimulant usage. Increased visual complexity of enemy combat behavior in low-framerate mode. Fixed an issue when combat mode was triggered while roaming. Fixed an issue where the player could be knocked down by a hammer attack despite the weapon not reaching them. Significantly sped up switching between melee and ranged weapons for NPCs that can use both.</p><p>Quickhacking</p><p>It&rsquo;s no longer possible to apply the Cyberpsychosis quickhack on cyberpsychos. Fixed an issue where deactivating a camera with a quickhack wouldn&rsquo;t interrupt enemy quickhack upload when the camera in question was used as a connection proxy. Fixed cases where a &ldquo;hacked&rdquo; status effect could remain on V permanently, preventing netrunners from hacking V again. Fixed an issue where, in some cases, the Whistle quickhack didn&rsquo;t cause NPCs to approach V&rsquo;s position.</p><p>Items and Devices</p><p>It&rsquo;s now possible to turn devices on and off while carrying a body. Fixed an issue where elevator door animations did sometimes not display properly, causing the player to see beyond world boundaries.</p><p>NPCs</p><p>Lowered the health of the opponents in Beat on the Brat, except for the Twins - they can now block and/or evade attacks, so their difficulty is based more on skill. Woodman now prefers using the same Ajax rifle that he drops as loot. He was also demoted from a boss to a standard enemy. Fixed NPC behavior during Sasquatch, Oda, Adam Smasher, Royce and Beat on the Brat boss fights. Fixed an issue where enemy NPCs couldn&rsquo;t break V&rsquo;s guard in melee fights. Fixed clipping in V&rsquo;s and NPCs&rsquo; aerial takedowns. Spin and kick melee attacks are now allowed only on fast, agile enemy archetypes. Cold Blood experience will no longer be awarded when dispatching enemies while having no Cold Blood effect active. The amount of Cold Blood experience granted for dispatching enemies increases with the amount of active Cold Blood stacks. Fixed clipping when grappling enemies from the crouched position. Enemy shotgunners now deal more damage. Enemies are less likely to attack V while V is performing a finisher. Increased damage dealt by sniper NPCs. Snipers will now be able to shoot when backing away from their target. Disabled tripping over bodies for V&rsquo;s companions. Rebalanced NPC Stamina. NPCs crushed by a vehicle that are unable to recover will die after some time. Fixed V&rsquo;s death animations that play while grappling an NPC. Fixed an issue where security, bouncers and police NPCs could have a bounty on them. Fixed some instances of NPCs T-posing. Fixed an issue where NPCs with the ability to apply status effects weren&rsquo;t able to do so. Added a 15% health debuff for enemies that have the Kerenzikov ability to compensate for more successful dodging.</p><p>Perks
Rebalanced various perks and moved some of them in the skill tree. As a result, all the Perk points you spent were reset. Go to the Perks screen to reassign your Perk points for free.
Redesigned the following perks:</p><p>Bloodswell Human Shield Epimorphosis Cold Blood Coldest Blood Cutthroat Due to the above-mentioned changes in perks, we renamed the Stealth skill tree to Ninjutsu in order to better reflect the perks it contains. Made the bonuses dynamic for 200% Efficiency, Field Technician and Cutting Edge. They are now applied to already crafted weapons and clothes. Respecing perks removes the bonuses correctly.</p><p>Player Mechanics</p><p>V is now able to vault/climb/jump/sprint through glass that has been fractured. Fixed an issue where disposing a body into a crate could move V into walls or out of bounds.</p><p>Vehicles</p><p>Fixed an issue when summoned vehicles could spawn within each other, resulting in either shattering to pieces or being launched in the air. Fixed an issue where hijacking a car with a hostile NPC inside caused them to clip through the roof and remain inside the vehicle. Fixed an issue where vehicles could be frozen in the air after loading a save file. Now they are just regular boring cars that fall down.</p><p>Weapons</p><p>Reworked throwing knives - knives are not lost after each throw, but automatically return to V&rsquo;s hands after a set cooldown time (dependent of knife rarity). It&rsquo;s also possible to pick up thrown knives, resetting the cooldown. The Stinger Iconic knife now scales properly to V&rsquo;s level when obtained. Sped up Smart Gun projectiles on different weapons to the same value as in the Kang Tao G-58 Dian for a better feeling of impact and speed. Increased silenced gunshot sound range from 3m to 8m. The &ldquo;Stamina Cost Reduction While Attacking&rdquo; stat on melee weapons works correctly now. Crunch, Cold Shoulder and Pax weapon mods will increase weapon damage by a percentage value. The level requirement of melee weapons will now increase with each upgrade. Note: the level of upgraded melee weapons will be adjusted as a result of this change. The equipped items which exceed the level requirement can continue being used but, if unequipped, will have to wait until the required level is reached to be used again. The DR5 Nova obtained during the Stadium Love quest has stats properly balanced to V&rsquo;s level. The Crusher is no longer a viable weapon to use during the shooting competition in the Shoot to Thrill quest. Added aim assist to the bottles in Cassidy&rsquo;s challenge in We Gotta Live Together to make it easier to beat with a gamepad.
