It is quite useful as players can purchase swords, guns, fruits, fighting style, and other in-game items with it. Players can find Beli by opening chest, defeating mobs, and from quests.

There is a slim 0.1% chance to attain Fruit from a chest. However, players can always buy this end-game item from the Merchant. This item is stored in a player’s inventory and won’t be lost if they die. There are numerous types of Fruits available in the game. A list of available Fruits in A One Piece Game Trello \u0026 Wiki is given below.\nA One Piece Game NPC Trello \u0026 Wiki Set Spawn This NPC sets the spawnpoint.\nRayleigh This NPC can be found in the Random Wilderness and can tech players Haki for 700K Beli.\nMerchant Players can find this NPC in Logue Town and buy random fruits for 25M Beli.\nBusiness man Also located in Logue Town, this NPC allows players to remove their current Devil Fruit for 5M Beli or Robux.\nBlacksmith This NPC will take weapons.\nTraveling Merchant Players can get a Island Tracker Compass from this NPC that can point out Islands for 50,000 Beli.\nXury This NPC sells quest scrolls that can give players an extra quest slot.

Here is the A One Piece Game Trello \u0026 Wiki on each of these styles.\nCombat This is the basic fighting style that players get when starting out in the game. It only has one move and cannot be reverted back to once players upgrade to a better fighting style.\nFishman Karate This fighting style is great for PvP and has ranged moves. Players can use attack Shark Bullets to create mini sharks that explode on impact. Moreover, players can increase their skills damage and swim in the ocean with a Devil Fruit by using the Fishman attack. The other Fishman Karate attacks, Thousand Brick Fist and Kaimen Wari, are also capable of great chaos. While the Thousand Brick Fist cause a mid explosion on impact, players can create a punch shockwave with Kaimen Wari. The fighting style can be obtained by talking to Fisherman.\nElectro This is a high damage, high speed fighting style. Players can teleport to their cursor using this style. Also, using the Electro Smash, players can create a damage dealing lighting shockwave that can be activated by jumping and smashing the ground on the cursor location.

Lastly, the Electricity attack can can players hands to electrify and deal added damage. This fighting Style can be acquired by talking to Carrot.\nBlack Leg The last fighting technique is a great idea if players are planning to grind in A One Piece Game. It has a high AOE and medium Base Damage. Players can also opt for high damage with the Diable Jambe where players attacks cause burn damage. Like the Electro, this fighting style also has the option to teleport players to where their mouse is pointing with the Anti Manner Kick Course move. In addition, players can jump and smash the ground with Mouton Shot for an extremely powerful dropkick. This fighting style can be purchased by talking to Sanji.\nHaki The Haki is a mysterious power in A One Piece Game that can allow players to use their spiritual energy for a number of objectives. Let us take a look at the Haki available in the game and how to get them.\nArmament Haki This Haki allows players to create an invisible armor that offers great offensive and defensive buffs. Moreover, it can be used to injure Logia users that are immune to ordinary physical attacks. This Haki can be obtained from Rayleigh for 700K Beli.\nObservation Haki This Haki unlocks at 100 Haki stat. It allows users to develop a sixth sense and gain limited precognitive abilities.
