If you only played the hits this year, you missed out on those truly groundbreaking titles that reimagined what gaming can achieve as a medium. From soon-to-be cult hit like Inscryption to industry-changed accessibility efforts like The Vale: Shadow of the Crown, here are the best indie games we played in 2021.\nInscryption Inscryption is easier than you know. Pear-shaped card games allow players to sacrifice woodland creatures so they can play a larger, stronger card. But that is just beginning to describe one of the most subversive games I’ve ever played in my life. The mechanics of that language change the way players use their cards. Its story is kept secret, but its a genuine love letter to the lineage of digital cards and its culture. Inscryption is an unforgettable experience that is comparable to the original Portal.\nGo Before Your Eyes! It’s a game that you didn’t play with a controller. Instead, he connects to a webcam and is controlled by his blinks. It’s not just a random control scheme in order to do something else. The game follows a character as they get closer to their final lives, taking away their memories. When the player blinks, it skips through the memory. This makes the entire game a clever, well-liked adaptation of the phrase blink. You don’t get it wrong. This short piece is made to pull the best out of the window on the rules of gaming that tell a story that does only work with this level of interactivity.\nThe thoue: Shadow of the Crown. The Vale: The Crown goes one step further than ever before. This game is audio-only without graphics. This makes it virtually free to play for blind gamers. It’s not a simplistic title, either. It’s a full-action RPG starring a blind woman and an intelligent combat system that combines the sexy energy of a player with a sound sound. When enemies move and spin, they are pursuing their destiny. Whether you are looking for magic, bows, merchants all there. You’ll be surprised to learn how far great sound design can go toward filling in for graphics.\nDeaths Door Deaths Door is the person indie on this list who reached the top of our 100th top 2021 with giants like Metroid Dread. When you pick the controller it is easy to see why. It is a chapter VG Videogame that sharpens classic genre conventions. It is a riff of classic adventure games like Zelda, with effective combat and world design, built around interconnected shortcuts. Deaths Door is a deep quest for perfection and freedom when it’s time to let go. Memorable characters like Pussow (yes, Pussow) hold real-time importance in the grim reaper story of the avian.\nKena: A strong spirit. Kena: The Bridge of Spirits might be the best debut I’ve ever seen from a small studio. It’s highly slickly produced and confident that you might think that its a first-party Sony game. In real life, it’s a big game with a cashier starting with the invention of a large-scale developer. The animation experience shows, Kena’s stunning visuals are panned from the Pixar film. There’s a lot to love here, from its clever Pikmin-inspired mechanics to its surprisingly tough combat, but its environmental themes are real. Kena is a story about a girl walking through the ruins of a disaster and finding the motivation to take care of the damage caused to the earth and its people.\nSable Sable may not be the technically cleanest game of the year, but it made me the most emotionally motivated game. The open-world desert exploration game was about a young person who finds a way of passing in a rite of passage. The hero has to travel around the desert to help those in need to work out their path in life. Its extraordinary story written in the beginning, by striking visuals and incredible sound design, made me want to explore every corner of the desert. When I finally finished, I thought that it was time to find my characters true calling. This triggers an emotional response that stuck with me since the credits rolled.\nOverboard! There were just a few games this year that were so creative as Overboard! The visual novel-roguelike hybrid stars a woman who throws her husband off the ship (we all was here). It is the aim of our crew to convince them that she is innocent by lying through the teeth and covering up as much evidence as possible. It’s a reverse whodunit that tests how good players are at deception. I left the experience feeling a little worried about my lack of empathy for my murder.\nSolar Ash Solar Ash, a long-awaited follow-up to the indie hit Hyper Light Drifter, didn’t disappoint. Developer Heart Machines sophomore game is an intriguing sci-fi adventure about a planet being torn apart by a black hole as the global government talks about how to stop it. Players control Rei, a Voidrunner who must go around the decaying planet to activate a black hole-reversing Starseed. Mobility is the star of the show, because Rei kools and architecture with the keenness of a dancer. She also has huge bosses, which invoke the titans from Shadow of the Colossus. It’s harrowing, awe-inspiring, and an absolute vibe all-in-one.\nA dark tale by George. In a cartoon movie, players use magic paintbrushes to make color change into black and white countries. These pieces are clever enough to solve the puzzle. But Chicory is much more than a nice gimmick. This is a moving indie centered around imposter syndrome. The memorable cast of characters grapple with rage of anxiety reminiscent of the notion of artists. In a world where more people than ever want to create those themes, they feel especially relevant and help Chicory turn into a modern mental health parable.\nBoomerang X If you want pure fun, don’t sleep on Boomerang X. The indie action game is quick, frenetic and always exciting. Players attack with a boomerang in front of enemies, cutting down waves of monsters. Depending on the level, you’ll find more tools that take up action. Finals players can reduce time, target multiple enemies, or even talk with their boomerang in a flash. It’s as thrilling and high-octane as a billion dollar shooter you’ve played this year.\n","wordCount":"1065","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-14T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-14T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Joyce Bowland"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/10-awards-we-should-never-miss/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>10 Awards We Should Never Miss</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 14, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1065 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Joyce Bowland</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#inscryption>Inscryption</a></li><li><a href=#go-before-your-eyes>Go Before Your Eyes!</a></li><li><a href=#the-thoue-shadow-of-the-crown>The thoue: Shadow of the Crown.</a></li><li><a href=#deaths-door>Deaths Door</a></li><li><a href=#kena-a-strong-spirit>Kena: A strong spirit.</a></li><li><a href=#sable>Sable</a></li><li><a href=#overboard>Overboard!</a></li><li><a href=#solar-ash>Solar Ash</a></li><li><a href=#a-dark-tale-by-george>A dark tale by George.</a></li><li><a href=#boomerang-x>Boomerang X</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>This year, developers again demonstrated why the independent scene can’t be ignored.
