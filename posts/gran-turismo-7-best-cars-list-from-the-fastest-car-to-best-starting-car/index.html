Simply put, there’s no one answer. Thanks to being able to tweak so much within Gran Turismo 7, you can easily soup up a weaker car to be something far more spectacular. Of course, it’ll cost you a number of credits and it might still not feel as cool as going big straight away. This page covers our picks for the best cars as of the June 2022 update, as well as a look at the best cars for different regions and - of course - our pick for the fastest car in Gran Turismo 7. On this page: That’s why it’s useful to look at the best cars when it comes to raw power, handling ability, and Gran Turismo 7’s all-important way of rating its cars - Performance Points (PP). Thanks to the intricate nature of Gran Turismo 7, it’s possible to soup up cars to be a lot different from how they began when you first purchased them. It’s well worth doing but that’s not what we’re focusing on here. Instead, we’re looking at the base specs of each car and determining what we believe are the best choices. In reality, it’s like buying an actual car - different cars suit different driving styles, so it’s worth experimenting for yourself. Nothing beats finding the car for you that also looks super stylish, even if we haven’t already recommended it to you. Having said that, to give you a helping hand, that’s what his guide picks out a car for each scenario that is relatively simple to get in the game, and that works well for the given PP requirements that are often dished out for taking part in many races. We’ve also included some alternatives in each case. As of the June 2022 update, which has introduced an entirely new track to the series, the best car picks in each category have remained static, aside from the best Asia-Oceania choice. In other words, what was recommended at launch works just as well now. Since then, we’ve also introduced several new categories - including the best Kei car and best Vision GT car. Right at the start, we recommend the Toyota Aqua S ‘11. It’s a fairly dull looking hot hatch but it’s cheap and immediately accessible with 349.25PP. A mere 120 horsepower offers reasonable acceleration and its handling is fairly good for the price. The Honda Fit Hybrid is a little cheaper but its handling isn’t as reliable as the Toyota. If you’re keen to invest, the savings can be helpful when tuning the car yourself. In the case of this guide, we’re looking at the cars that have the highest top speed. Of course, we’re not ignoring great handling or good acceleration as both are important when achieving the top speed quoted. Fast cars in Gran Turismo 7 are best suited on tracks that have long straights to speed along, but when dealing with a more technical track, you may wish to favour a car with superior handling so that you can handle those tricky turns. Often, when tuning a car for speed, you actually want to focus on tyre quality rather than power, so make sure to upgrade your tyres to the right type to handle the road conditions you’re up against more appropriately. For absolute top speed, the best choice is the Dodge SRT Tomahawk X VGT. It is ludicrously fast. It offers 2,586 horsepower which means it can reach top speeds of up to 404mph. It’s incredibly light at 749KG and has a 7,000 cc engine with 1,336.12PP. Everything about it is excessive which is why it costs an eye-watering 1,000,000 credits via Brand Central. It’s definitely one to aim for, but there are other more achievable cars worth your money in the meantime. Another great choice is the Ferrari F12 Berlinetta ‘12. Awkwardly named, it may be, but it’s a good late campaign option if you’re trying to save cash. The car has 739 horsepower, 634.16PP, and costs a mere 373,000 credits. Okay, that’s not cheap, but you can get it for free. Complete Menu Book number 38 and you get the car along the way, but that’s right at the end of the game, so you might want to invest earlier. Either way, upgrade it as much as possible - but remember what we said about weight reduction being more important than power. Earlier on in the campaign, the BMW M3 ‘07 is a better option. It costs 93,000 credits which should be simple enough to grind towards, and it’s unlocked after completing menu book event 22. A PP of 533.76 feels positively sedate compared to the Tomahawk but you’ll appreciate its reliability and the ability to tune it up to 624.44PP. 415 horsepower is more than sufficient at this level. Whatever car you choose, account for the need for dirt tyres. They will reduce your PP significantly but they’re vital for rally racing. Our favourite rally car is the Audi Sport Quattro S1 Pikes Peak ‘87. It can be won from Menu Book 37 or bought from Brand Central but you really don’t need rally cars very often - with this in mind, it’s best off waiting until you unlock it in the campaign. With PP of 688.06, it’s roughly on a par with the other two cars that unlock at the same time - the Peugeot 205 Turbo 16 Evolution 2 ‘86 and Ford Focus Gr.B Rally Car which are roughly the same. It’s down to you which you end up feeling most comfortable with - ultimately, rallying really isn’t a significant part of the game.\nGran Turismo 7 best Kei car choice Post-release updates have brought about the Kei menu book option and that means a lot slower driving than before. A little like picking a starter car, there are pros and cons to all the Kei cars available and none are ideal. Our favourite Kei car is the Honda S660. It can be bought from Brand Central for 19,800 so it’s a bargain. At stock numbers, it only has a PP of 342.01 and 63 horsepower. Kei races require a PP of under 450 so you’ve got some room to upgrade to your liking, but don’t count on this being speedy. An alternative is the Daihatsu Copen ‘02 with a mere 285.45 and 62 horsepower. It has some more leverage for tweaking to your needs but we’re no fan of its looks.\nGran Turismo 7 best Vision GT car choice While the best Vision GT (VGT) car is the Dodge SRT Tomahawk X VGT, it’s often overpowered when it comes to being eligible for certain races. Instead, a more realistic option is the Suzuki VGT (Gr.3). It offers a fairly low (for the car type) 710.47 PP with stock parts. Available through Brand Central, it’s a pricey 450,000 credits but it can also be used as part of the Gr.1 Prototype Series of races that form menu book number 42, so it has a dual purpose here. It’s also a lot of fun to drive thanks to its 577 horsepower that feels suitably speedy while still leaving you in control when steering. Of course, where possible, upgrade it as much as you can but it’s a fine foundation to start out with. The Dodge SRT Tomahawk X VGT is the ideal choice but that’s prohibitively expensive for many people. Instead, we’re rather partial to the Chevrolet Corvette C7 ZR1 ‘19 Road Car. With a bit of credit farming, it’s reasonably achievable and it offers 641.08 PP for a good price of 134,000 credits. It’s a little heavy but its 754 horsepower is nothing to turn your nose up at. If you have the money to spend, there’s always the Dodge Viper SRT GT3-R ‘15 with a starting PP of 756.21. It’s pricey at 450,000 credits though! Many of the best European cars cost this kind of price - including the Jaguar Vision VGT SV and the McLaren VGT. A more achievable aim could be sticking with Bugatti and going for the Veyron Gr.4 with its 433 horsepower and 640 PP. It still costs 350,000 credits though! Lower still, there’s always the Porsche 911 GT3 (997) ‘09 with its 579.76 PP and 428 horsepower. That should put many players in good stead before the big money comes flying in. If you’re not a fan of tweaking settings, we’re still big fans of the Lexus LF-LC GT VGT. It has a hefty 851PP and offers 612 horsepower. It costs 1,000,000 credits so it’s expensive but it’s a well-balanced car that doesn’t take much adjustment to get used to. However, if you’re an old hand at the Gran Turismo franchise and you don’t mind a bit of a learning curve, you need the Suzuki V6 Escudo Pikes Peak Special. Added in June 2022’s update 1.17, it starts with 981 horsepower and 846.27PP. Add on the high-RPM Turbocharger and that instantly goes to a ludicrous 1,186 horsepower and 865.41PP. It also gets far more unwieldy in corners so you’ll need to practice with it, as well as tweak the brakes to correct oversteer. Experimenting with the suspension and nitrous can be worth your time too. The catch to all this besides the added time commitment? The V6 Escudo Pikes Peak Special costs a massive 1,700,000 credits from Legend Cars so it’s an aspirational vehicle. Expect to grind some credits to gain it, then spend more time getting things just right. You’ll be richly rewarded though.\rMore affordable and better for lower PP restrictions is the Nissan GT-R Nismo ‘17. It’s 187,000 credits and you get 591 horsepower and 619.07 PP. Four wheel drive means it’ll take some practice to master though. On a tight budget, don’t overlook the Honda Civic Type R Limited Edition (FK8) ‘20. Only 55,000 credits, it has 517.88 PP and 315 horsepower giving you the perfect foundations to build from. The Nissan Fairlady Z (Z34) ‘08 has similar stats for slightly less too. Whatever you choose - best of luck with your Gran Turismo 7 career!\n","wordCount":"1701","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-24T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-24T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bertha Driskell"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/gran-turismo-7-best-cars-list-from-the-fastest-car-to-best-starting-car/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Gran Turismo 7 Best Cars List From The Fastest Car To Best Starting Car</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 24, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1701 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Bertha Driskell</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#gran-turismo-7-best-kei-car-choice>Gran Turismo 7 best Kei car choice</a></li><li><a href=#gran-turismo-7-best-vision-gt-car-choice>Gran Turismo 7 best Vision GT car choice</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>While there may be &lsquo;just&rsquo; two types, there&rsquo;s a huge amount of choice when figuring out what Gran Turismo 6&rsquo;s best car is.

However, if you&rsquo;re an old hand at the Gran Turismo franchise and you don&rsquo;t mind a bit of a learning curve, you need the Suzuki V6 Escudo Pikes Peak Special.
Added in June 2022&rsquo;s update 1.17, it starts with 981 horsepower and 846.27PP. Add on the high-RPM Turbocharger and that instantly goes to a ludicrous 1,186 horsepower and 865.41PP.
It also gets far more unwieldy in corners so you&rsquo;ll need to practice with it, as well as tweak the brakes to correct oversteer. Experimenting with the suspension and nitrous can be worth your time too.
The catch to all this besides the added time commitment? The V6 Escudo Pikes Peak Special costs a massive 1,700,000 credits from Legend Cars so it&rsquo;s an aspirational vehicle. Expect to grind some credits to gain it, then spend more time getting things just right. You&rsquo;ll be richly rewarded though.
More affordable and better for lower PP restrictions is the Nissan GT-R Nismo &lsquo;17. It&rsquo;s 187,000 credits and you get 591 horsepower and 619.07 PP. Four wheel drive means it&rsquo;ll take some practice to master though.
On a tight budget, don&rsquo;t overlook the Honda Civic Type R Limited Edition (FK8) &lsquo;20. Only 55,000 credits, it has 517.88 PP and 315 horsepower giving you the perfect foundations to build from. The Nissan Fairlady Z (Z34) &lsquo;08 has similar stats for slightly less too.
Whatever you choose - best of luck with your Gran Turismo 7 career!</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/gran_turismo_7_best_cars_1.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/gran_turismo_7_best_cars_1.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Gran Turismo 7 best cars list  from the fastest car to best starting car -
