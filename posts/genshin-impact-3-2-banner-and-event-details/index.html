You need to be Adventure Rank 20 in order to take part. For this fun looking event, you take control of different characters for a unique challenge specific to them - if you don’t have a certain character yet, you’ll be able to control them through a trial period exclusive to the event. Challenges include testing your combat abilities with modifiers such as Elemental Bursts disabled, or collecting coins while trying to dodge various environmental obstacles, or using a plunging attack. Each character has their own unique challenge, essentially making this event a series of mini-games. To add to the fun, you can also take on each challenge with a friend in co-op.

You need to be Adventure Rank 30 and have completed the Chapter 1, Act 3 Archon Quest ‘A New Star Approaches’ in order to take part through the ‘Quick Start’ option in the event page. It’s also recommended to complete the Chapter 3, Act 5 Archon Quest ‘Akasha Pulses, The Kalpa Flame Rises’ and Yae Miko’s story quest to fully appreciate the narrative of the event, but is not required if entering through ‘Quick Start’. As for its gameplay, the Fabulous Fungus Frenzy event involves using a new limited-time gadget, the Wisdom Orb, to catch and battle various Fungi enemies found in the Sumeru region - which you can then rename and train. The training involves ‘cultivating’ the Fungi to unlock special skills by working out the correct jelly mixes in small puzzle sections involving moving and rotating nine jellies in a grid. We’ve got all the solutions here. To upgrade your Fungi’s special skills, you then need to go to a special training room and complete two types of challenges: Coordinated Assaults and Zone Defense. During these combat challenges, you get to control your Fungi in order to attack or defend the objective. The rewards you can receive from Fabulous Fungus Frenzy include:\nFree Dori character Primogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Crown of Insight Character Ascension Materials Talent Level-up Materials Character EXP Materials\nGenshin Impact Outside the Canvas, Inside the Lens event Outside the Canvas, Inside the Lens starts on Wednesday, 16th November and ends on Monday, 5th December.

The rewards you can receive from Outside the Canvas, Inside the Lens include:\nPrimogems Mora Character EXP Materials\nGenshin Impact Hypostatic Symphony: Dissonant Verse event Hypostatic Symphony: Dissonant Verse starts on Thursday, 24th November and ends on Monday, 5th December, and you need to be Adventure Rank 20 in order to take part. Those who’ve been playing Genshin Impact for a while will be familiar with the Hypostatic Symphony events which task you with battling Hypostasis of increasing difficulties - only this time, the new Dendro Hypostasis will feature as an additional enemy. Before each challenge, you can select a Dissonance buff effect to use. As the challenge difficulty increases, however, there will be less buffs to pick from. Make sure you’re using these buffs at the right moment to successfully clear these limited-time domains! It sounds like these challenges could get pretty tough, but as mentioned in the livestream, you don’t need to take on too many tough challenges if it’s just Primogems you’re after. Additionally, this Hypostatic Symphony: Dissonant Verse event can be played with a friend in co-op. The rewards you can earn from the Hypostatic Symphony: Dissonant Verse event include:\nPrimogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Weapon Enhancement Materials Character EXP Materials\nGenshin Impact Marvelous Merchandise event Marvelous Merchandise starts on Monday, 28th November and ends on Monday, 5th December, and you only need to be Adventure Rank 12 in order to take part.

All of these boxes include Primogems, but depending on what one you pick, you can choose other rewards like Mora, Mystic Enhancement Ore, and Ascension materials. Each day means you have to collect and trade three different material types, so if you want to be prepared, we recommend stocking up on materials like apples, carrots, fowl, and sweet flowers now.\nGenshin Impact 3.2 release date and time in UK, CEST, EDT and PDT Re-confirmed during the 3.2 livestream, developer miHoYo revealed that Genshin Impact 3.2 will release on Wednesday, 2nd November. It should follow the usual maintenance schedule for new updates, with 3.2 releasing approximately five hours after server downtime starting at 6am (UTC +8).\rAs this is only an approximate time for how long the servers are down, you might be able to play the 3.2 patch a little before or after the times below - although previous update estimates have been fairly accurate.

The rewards you can receive from Outside the Canvas, Inside the Lens include:</p><p>Primogems Mora Character EXP Materials</p><h3 id=genshin-impact-hypostatic-symphony-dissonant-verse-event>Genshin Impact Hypostatic Symphony: Dissonant Verse event<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-hypostatic-symphony-dissonant-verse-event>#</a></h3><p>Hypostatic Symphony: Dissonant Verse starts on Thursday, 24th November and ends on Monday, 5th December, and you need to be Adventure Rank 20 in order to take part.
Those who&rsquo;ve been playing Genshin Impact for a while will be familiar with the Hypostatic Symphony events which task you with battling Hypostasis of increasing difficulties - only this time, the new Dendro Hypostasis will feature as an additional enemy.
Before each challenge, you can select a Dissonance buff effect to use. As the challenge difficulty increases, however, there will be less buffs to pick from. Make sure you&rsquo;re using these buffs at the right moment to successfully clear these limited-time domains!
It sounds like these challenges could get pretty tough, but as mentioned in the livestream, you don&rsquo;t need to take on too many tough challenges if it&rsquo;s just Primogems you&rsquo;re after.
Additionally, this Hypostatic Symphony: Dissonant Verse event can be played with a friend in co-op.
The rewards you can earn from the Hypostatic Symphony: Dissonant Verse event include:</p><p>Primogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Weapon Enhancement Materials Character EXP Materials</p><h3 id=genshin-impact-marvelous-merchandise-event>Genshin Impact Marvelous Merchandise event<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-marvelous-merchandise-event>#</a></h3><p>Marvelous Merchandise starts on Monday, 28th November and ends on Monday, 5th December, and you only need to be Adventure Rank 12 in order to take part.
Just like previous Marvelous Merchandise events, when available, you can trade in various (mostly common) materials to the merchant Liben in exchange for a box of your choosing. All of these boxes include Primogems, but depending on what one you pick, you can choose other rewards like Mora, Mystic Enhancement Ore, and Ascension materials.
Each day means you have to collect and trade three different material types, so if you want to be prepared, we recommend stocking up on materials like apples, carrots, fowl, and sweet flowers now.</p><h2 id=genshin-impact-32-release-date-and-time-in-uk-cest-edt-and-pdt>Genshin Impact 3.2 release date and time in UK, CEST, EDT and PDT<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-32-release-date-and-time-in-uk-cest-edt-and-pdt>#</a></h2><p>Re-confirmed during the 3.2 livestream, developer miHoYo revealed that Genshin Impact 3.2 will release on Wednesday, 2nd November. It should follow the usual maintenance schedule for new updates, with 3.2 releasing approximately five hours after server downtime starting at 6am (UTC +8).
As this is only an approximate time for how long the servers are down, you might be able to play the 3.2 patch a little before or after the times below - although previous update estimates have been fairly accurate.
Keeping this in mind, the Genshin Impact 3.2 release time for other time zones should be as follows:</p><p>UK: Wednesday, 2nd November, 3am (GMT) Europe: Wednesday, 2nd November, 5am (CEST) East Coast US: Tuesday, 1st November, 11pm (EDT) Central US: Tuesday 27th November, 10pm (CDT) West Coast US:Tuesday 27th November, 8pm (PDT) Australia: Wednesday, 2nd November, 1pm (AEST) New Zealand: Wednesday, 2nd November, 3pm (NZST) Japan: Wednesday, 2nd November, 12pm (JST)</p><p>You can pre-install some 3.2 content now on PC and Mobile devices in advance to save time when the actual patch is available on Wednesday.
If you play on Mobile, either press the &lsquo;Pre-Install Resource Package&rsquo; icon in the bottom-left corner of the login screen, or go to the Paimon Menu and select &lsquo;Settings&rsquo;, &lsquo;Other&rsquo;, and finally &lsquo;Pre-Install Resource Package&rsquo;.
When the full update arrives, those on iOS devices must enter the App Store and tap &lsquo;Update&rsquo;. Android users can open the game and follow the directions on-screen or open Google Play and tap &lsquo;Update&rsquo;.
If you play Genshin Impact on PC, you can pre-install some of the 3.2 update by updating the Genshin Impact Launcher. After updating the launcher, a &lsquo;Game Pre-Installation&rsquo; button will appear to the left of the &lsquo;Launch&rsquo; button. Click &lsquo;Game Pre-Installation&rsquo; to download the 3.2 resources.
Hope you have fun during the Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises update!</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Genshin-Impact-next-Banner-3.2-Phase-1-Nahida-and-Yoimiya.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Genshin-Impact-next-Banner-3.2-Phase-1-Nahida-and-Yoimiya.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact 3 2 Banner and event details -
