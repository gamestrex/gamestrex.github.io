Mass Effect continues. On the surface, this is a high-down image of an impact crater with a parked rig, Mass Effect-y ship below. Three figures seemed to have exited the vessel to reach the site of the impact and a piece of debris was placed on the road. First, let’s look at that impact site. The whole shape of the image appears deliberately to be a head of a geth (and indeed, if all is possible, it appears to be a geth corpse lying on its side, a debris in front of the crater to the right). The object in the center of the crater looks metallic, and may have marks engraved on it. Is that a ship crash, or a gallant bullet hole that’s left over in an ancient war? So why does the centre look so fresh? Did it be excavated recently? Since the numbers were enlarged into the figures with the ship’s looming, there’s no doubt that a krogan is here. The krogan’s armour is red. Some fans have said it would be Wrex. Can the time be used? Krogan lives for up to 1000 years, so yes, although it would mean that BioWare picks a canon as far as Wrex survived the trilogy. The other figures are hard to make, but their armours are white, blue and grey as well as the Pathfinders/Andromeda initiative. Hmm… Moving forward to the ship, it’s evidently a new design that hasn’t been seen before, albeit one reminiscent of the Normandy and Tempest. The original art teases show that the smaller, ruggeder vehicle, BioWare has called the “Mudskipper”. It’s clear that it’s not this. The idea, then, is that the main ship players will get to play with in the next game – perhaps later when they find out a bit more freedom. Can this also cross the galaxie area to allow hopping between the Milky Way and Andromeda? Perhaps not without another technology, but if that’s the case, it seems much better suited to the job than the Mudskipper we were expecting. The ‘Mudskipper’ craft is the previous. Once we zoom in, we can see how guns amounted to the new ship’s front, a thing the old day is interesting, since Tempest is a very different style, and as a consequence, the period of the second war is over. Oh, that isn’t a time for galactic peace?! The ship is emblazoned with letters “SFX” – as similar to that of “SR1”, which stands for Special Reconnaissance 1. As Shinobi pointed out in the article, this is certainly a hint to the original codename for the first mass effect in BioWare: SFX.

Mass Effect continues.
On the surface, this is a high-down image of an impact crater with a parked rig, Mass Effect-y ship below. Three figures seemed to have exited the vessel to reach the site of the impact and a piece of debris was placed on the road.
First, let’s look at that impact site. The whole shape of the image appears deliberately to be a head of a geth (and indeed, if all is possible, it appears to be a geth corpse lying on its side, a debris in front of the crater to the right).
