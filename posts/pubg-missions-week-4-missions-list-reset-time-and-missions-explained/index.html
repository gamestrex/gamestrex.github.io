Meanwhile, we’ve dedicated pages on the Sanhok map, Erangel map and Miramar map and Vikendi map, too. If you’re after some broader advice, our list of PUBG tips and tricks, PUBG weapon damage stats and the best weapons and best PUBG loot locations can help.\rThings differ, however, depending on whether or not you’ve bought an Event Pass. If you have one, you’ll have more Missions available to you - and therefore more ways of earning XP - as well as far more rewards availble when you do level up from all that XP, too. You can read more detail on those rewards and pass vs non-pass differences in our page on the PUBG Event Pass and rewards itself, but the key point is this: you can earn a small amount of rewards without a pass, and a large amount with one, but if you want one you’re going to have to pay for the privilege. How do the Missions work? The Missions themselves are split into a few different categories: Daily Missions, Normal Missions, Sanhok (Event) Missions, and Weekly Missions (there are four weeks to the event). Most of the time they key is in the name: Daily Missions expire and update daily, Weekly Missions become available each week - although it’s not clear right now whether you’ll be able to complete last weeks Missions, like you can with Fortnite Challenges, or if they expire at the end of that week. The Normal Missions are general things you can do in PUBG on various maps and modes, whilst the Sanhok Missions are Event-specific. With this Event being based around Sanhok, obviously that new tropical map is the focus, and so they can only be unlocked by playing on that specific map. The first Missions - daily and weekly - went live at the following times and dates worldwide:\nWest Coast US: 5pm , June 21st (PDT) UK: 1am, June 22nd (BST) Europe: 2am, June 22nd (CEST) Korea: 9am, June 22nd (KST)\nWe’d imagine Daily Missions would reset at Midnight wherever you are, but there’s no guaruntee that’ll be true - what we can expect, at least, is that Weekly Missions will update every Thursday evening US time, or very early in the small hours of Friday morning for those in the UK and Europe. We’ll update this page when we know more!\n","wordCount":"1245","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-28T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-28T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"James Colindres"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/pubg-missions-week-4-missions-list-reset-time-and-missions-explained/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Pubg Missions Week 4 Missions List Reset Time And Missions Explained</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-28 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 28, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1245 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;James Colindres</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>The first event, Sanhok, is now over, but the missions were all fairly straightforward, at least compared to their Fortnite counterparts, with Missions generally requiring you to spend certain amounts of time on maps, travel certain distances, and rack up a certain number of kills.
