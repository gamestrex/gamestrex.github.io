This page is part of our guides to each of PUBG’s maps. For more, head to our dedicated pages on Sanhok, Erangel and Miramar, Vikendi or look at all of the best PUBG loot locations in one place.\rOn this page: Snow Map Vikendi size, footprints, new parachuting and other new details Vikendi is a 6x6 map, plonking it firmly between the 4x4 kilometre map of Sanhok and the 8x8 kilometre Erangel and Miramar ones as we noted above. In effect, it’s designed to play like a hybrid of the two sizes, too: a little faster than the two large ones but a little more ’tactical’ than Sanhok, and in practise that’s largely the case. The other main Vikendi-specific feature to note is the addition of footprints, which seem pretty insignificant but can, in some cases, make a real difference to your approach. They’re essentially the open doors of the wilderness, if you want to sound poetic - or in other words they’re an indicator that someone has been there recently. They last for ten minutes as one keen player, TheDirewolf, shows in this video, which if anything actually makes them slightly less impactful: with Vikendi matches lasting around twenty minutes, a ten minute timer on footprints means the person who was once in that spot could be long gone by now. There are changes to vehicles on Vikendi, too: regular vehicles, including four-wheel-drives like the Jeep, will struggle in snow, particularly when going up-hill, and will slide around a little when trying to steer - which is fun! That’s mitigated by the introduction of a new vehicle, the Snowmobile, which is a rather gorgeous two-seater that handles much better on snow, but much worse on regular terrain like roads and regular ground. The newer form of parachuting, too, means that almost the entire Vikendi map is available from the off on almost any flyover route, but you’ll of course be landing much later than your opponents if you choose to glide over a long distance. PUBG update #29 is live: here’s our guide to the latest PUBG patch notes for update 29 to get you up to speed. Meanwhile, we’ve dedicated pages on the Sanhok map, Erangel map and Miramar map and Vikendi map, too. If you’re after some broader advice, our list of PUBG tips and tricks, PUBG weapon damage stats and the best weapons and best PUBG loot locations can help.\rVikendi Unique vehicles:\nSnowmobile - 2 seater land vehicle Snow Bike - 2 seater snow motorbike Zima - 4 seater SUV replacing the UAZ\nVikendi Unique weapons:\nMP5K - SMG replacing the Vector\nWeather, night more and other things unique to Vikendi:\nVikendi has three kinds of weather available: Day (clear), Snow, Moonlight (night).\nPUBG Vikendi best start locations:\nSecret Loot Cave - This is found at the dark spot on the map between Peshkova and Podvosto. Look for a rocky wall, and crash into it with a vehicle or throw a grenade at it to break the rocks to find a secret tunnel to a cave full of loot! This used to feature Crate-exlusive items but has now been nerfed, since the secret’s out. Still a fantastic, small area with a very high density of high-quality loot. Cosmodrome - A big, fun area, but stay away from the main tower, as the loot is too spread out in there. Stick to the smaller surrounding buildings though and you’ll do very well.\nDobro Mesto - The large central building has fantastic loot (we’ve found level three helemts, armour and backpacks all in one go before), and there are plenty of buildings around it to supplement. Also a safer bet being away from the busy centre of the island which helps. Dino Park - The loot is slightly spread out, but it’s perfect for a solo or duo run in particular, which a medium amount of high-quality stuff. Castle - A huge amount of loot at a good quality, but it’s dangerously central and relatively cut off, making it hard to escape safely. It’s also easy to get lost in, so it’s not the fastest to sweep for gear, but almost always worth the risk. Villa - PUBG loves a good central villa full of loot. Not quite as good as Miramar’s Hacienda but not far off. Expect a fight though! Volnova - Very high loot density, but as it’s a typical large town it’s going to take you time to work through all the separate buildings, and there’ll always be someone there, which doesn’t make it any easier. Winery - A personal favourite, the Winery, which you can quickly follow up with the Abbey, has loads of good loot in relative close proximity, and it’s quieter than most other spots, being down on one coast of the island. Why not stay a while and relax here with a glass of red?\nRemember to head to our dedicated PUBG loot locations page too, for a look at where to loot on every map in more detail! PUBG snow map strategies\nDress for the occasion - If you’re really keen, have a set wardrobe of gear you can equip when you know you’re going to be playing Vikendi. Go for light coloured clothes if you’re going to be quitting and retrying until you get a daytime game, or black and dark clothes if you want a night map! Beware your own tracks, and look out for others - vehicles in particular leave big, obvious tracks in the snow. Factor in the way tracks disappear after a set amount of time, and leaving tracks of your own, or spotting others, is a big clue for enemies or yourself. Be especially aware of leaving footprints if you’re planning on camping somewhere, as they’ll make it extra easy for someone to find and flank you. Vikendi is one of the stealthiest maps - between the camouflage-friendly environment, the moderate size and the varied, hilly terrain, Vikendi is great for stealthy players. A sniper or DMR combined with a flexible AR is the go-to loadout for most players.\nAs we mentioned above, we’ll be looking at these in more detail in the coming days and weeks, and will circle back to update with some more detail as the slightly strange loot situation settles down.\n","wordCount":"1124","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-28T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-28T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Doug Sanchez"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/pubg-vikendi-map-vehicles-size-best-start-locations-and-snow-map-strategies/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Pubg Vikendi Map Vehicles Size Best Start Locations And Snow Map Strategies</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-28 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 28, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1124 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Doug Sanchez</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>It&rsquo;s an interesting one, sitting in the mid-size territory between the smaller Sanhok and larger Erangel and Miramar maps, and it brings some new mechanics and strategic elements like footprints with it, too.
