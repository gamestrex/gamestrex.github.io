This page explains how to complete Castle Morne, including how to find the Castle Morne location, how to start and complete Irina’s quest, how to find father Edgar and all the relevant items’ locations. On this page: Looking for some direction? Our what to do first in Elden Ring, Elden Ring walkthrough, Site of Grace locations and main bosses in order pages can help. To enter Weeping Peninsula, you need to go to the south of Limgrave - Elden Ring’s beginning area. There’s a bridge that connects the peninsula with the rest of Limgrave, right next to the Forlorn Hound Evergaol. The Agheel Lake South Site of Grace is the nearest one to the bridge, and it will also indicate to you the way to the castle. The path to Bridge of Sacrifice is pretty straightforward; ride Torrent south from the previous Site of Grace and you’ll find four towers and multiple soldiers between barricades defending the bridge.\nWhile you can start taking one or two enemies at a time if you approach cautiously, and even summon Spirit Ashes to aid you, you shouldn’t do it. The thing is, there’s a soldier using a heavy stationary crossbow behind the enemy lines. He’ll start using the weaponry as soon as you get close to the bridge, so you might end up receiving a shot while focusing on the first enemies. Instead, you should rush into the bridge and kill this soldier while riding your horse. Then, the rest of the battle will be more manageable. After cleaning the bridge, check the left side of it. There will be three Smithing Stones 1. There’s also a Stonesword Key on a corpse near the barricades behind the crossbow. At the end of the bridge, you’ll have reached Weeping Peninsula. You can also see the first Site of Grace from there, on the right side of the path. Irina will finish her first dialogue by speaking about her father, the commander of the castle. Talk to her again and she will ask you to deliver a letter to her father. Choose the dialogue option to accept the task. Irina will thank you and give you the item. Now it’s time to go and find the castle. If you decide to go stealthily, you just need to go to the left side of the broken carriage - there are some bushes and dogs here. You’ll need to kill two dogs, but that’s about it. On the contrary, if you want to kill them all, don’t forget that you can summon your Spirit Ashes to even the odds. Before doing that, however, ride Torrent and run between the enemies. The inhuman creatures will attack the knights, so you won’t have to beat them all by yourself. By cleaning the place, you’ll find the Iron Cleaver weapon on a broken cart and two Smithing Stones 1 a few steps ahead. Continue the main path and you’ll spot a Teardrop Scarab. Kill it and you’ll get the Ash of War Mighty Shot. Keep going forward and when the path opens in multiple ways, just keep following the main road on your map. After a few, you’ll find a Site of Grace and a Nomadic Merchant on the left. Once you have checked them, return to the main road and continue your way. Here Castle Morne will be at sight. You’ll also see the area’s map fragment on the right, but don’t hesitate too much - pick it quickly and return to Torrent. There’s a giant archer far away, which will start shooting huge arrows at you. Instead of going towards the giant, go to the left of the area, through a forest. You’ll end up in a small swamp with some enemies, but you can easily avoid them. Following this road, there’ll be fewer chances for the archer to get you. The entry to Castle Morne will be guarded only by the archer. Luckily, you don’t have to kill the giant - just go run to the castle’s door and you’ll be fine. If you want to try your luck, however, notice that the enemy won’t attack you with its bow at a close-combat nor take out another weapon. The giant will only attack using stomps, which makes the battle easier than the ones against other giants in the game. Once you’re inside the castle, you’ll find a Site of Grace in a room full of fallen soldiers. Again, you can choose to either avoid every enemy here or go ballistic. If you decide the former option, crouch and go through the middle of the courtyard - almost touching the creature on the right. You can also avoid the Mad Pumpkin Head enemy resting in front of you, just leave him to rest and sneak to the right. There’ll be a single enemy on the way, working the ground, but just pass through him while crouching and it won’t even blink. There’ll be a ladder at the end of the path. If you decide to sneak in, however, you’ll miss some important items. First of all, go to the left until you enter a platform. There will be a single dog wandering around. Kill it and get the Smithing Stone 2 in the place. Then, instead of attacking the enemies on the right, bait them to follow you and lead them to the Mad Pumpkin Head. This big creature will wake up and start attacking the other beasts. Only after the Mad Pumpkin Head is done, step in and kill the remaining enemies - don’t forget that you can summon Spirit Ashes here. It’s time to collect items. On the left side of where the Mad Pumpkin Head was resting, you will find three Smithing Stones 1. Next, near the fire pits and mountains of corpses, you’ll find multiple Smoldering Butterflies and two Fire Grease. If you continue in this direction (past the fire pit), you can enter a new room inside the castle. There’ll be a chest with a Claymore on the left. After collecting the loot, go down the stairs. There’ll be two inhuman enemies killing a knight that has surrendered. Take advantage and start hitting them from far away with a ranged weapon. Use the ladder on the right and you’ll arrive at the top of one of the castle’s towers. Here will be a battle against human and non-human enemies. Let them beat each other and attack the only soldier free - the one with the crossbow. On the other side of the hanging platform on your right, there will be a Furcalling Finger Remedy. After collecting it, you can clean the remaining enemies. Now go to the only path available, where there are two enemies. Kill them and pick up the Steel-Wire Torch. Then, you’ll have to walk some steps back and fall from the platform with the side destroyed. Go forward and one inhuman enemy will come to you. Deal with them and continue near the hanged people. Three enemies will come out, a regular one and two that flies. They aren’t much more complicated, and you can make them fall with one or two jumping attacks. Now you will have three ways available (the left one is covered with boxes). First, go to the right. You’ll descend a bit, and then find another small passage with two enemies - beware of one of them hiding on your right. Kill them and take the collectible at the end of the path: two Smithing Stones 2. Return and go to the left (the previously blocked ladder). Descend and, depending on how much time it took you to reach here, you’ll see humans and non-humans fighting again. Let’s repeat the same strategy: wait for them to kill each other, defeat the remaining ones, and then move forward. You’ll see a ladder that will lead you to where Edgar, the lord of the castle and Irina’s father, is standing. An option to give Irina’s letter to him will pop up. Accept it and he will read it. However, he’ll tell you that can’t leave until the castle and a mysterious sword are safe. Move forward and fall again a couple of times. You’ll reach another fork with two ways. This time, however, you’ll only select the left one (the other one is a trap). Go left and fall near some planks. It contains a Stonesword Key. Fall one more time, whenever you want, and move forward. There will be multiple enemies on the left, but they will be on their backs. You can back-stab them easily or just sneak around. On your right, there’ll be a door. Inside the room, there’ll be another enemy on his back. Then, on the left, there’ll be an item (a Pickled Turtle Neck). Before collecting that, however, check the blob above and attack it. Return outside and follow the only path. You can sneak your way forward, avoiding the enemies and the black slimes. However, when you reach the end of the road, there’ll be a bigger enemy waiting. Defeat it and climb the ladder on the left. Go around and open the chest with Twinblade Talisman. Now, you’ll have to go back a few steps, to the bridge, and fall forward multiple times. First on a tower, then on a piece of land. There will be Tarnished Golden Sunflowers and a Health Scarab in this small area. After beating the scarab, go to the right and jump. Keep going until you reach the top of a tower. You need to go all the way down from here using the open roof, but be careful; if you do the wrong jump, you’ll lose HP and be at disadvantage with what lies below. Instead, you need to fall into every single plank - the first one contains a corpse with one Smithing Stone 2. Once you descend into the second single plank, use any ranged weapon you have. There’ll be five rats below, and you can snipe the ones that are near. After you reach the floor, you’ll find a Whip on a corpse on one of the walls. Now get outside and turn left twice. You’ll find the last Site of Grace in Castle Morne. When you’re ready, use the bridge. There’ll be one of the bigger non-human enemies from before and a flying one. They might seem to be sleeping, but they will wake up as soon as you go near them. Kill both of them and pick up the Throwing Daggers around. Then, go to the right and use the ladder to descend. There’s a way to avoid the fight against these two enemies - which will become useful if you die in this last zone -, and it consists of falling from the bridge, whenever you want. You won’t receive damage, although I’d try to miss jumping into a jellyfish because they will become hostile. When you’re below, on the water level, go behind the building with the two enemies. You’ll find a Somber Smithing Stone 1. Warning: while you’re in this zone, please pay attention to the ground. If you see any kind of land, you’ll be able to step on it. But it’s very easy to miss and fall to your death. Return to the front of this building and go to the other one, on the left. You’ll find small crabs chilling. Take a few steps, however, and a giant crab will appear from below the ground. Beat it, follow the path, and pick up 15 Fire Arrows. The only thing missing now is the boss, Leonine Misbegotten. Go through the golden fog and defeat the beast. You’ll get the Grafted Blade Greatsword, 3800 runes, and a bronze trophy. Once you have settled on a starting class and starting Keepsake item, you should first work out how to level up, how to respec and use Ashes of War.\rNeed some direction from there? Our Elden Ring walkthrough and Elden Ring boss order can help with where to go next, but we also recommend hunting down Golden Seeds, Sacred Tears, Crystal Tears, Talismans and some of our best weapon and best armor choices.\rIf you are approaching the end game, we can help with the Volcano Manor quest and Rykard, Haligtree Secret Medallion locations, solving the Ordina, Liturgical Town puzzle, the Millicent quest, Commander Niall, Morgott, Godskin Duo, Maliketh and Malenia.\rRepeat all the directions and meet Edgar at the same exact spot. He tells you he’ll be back to his daughter. Finally, go back to the Bridge of Sacrifice Site of Grace and head where you met Irina for the first time. You’ll find his father here. However, she will be dead. If you talk to Edgar, he’ll lament himself and tell you about his wish for vengeance. If you followed this walkthrough correctly, you’ll have acquired all its important items and completed Irina’s quest.\n","wordCount":"2186","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-03T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-03T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kathy Revering"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/elden-ring-irina-quest-castle-morne-location-and-how-to-deliver-the-letter-to-father-edgar/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Elden Ring Irina Quest Castle Morne Location And How To Deliver The Letter To Father Edgar</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-03 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 3, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2186 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Kathy Revering</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>Along the way there&rsquo;s a good amount of items to collect, including multiple Smithing Stones and the unique Grafted Blade Greatsword.

However, when you reach the end of the road, there&rsquo;ll be a bigger enemy waiting. Defeat it and climb the ladder on the left. Go around and open the chest with Twinblade Talisman.
Now, you&rsquo;ll have to go back a few steps, to the bridge, and fall forward multiple times. First on a tower, then on a piece of land.
There will be Tarnished Golden Sunflowers and a Health Scarab in this small area.
After beating the scarab, go to the right and jump. Keep going until you reach the top of a tower.
You need to go all the way down from here using the open roof, but be careful; if you do the wrong jump, you&rsquo;ll lose HP and be at disadvantage with what lies below. Instead, you need to fall into every single plank - the first one contains a corpse with one Smithing Stone 2.
Once you descend into the second single plank, use any ranged weapon you have. There&rsquo;ll be five rats below, and you can snipe the ones that are near.
After you reach the floor, you&rsquo;ll find a Whip on a corpse on one of the walls.
Now get outside and turn left twice. You&rsquo;ll find the last Site of Grace in Castle Morne.
When you&rsquo;re ready, use the bridge. There&rsquo;ll be one of the bigger non-human enemies from before and a flying one. They might seem to be sleeping, but they will wake up as soon as you go near them.
Kill both of them and pick up the Throwing Daggers around. Then, go to the right and use the ladder to descend.
There&rsquo;s a way to avoid the fight against these two enemies - which will become useful if you die in this last zone -, and it consists of falling from the bridge, whenever you want. You won&rsquo;t receive damage, although I&rsquo;d try to miss jumping into a jellyfish because they will become hostile.
When you&rsquo;re below, on the water level, go behind the building with the two enemies. You&rsquo;ll find a Somber Smithing Stone 1.
Warning: while you&rsquo;re in this zone, please pay attention to the ground. If you see any kind of land, you&rsquo;ll be able to step on it. But it&rsquo;s very easy to miss and fall to your death.
Return to the front of this building and go to the other one, on the left. You&rsquo;ll find small crabs chilling. Take a few steps, however, and a giant crab will appear from below the ground. Beat it, follow the path, and pick up 15 Fire Arrows.
The only thing missing now is the boss, Leonine Misbegotten. Go through the golden fog and defeat the beast. You&rsquo;ll get the Grafted Blade Greatsword, 3800 runes, and a bronze trophy.
Once you have settled on a starting class and starting Keepsake item,
you should first work out how to level up, how to respec and use Ashes of War.
Need some direction from there? Our Elden Ring walkthrough and Elden Ring boss order can help with where to go next, but we also recommend hunting down Golden Seeds, Sacred Tears, Crystal Tears, Talismans and some of our best weapon and best armor choices.
If you are approaching the end game, we can help with the Volcano Manor quest and Rykard, Haligtree Secret Medallion locations, solving the Ordina, Liturgical Town puzzle, the Millicent quest, Commander Niall, Morgott, Godskin Duo, Maliketh and Malenia.
Repeat all the directions and meet Edgar at the same exact spot. He tells you he&rsquo;ll be back to his daughter.
Finally, go back to the Bridge of Sacrifice Site of Grace and head where you met Irina for the first time. You&rsquo;ll find his father here. However, she will be dead.
If you talk to Edgar, he&rsquo;ll lament himself and tell you about his wish for vengeance.
If you followed this walkthrough correctly, you&rsquo;ll have acquired all its important items and completed Irina&rsquo;s quest.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/elden_ring_castle_morne_walkthrough_1.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/elden_ring_castle_morne_walkthrough_1.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Elden Ring Irina quest  Castle Morne location and how to deliver the letter to father Edgar -
