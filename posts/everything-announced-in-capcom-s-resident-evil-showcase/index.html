The showcase kicked off with new Village trailer showing clips from early in the game, a radio broadcast calling for survivors, a look at the werewolf-like lycans, and Lady Dimitrescu taking a tasty sip of Ethan’s blood. Chris Redfield also puts in an appearance - but what he’s up to isn’t clear. You’ll be able to poke around all this for yourself with the game’s upcoming time-limited demo, which will let you play for 60 minutes on PlayStation 5, PS4, Stadia, Steam, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. This demo will be available for all platforms for 24 hours starting 2nd May at 1am UK time, or 2am in Europe. In North America, this will be from 1st May at 5pm Pacific for 24 hours. You will be able to choose between exploring the game’s village or castle areas, or dip into both if you so choose. But you only have 60 minutes total. PS4 and PS5 owners also get “8 Hours in Village”, where you can play both village and castle areas over preceding weekends. Each area will be opened up for eight hours, in which you can then play for 30 minutes. In the UK, the game’s village area will be available for PS4 and PS5 owners to sample from 18th April at 4pm until 19th April at midnight. In North America, this will be from 17th April at 5pm Pacific until 18th April at 1am. A week later, the game’s castle area will then be available for PS4 and PS5 owners from 25th April at 4pm UK until 26th April at midnight. In North America, that’ll be 24th April at 5pm Pacific until 25th April at 1am. You’ll have an eight-hour window to play each for 30 minutes, Capcom said. Yes, this is all a bit complicated. PS4 and PS5 owners can start downloading the demo today. Moving on, we got a look at Village’s Mercenaries mode - the fast-paced combat mode featured in numerous other Resi games which returns here with a few tweaks. New feature include the game’s Merchant popping up between areas, who sells supplies, guns and upgrades. You can also select abilities, which include skills where you can buff movement speed, weapon damage, armour, and more. Capcom’s competitive multiplayer Resident Evil Re:Verse was again mentioned as being free for Village owners, though there was no more new information shared on that. Next, we got a new trailer for Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness, the upcoming CGI series for Netflix starring Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield. It’ll launch in July this year, and is set in 2006, a couple of years after Resident Evil 4, so it will feature Ashley Graham’s father as president. (Will Ashley also return, and get to hide in more boxes? We’ll have to wait and see.) Live-action movie Welcome to Raccoon City has wrapped filming and is now in post-production, Capcom said, though there’s no word on a release date just yet. And in other news, Resident Evil will join Dead by Daylight in some capacity, with more details to be announced on 25th May. Capcom wrapped the show with an announcement of Resident Evil 4 VR for Oculus Quest 2, which is being developed by Armature. This version of the game moves its action to a first-person perspective - even its inventory management, which is now in 3D. More details will come as part of an Oculus showcase on 21st April.\ntitle: “Everything Announced In Capcom S Resident Evil Showcase” ShowToc: true date: “2022-12-24” author: “David Davis” As well as PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X, Village will also be released on the same date for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, Capcom confirmed (which had been uncertain until now). Excitingly, PS5 owners can play a non-combat demo set in Village’s castle area from tonight. This slice stars a new character named The Maiden trying to escape the area, and is designed to show off the game’s visuals, atmosphere and environmental detail. Less excitingly if you don’t have a PS5, tonight’s demo is PS5 exclusive and will never release elsewhere. A different demo will be available later this spring for all platforms. Village itself looks impressive - and for anyone who loved Resident Evil 4 back in the day, full of throwbacks to that beloved entry. The action starts in a European village but then moves to the castle area we saw today. Each area sounds like it will have a memorable boss character, with the castle ruled over by the tall vampiresque lady who got fans excited last weekend. This tall lady is seen speaking on the phone to someone named Mother Miranda, who sounds like her boss, and mentions her brother, who sounds like he was the boss of the game’s first area. The tall lady also introduces returning Resi 7 protagonist Ethan Winters to her three creepy daughters - who are not quite as tall, but can turn into swarms of flying insects (wasps? moths?). Resi 4 fans will note that Village includes the former’s brilliant Tetris-esque inventory management system. Village also features a merchant, who will pop up across the map. Village has many different editions available to purchase. Alongside the Standard Edition, there’s a Digital Deluxe Edition available on all platforms which includes Max Difficulty, Safe Room Music, a Mr Everywhere weapon charm, a Save Device tape recorder, an Albert01 gun, a Found Footage RE7 filter, and something called The Tragedy of Ethan Winters. There’s also a Collector’s Edition which includes the above digital items plus a box of physical bits such as a poster, artbook, Steelbook case and Chris Redfield figurine. Here’s where you can already pre-order Resident Evil Village. On top of these, Capcom will sell Resi 7 and Village together in a bundle if you haven’t played 7 yet. And if you pre-order Village there’s some bonuses - an in-game Mr Racoon weapon charm and handful of survival items to help you early on. Digital orders from the PlayStation Store also get a digital soundtrack. Elsewhere in the showcase, Capcom revealed Re:Verse Resident Evil, a new multiplayer spin-off, and showed an old trailer for upcoming CGI Netflix series Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness, which stars Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield in a fresh story set a couple of years after Resi 4. Re:Verse looks to be a competitive multiplayer shooter where you can play as various characters from throughout the Resident Evil series. Its visuals have a comic book-style effect, and it is being beta tested now. From the footage shown, it still needs a bit of work. There’s no word on a release date, but if you buy Resident Evil Village then you’ll get it free. Finally, Resident Evil is getting a crossover with The Division 2. Look for Resi items in Ubisoft’s online shooter starting on 2nd February, including Leon’s Raccoon City cop outfit.\n","wordCount":"1191","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mazie Pugh"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/everything-announced-in-capcom-s-resident-evil-showcase/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Everything Announced In Capcom S Resident Evil Showcase</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-27 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 27, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1191 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Mazie Pugh</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>It also included an announcement of Resident Evil 4 VR for Oculus Quest 2, a quick look at Village&rsquo;s Mercenaries mode, a new trailer for the Netflix CGI series Infinite Darkness, and some other smaller bits and pieces.
