We also know that it’s possible to add Mew, the original mythical Pokémon to your Galar Pokédex. Be warned - this guide does contain spoilers for the story-line of Pokémon Sword and Shield, so read it at your peril. On this page: In its weakened state, Zacain is a fairy-type Pokémon, but when it holds the Rusted Sword, which you find in the Slumbering Weald, it will become a fairy and steel-type Pokémon. This Rusted Sword becomes the fancy blade, which it holds in its mouth. Categorised as the Warrior Pokémon, Zacain has the ability, Intrepid Sword, which gives its attack a boost at the beginning of a battle. Zacain is a Pokémon that is all about attacking its enemies; using moves that have enough force to quickly, and easily, knock out their opponents. This makes it ideal for trainers who prefer focusing on powerful moves or interesting dual-type Pokémon. One of Zacain’s Pokédex entries supports its image as a fierce warrior, who prefers the offence, describing it as: ‘Known as a legendary hero, this Pokémon absorbs metal particles, transforming them into a weapon it uses to battle.’ While Zacain comes to your aid in the battle with Eternatus, you can’t catch it until the post-game in Pokémon Sword. This wolf-life legendary Pokémon is shrouded in mystery, through it’s been described as: ‘Zacian’s attacks are so graceful that its movements captivate opponents. Holding what appears to be a sword in its mouth, Zacain’s shining blade can cut through anything.’ At first, Zamazenta will appear to be a fighting-type Pokémon, giving it the Rusted Shield, which you find the Slumbering Weald, however, will transform into a fighting and steel-type Pokémon. Unlike Zacian, who focuses on attack, Zamazenta is a being that prefers defensive tactics; the Rusted Shield fusing into its body. Zamazenta knows the Dauntless Shield ability, which boosts its defence stat at the beginning of a battle. While Zamazenta is more focused upon defensive tactics, the combination of fighting and steel-type allows it to be a formidable fighter in its own fight. Trained properly, you can use Zamazenta to quickly defeat your opponents, utilising its defensive strength to ensure it takes as little damage as possible. In Pokémon Shield, Zamazenta will fight by your side during the battle with Eternatus and you’ll be able to catch it in the post-game episode. The knowledge of Zamazenta has been lost in time in the Galar region. Even though the knowledge of Zamazenta has been lost in time in the Galar region, this legendary wolf is described as: ‘With majestic movements and what appears to be a shield covering its body, Zamazenta can turn back any attack and overwhelm any opponents that dare face it.’ Categorised as a Gigantic Pokémon, Eternatus is a dragon and poison-type Pokémon. It’s origins are described as, ‘It was inside a meteorite that fell 20,000 years ago. There seems to be a connection between this Pokémon and the Dynamax phenomenon.’ This connection to the Dynamax phenomenon is certainly true, as you find yourself battling it in its Dynamax form. To defeat, and capture, Eternatus, you must call upon the assistance of both Zacain and Zamazenta, fighting alongside whichever legendary is exclusive to your edition. After a long battle, you’ll be able to add Eternatus to your Pokédex. With it finally in the wild, here’s how to start the Crown Tundra DLC and our full Pokémon Crown Tundra walkthrough. Plus, here’s how to catch Calyrex, Glastrier and Spectrier, the Regieleki and Regidrago puzzle solution and Regirock, Regice, Registeel locations, details on how to catch Legendary Birds Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres in the Crown Tundra, the Ultra Beasts and Necrozma adventure, Dynamax Adventures, including the legendries you can catch on these adventures, and the new Crown Tundra Pokédex and returning Pokémon explained. For Isle of Armor players, here’s how to find the Slowpoke, where to find Max Mushroom locations, and how to get Kubfu, become best friends and evolve it, plus all Diglett locations too!\rFor the base game, here’s info on the ability to transfer Pokémon to Pokémon Home, the Wild Area, lists of all TM locations and TRs, all Galarian forms and finally our main Pokémon Sword and Shield walkthrough for the whole game.\rIn The Isle of Armor, you’ll be gifted Kubfu - the fighting-type Legendary Pokémon. With careful training, you’ll be able to evolve it into Urshifu. What makes this evolution unique, however, is that Kubfu can evolve into different styles of Urshifu - Single Strike Style and Rapid Strike Style. The Urshifu styles are differentiated by both their type and which stats they focus on. Single Strike Style Urshifu is a fighting and dark-type Pokémon, which more suited towards trainers who prefer offensive strategies. Meanwhile, the Rapid Strike Style Urshifu is a defence focused Pokémon, which is a dual fighting and water-type Pokémon. During your adventure in The Crown Tundra, you may encounter Calyrex. Hundreds of years ago, this Pokémon ruled over Galar as it’s king. Not much is known about this Legendary Pokémon at the moment, but one thing we do know is that it has the ability to see every past, present and future event. The Crown Tundra surprised everyone by including two, previous unseen, legendary Pokémon - Glastrier and Spectrier. These two legendary Pokémon are the legendary mounts of Calyrex and you’ll be able to help it regain only one during your adventures in the Crown Tundra. Spectrier is a ghost-type Pokémon, while Glastrier is an ice-type and both have two forms - one wearing Calyrex is riding them and one without. The Crown Tundra DLC also sees the introduction of two new legendary Pokémon to the Regi family - Regieleki and Regidrago. Regieleki is an electric-type Pokémon that has been forced to wear insulation equipment by the ancient people of Galar. It’s believed that this equipment was forced to restrain and torment Regieleki. Regidrago is, as the name suggests, a dragon-type Pokémon, which is made out crystals that Regigigas filled with dragon energy. Unfortunately, Regigigas run out of crystals while making Regidrago, which meant that it could only make the head. This has led to the belief that, if it’s body was completed, Regidrago will bring destruction to the Galar region. The Crown Tundra also sees the introduction of the Galarian versions of the legendary birds Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres. It includes the new co-op mode, Dynamax Adventures, which will allow you to catch a variety of legendary Pokémon from across all the Pokémon generation, from Mewtwo to Lunala. Below you can find the full list of legendary Pokémon that can only be caught in Dynmax Adventures, it should be noted that a number of these Pokémon are version exclusives and will only appear in either Sword or Shield:\nMewtwo Raikou Entei Suicune Lugia Ho-Oh Latias Latios Kyogre Groudon Rayquaza Uxie Mesprit Azelf Dialga Palkia Heatran Giratina Cresselia Tornadus Thundurus Reshiram Zekrom Landorus Kyurem Xerneas Yveltal Zygarde Tapu Koko Tapu Lele Tapu Bulu Tapu Fini Solgaleo Lunala\nYou may also find yourself fighting an Ultra Beasts in Pokémon Sword and Shield. Finally, you can also discover a number of other legendary Pokémon hiding in the Crown Tundra, including the Swords of Justice quartet (Cobalion, Terrakion, Virizion and Keldeo), the original three Regis (Regirock, Regice and Registeel), Regigigas and Cosmog. Elsewhere, there are Mythical Pokémon. Following Sword and Shield’s release is the arrival of Zarude, the ‘Rogue Monkey’ with a Dark / Grass typing. At launch, we also had access to Mew - the first mythical Pokémon to appear in the series - which you could get by transferring it from a new Poké Ball Plus.\n","wordCount":"1290","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-20T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Wayne Wise"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/pok-mon-sword-and-shield-legendaries-zacian-zamazenta-and-eternatus-explained/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Pok Mon Sword And Shield Legendaries Zacian Zamazenta And Eternatus Explained</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 20, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1290 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Wayne Wise</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>Now that Pokémon Sword and Shield have been released, we&rsquo;ve been introduced to the mysterious Eternatus.
