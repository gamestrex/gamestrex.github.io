Otherwise… crack on!\rOn this page: Civilization: Cree Leader: Poundmaker Cree Unique Ability - Nîhithaw: Gain +1 Trade Route capacity and a free Trader when you research Pottery. When a Trader moves into an unclaimed tile within three tiles of a Cree city, that city claims those tiles. Cree Unique Unit - Okihtcitaw: Recon unit replacing the Scout, which takes slightly longer to produce but has double the combat strength and starts with one free promotion. Cree Unique Infrastructure - Mekewap: Unique tile improvement that must be built next to a Bonus or Luxury Resource. Grants +1 Production, +1 Housing, +1 Gold for every adjacent Luxury resource, +1 Food for every two adjacent Bonus resources and another +1 Food for each adjacent Bonus resource with the Conservation Civic, and another +1 Gold for every two adjacent Luxury resources with the Cartography technology, and +1 Production and +1 Housing after getting Civil Service. Poundmaker Unique Ability - Favourable Terms: All Alliances provide Shared Visibility, and Trade Routes grant +1 Food in the starting city and +1 Gold in the receiving city per Camp or Pasture in that receiving city. Poundmaker Tips:\nWhen playing as Poundmaker: Built around Trade, alliances and early exploration, Poundmaker is a flexible leader that benefits from peacetime, and dovetails well with City-States like Geneva that grant peacetime bonuses, too. With a quick, peaceful start provided by your early Trade Routes and Mekewap you should rush Pottery first, then use that bonus Food, Production, Gold and Housing to go whatever direction you like, although citizen-based Victory types like Science probably work best, given your potential for rapid growth. When playing against Poundmaker: Looting Trade Routes is an obvious one, seeing as Poundmaker will likely have a huge number of them early on. AI Poundmakers tend to rapidly expand in the early game whilst avoiding war with other Civs. If you can block that by playing aggressively against them early on - whist being wary of their empowered recon units - you should come out on top.\nCivilization: Netherlands Leader: Wilhelmina Dutch Unique Ability - Grote Rivieren: Rivers provide +2 adjacency bonuses for Campuses, Theatre Squares, and Industrial Zones, and building a Hardbor provides a culture bomb, claiming surrounding tiles. Dutch Unique Unit - De Zeven Provinciën: Renaissance Era ranged naval unit with increased Combat Strength and Ranged Strength, and a +7 bonus Combat Strength when attacking districts with defences. Dutch Unique Infrastructure - Polder: Tile improvement that must be built on Coast or Lake tiles with at least three adjacent land tiles without hills or mountains. Grants +1 Food and Production, +1 Food for every adjacent Polder, +0.5 Housing, +4 Gold with Civil Engineering, +2 more Food and +1 more Production with Replacable Parts, and increases the movement cost of the tile to 3. Wilhelmina Unique Ability - Radio Oranje: Your Trade Routes between your own cities grant +1 Loyalty per tern to the starting city, and Trade Routes to or from foreign cities provide +1 Culture to the Dutch. Wilhelmina Tips:\nWhen playing as Wilhelmina: Wilhelmina is very much built around coastal and naval play. Ideally you want to find a place for multiple Poulders - lakes tend to work well, as do cove-like areas on the coast - to get their bonuses stacking, and then start living the Renaissance Era dream by trading as much as possible and dominating the seas. Merchant Republic is an important Government type, and you should of course set up as many bonuses between Harbours, Commercial Hubs, Industrial Zones and nearby rivers as you can. From there, Production and Gold should be plentiful and you’re free to find the victory that suits you. When playing against Wilhelmina: She gets a major power spike in the mid game, where Gold and Production incomes can skyrocket in Harbours and Commercial hubs and trading begins to boom, so it’s important to try and restrict Wilhelmina in the early game. If you spot her early, grab coastal and river-based settlements as quick as you can, and denying her trade will slow down her Culture income if she’s in the way of your Culture Victory.\nCivilization: Georgia Leader: Tamar Georgia Unique Ability - Strength in Unity: When making a Dedication at the beginning of a Golden Age, you also gain the Normal Age versions bonus towards earning Era Points as well as the Golden Age bonus. Georgia Unique Unit - Khevsur: Medieval Era melee unit that gains both +7 Combat Strength and no movememnt penalty when in hilly terrain. Georgia Unique Infrastructure - Tsikhe: City Centre building that replaces Renissance Walls. It’s built faster than the regular walls and grants +3 Faith, +50 Outer Defense Strength, as well as +3 Housing when you have the Monarchy Government active, and +3 Tourism with Conservation. Like regular walls it’s rendered obsolte with the research of Steel. Tamar Unique Ability - Glory of the World, Kingdom and Faith: +100% Faith earned for 10 turns after declaring a Protectorate War, and each Envoy sent to a city-state that follows your religion as a majority counts as two Envoys. TamarTips:\nWhen playing as Tamar: Tamar is religiously enclined, although the Strength in Unity civ bonus grants her a fair amount of flexibility with the bonuses aqcuired, and more easily earned, from repeat Golden Ages. Aim to get that first one up and running and hopefully the rest will follow, ideally. Otherwise, converting and then allying with city-states is a decent way to earn a chance at a Protectorate War, which can then earn you more Faith in the process - that you can then put into converting more civs and city-states! When playing against Tamar: Fighting city-states might play into her hand if she’s already their Suzerain, but wiping them out early on will take away a pillar of her strategy - or if you can double-down on allying with them yourself that’ll slow her down, too.\nCivilization: India (second leader) Leader: Chandragupta India Unique Ability - Dharma: Receives Follower Belief bonuses in a city from each Religion that has at least 1 follower. India Unique Unit - Varu: Classical era mounted unit. Replaces Horseman, has 2 movement and 40 melee attack. Inflicts -5 Combat Strength on all adjacent enemy units. IndiaUnique Infrastructure - Stepwell: Tile imrpvoement. Bestows +1 Food and +1 Housing. +1 Faith is adjacent to a Holy Site (another +1 with Feudalism). +1 additional Food if adjacent to a Farm, and another +1 with Professional Sports, +1 more Housing, too, with Sanitation. Cannot be built on Hills or adjacent to another Stepwell. Chandragupta Unique Ability - Arthashastra: When you unlock the Military Training Civic you can then declare a War of Territorial Expansion,\rand after declaring a War of Terrirorial Expansion your units gain +2 Movement and +5 Combat Strength for the first 10 turns. Chandragupta Tips:\nWhen playing as Chandragupta: An agressive expansionist, Chandragupta is all about rushing Military Training and getting to war early. Stepwells are excellent in the early game, although aside from the bonus housing they fall off in the mid to late game after Feudalism is unlocked - use these to achieve rapid early to mid-game city growth. The Varu, meanwhile, is your route to early domination that you can carry on to a late-game victory. When playing against Chandragupta: Anti-cavalry units will be important, and while you’ll be heading straight to war if you’re nearby thanks to his agenda that favours war with neighbours, if you spawn further away from him you should still make preparations. The good news is that Chandragupta doesn’t have any innate boosts to Production or Gold available, so it’s possible to out sustain him in war or accelerate past him in other areas, too.\nCivilization: Korea Leader: Seondeok Korea Unique Ability - Three Kingdoms: Mines receive +1 Science if there is an adjacent Seowon district, and Farms receive bonus Food if there’s an adjacent Seowon. Korea Unique Unit - Hwacha: Renaissance Era ranged unit with high Ranged strength, but cannot move and attack in the same turn. Korea Unique Infrastructure - Seowon: A Science-based district that replaces the Campus, with a faster time to build, and that must be built on hills. Grants +4 Science, but -1 Science for each adjacent District, including the City Centre. Specialists here add +2 Science each, and provides +1 Great Scientist point per turn. Seondeok Unique Ability - Hwarang: +10% Culture and +10% Science in all cities with an established Governor. Seondeok Tips:\nWhen playing as Seondeok: Your Seowons are of course the thing you should be prioritising with Korea, and should be rushed as soon as possible. Combining them with some surrounding flat land for farms and hills for mines will give your city a nice balance of sustained growth and Production, but they can also be more specialised if you have a particularly flat or hilly city in mind. With that, and the Governor Pingala’s Researcher promotion that boosts the speed at which you can construct Campus-based buildings in the city, and the Hwarang bonus, you should be well on your way to a Science-rush victory. When playing against Seondeok: Warfare can be disruptive to Seondeok’s early Science rush, as she’ll be forced to prioritise military units and production over growth and Science. Beware of that mid-game powerhouse the Hwacha though - if it sets up before you can get to melee range it can pick off other mid-game units with ease.\nCivilization: Mapuche Leader: Lautaro Mapuche Unique Ability - Toqui: Units trained in cities with an established Governor gain 25% more experience in combat. All units receive +10 Combat Strength against civilizations that are in a Golden Age. Mapuche Unique Unit - Malón Raider: Renaissance Era light cavalry unit, that has +5 Combat Strength within 4 tiles of friendly territory and requires less Movement to pillage. Mapuche Unique Infrastructure - Chemamull: Tile improvement that must be built on a tile with an Appeal of Breathtaking (4 or above). Grants Culture equal to 75% of that tile’s Appeal Lautaro Unique Ability - Swift Hawk: If one of your units defeats an enemy unit within the borders of that enemy’s city, that city loses 20 Loyalty. Lautaro Tips:\nWhen playing as Lautaro: Lautaro is combat-focused, although his unique structure the Chemamull is an excellent source of Culture and late-game Tourism after researching Flight, so his combat bonuses are best spent sculpting, and then defending, his own borders - especially in the mid-game where his Malón Raiders are at their most effective. Identify the cities you want to capture or the land you want to claim, and once you’re happy with your land (which should be high in appeal), dig in. Aiming for the Eiffel Tower wonder, which boosts the Tourism output of your Chemamulls via boosting their tiles’ appeal, is a great bet. When playing against Lautaro: For one, beware conflict with Lautaro when you’re in a Golden Age, as the +10 Combat Strength bonus his units get will seriously affect the conflict. Otherwise, pipping him to the Eiffel Tower will make a dent in his Tourism - or at least prevent it getting out of hand in the late game - and combining the Governors Victor and Amani if your borders are close to Lautaro will help fend off the threat of conquest and revolt.\nCivilization: Mongolia Leader: Genghis Khan Mongolia Unique Ability - Örtöö: Starting a Trade Route creates a Trading Post in the destination city instantly, rather than on completion. You receive an extra level of Diplomatic Visibility for possessing a TRading Post in any city of a civilization, and Mongolian units gain +3 Combat Strength for each level of Diplomatic Visibility on their opponent. Mongolia Unique Unit - Keshig: A Medieval Era mounted ranged unit, with a ranged unit promotion table, but 4 Movement range. Shares its movement range with all units in a formation if it forms one. Mongolia Unique Infrastructure - Ordu: Ancient Era Encampment building, replcaing the Stable. Provides +1 Production, +1 Housing, +1 Citizen slot, +1 Great General point per turn, +25% combat experience for all light and heavy cavalry units trained there, and +1 Movement for all cavalry units trained in that city. Genghis Khan Unique Ability - Mongol Horde: All cavalry class units gain +3 Combat strength, and defeating enemy cavalry class units gives you a chance to capture that unit instead of destroying it. Genghis Khan Tips:\nWhen playing as Genghis Khan: Predictably, Genghis Khan is all about massing your cavalry and securing a sweeping Domination Victory.\rHis bonuses line up perfectly and simply: trade with other civs to set up Trading Posts and gain Diplomatic Visibility, then build Ordu structures, train cavalry of all kinds, and lob them at whoever you want, because you’ll probably win. In the early to mid game he’s an absolute machine, particularly when you start capturing units for free too - and in the late game you’ll probably have captured enough cities to be well ahead of the pack anyway. When playing against Genghis Khan: Anti-cavalry units are essential, but the issue will be with his Keshig archers, which require anti-ranged units like cavalry themselves - but your cavalry are succeptible to conversion if they get defeated, which can quickly add up against you. It can be beneficial to go to war with him early, before he gains Diplomatic Visibility of you through Trade Routes. Otherwise, if you can gain a Scientific advantage, progressing past the Medieval era will alow you to more safely utilise anti-cavalry units without his Keshigs being such a threat.\nCivilization: Scotland Leader: Robert the Bruce Scotland Unique Ability - Scottish Enlightenment: Happy cities receive +5% Science and +5% Production, along with generating +1 Great Scientist point per Campush and +1 Great Engineer point per Industrial Zone. Ecstatic cities double all of the above, to 10% bonuses and +2 points each. Scotland Unique Unit - Highlander: Industrial Era recon unit with additional Combat and Ranged Strength, and another +5 Combat Strength in Hills and Woods. Scotland Unique Infrastructure - Golf Course: Tile improvement that cannot be placed on Desert or Desert Hill tiles, and limited at one per city. Provides +1 Amenity, +2 Gold, +1 Appeal, +1 Culture if adjacent to a City Center, +1 Culture if adjacent to an Entertainment Complex, and +1 Housing with Globalization. Robert the Bruce Unique Ability - Bannockburn: After researching the Defensive Tactics Civic, instead of the Diplomatic Service Civic, you can declare a War of Liberation. +100% Production and +2 Movement for the first 10 turns after declaring one. Robert the Bruce Tips:\nWhen playing as Robert the Bruce: Robert is highly flexible, with his various Science, Production and Great Person bonuses making him great at rushing Wonders and achieving a progress advantage over other civs, whilst he can leap to war to defend his allies early on with War of Liberation. The best way to play then is as a peaceful, productive civ that’s able to defend itself if there’s any impending threat. When playing against Robert the Bruce: For starters, don’t go to war with any of his friends or allies unless you want to fight him too.\rOtherwise, be wary of his rapid acquisition of Great People - if they’re ones you’re after and you can’t match him head-on, consider patronage, as Robert receives no major bonuses to Gold or, in particular, Faith. The longer he goes on unchallenged in military terms, the stronger he’ll get and more he’ll be able to snowball his Science and Production yields.\nCivilization: Zulu Leader: Shaka Zulu Unique Ability - Isibongo: Cities that have a garrisoned unit get +3 Loyalty per turn or +5 if it’s a Corps or Army there. Units that conquer a city are automatically upgraded into a Corps or Army if you have the Civic unlocked for them. Zulu Unique Unit - Impi: Medieval anti cavalry unit replacing the Pikeman. Faster to produce, and lower maintenance cost, with increased bonus for Flanking and faster XP gains. Zulu Unique Infrastructure - Ikanda: District replacing the Encampment. GRants +1 Great General point per turn, +1 Housing, +1 Production and Cultre from specialists, all the other usual aspects of an Encampment as well as the ability to train Corps and Armies without building the Military Academy, and grants +25% faster training of Corps and Armies. Shaka Unique Ability - Amabutho: You can form Corps from the Mercenaries Civic and Armies from the Nationalism Civic, rather than them unlocking later on. Extra +5 Combat Strength to both Corps and Armies. Shaka Tips:\nWhen playing as Shaka: The obviosu focus of Shaka is military Domination Victories, via the use of massed units in Corps and Armies. Rushing Encampments, as well as Mercenaries and Nationalism Civics down the line, will let you rapidly sweep through enemy cities and build up some huge numbers of adjacent, stacked units. Try to time capturing cities for after you get one of those Civics if you’re close to unlocking them, as the free Corps or Armies makes a major difference. When playing against Shaka: If you’re nearby, expect to be attacked fairly soon. Ranged units will work best, as your cavalry will struggle against his amassed Impi. If you’re further away, progressing past the Medieval era will lower the impact of those Impi, but by then he may have more Corps and Armies amassing, too.\nIf your lust for Civilization 6 knowledge is still going strong, expansion owners should take a look at our Civ 6 Rise and Fall guide hub which takes you through the basics of everything new, whilst we have dedicated pages on Governors and Loyalty, along with how to earn Golden Ages, Era Points and Era Score through Historic Moments, and a full list of new Civs in Civ 6 Rise and Fall and other DLC. Otherwise, our Civilization 6 guide, tips and tricks covers the essentials before you master early game, mid-game and late-game strategies. We also have tips on the new Districts feature, a Leaders list with their Traits and Agendas, plus the best ways to get Gold, Science, and Faith, how to win by Religious Victory, and how to earn the elusive Science Victory and Military domination victory. Finally, here’s the Culture Victory, Foreign Tourism, and Domestic Tourism explained in depth. DLC Pack: Pre-order bonus or Aztec Civilization Pack Civilization: Aztec Leader: Montezuma Aztec Unique Ability- Legend of the Five Suns: Spend Builder charges to complete 20% of the original district charge. Aztec Unique Unit - Eagle Warrior: Ancient era melee unit. Has a chance to capture other civilization’s military units by turning them into builders. Replaces the Warrior. Aztec Unique Infrastructure - Tlachtli: +2 Faith, +1 Amenity from entertainment, +1 Great General point per turn. Replaces Arena. Montezuma Unique Ability - Gifts for the Tlatoani: Luxury resources in his territory provide an Amenity to 2 extra cities. Military units receive +1 Combat Strength for each different Luxury resource improved in Aztec lands. Montezuma Tips: When playing as Montezuma: Bigger is better when playing as Montezuma. Expand territory in order to claim as many luxury resources as possible for the boost they provide to both Amenities and unit Combat Strength. Use Eagle Warrirors as much as possible in the early game to capture enemy units and turn them into Builders to harvest those luxury resources and also speed the production of districts. If such expansion requires war, so be it. Montezuma is well equipped for war in the early game and the additional Amenities provided by luxury resources will not only boost Combat Strength but also offset any population unrest of the war waging around their ears. When playing against Montezuma, be aware of his agenda: Tlatoani. Montezuma likes civilizations that have the same luxury resources as he does, so that he doesn’t feel like he’s missing out. He dislikes civilizations that have luxury resources that he doesn’t have.\nDLC Pack: Poland Civilization and Scenario Pack Civilization: Poland Leader: Jadwiga Pland Unique Ability - Golden Liberty: When Poland completes an Encampment or Fort inside friendly territory, it gains adjacent tiles, even if they belong to another Civ. Also, one of Poland’s Military Policy slots is converted to a Wildcard Policy slot. Poland Unique Unit - Winged Hussar: Medieval era cavalry unit. When attacking, if it does more damage than the defending enemy, it pushes them back one tile. If they can’t move back, it does additional damage. Poland Unique Infrastructure - Sukiennice: Replaces the Market. +3 Gold, +1 Citizen, +1 Great Merchant Point-per-turn, +4 Gold from domestic Trade Routes, +2 Production from international Trade Routes. Jadwiga Unique Ability - Lithuanian Union: When using the Golden Liberty ‘culture bomb’ to gain territory from another Civ’s city, it will convert that city to her Religion. Relics also produce +4 Gold, +2 Culture, +2 Faith, and Holy Site districts gain additional adjacency bonuses. Jadwiga Tips:\nWhen playing as Jadwiga: Although there’s seemingly an emphasis on Faith generation with Poland and Jadwiga, they’re actually surprisingly flexible. Additional Gold and Production from various sources means that playing a ‘wide’ game - with lots of cities spread out early on - is made far more easy, whilst the conversion of a Military Policy to a Wildcard Policy can be very helpful for adapting to the game at hand. Couple that with the displacement abilities of both the Winged Hussar and the return of the ‘culture bomb’, and Jadwiga’s Poland is all about expansion. When playing against Jadwiga: Generate lots of Faith to avoid getting into a conflict with her - or at least delay the inevitable. Her agenda, Saint, sees her try to build up lots of Faith herself, and look favourably on others who do the same. Regardless, against an AI Jadwiga you’ll likely soon find available land disappearing, and a rival Civ with a huge population at their disposal thanks to her ability to expand. Make sure you have enough resources and diversified cities as soon as possible to counter her, and keep a strong military to hand to deal with those mid-game Winged Hussars.\nDLC Pack: Australia Civilization and Scenario Pack Civilization: Australia Leader: John Curtin Australia Unique Ability - Land Down Under: +3 Housing in coastal cities. Building a Pasture triggers a Cultre Bomb, claiming surrounding tiles. Campuses, Commercial Hubs, Holy Sites and Theatre Squares gain +1 to yields in tiles with Charming Appeal and +3 to those with Breathtaking Appeal.\rAustralia Unique Unit - Digger: Modern Era Melee Unit that replaces the Infantry. 72 Combat Strength, +10 Combat Strength on Coastal Tiles,\r+5 outside Australian territory, and requires no resources to build. CIV Unique Infrastructure - Outback Station: Tile improvement that can’t be built on Snow or Tundra. Grants that tile +1 Food and Production;\r+0.5 Housing; +1 Food from every adjacent Pasture, +1 Production from every 2 adjacent Outback Stations when you research Steam Power and +1 Food from every 2 adjacent Outback Stations when you research Rapid Deployment. John Curtin Unique Ability - Citadel of Civilization: Gain +100% Production if you have received a declaration of war in the past 10 turns,\ror if you’ve liberated a city in the past 20 turns. John Curtin Tips:\nWhen playing as John Curtin: Your combat is going to be greatly boosted around coastal cities thanks to Diggers. Raiding others is particularly strong thanks to the additional +5 bonus for non-Australian territory combat, and then taking those cities will grant you the +3 housing bonus from Land Down Under. That’ll probably stack with the additional Appeal normally found in coastal areas, meaning coastal cities is the way forward, and making Australia one of the strongest options for more ocean-heavy map types, too. When playing against John Curtin: Avoiding coastal combat is the obvious one, and you should note that they don’t get any specific boosts to naval warfare. If you can protect your cities from the sea, then ranged units will do well to protect them from the melee-class Diggers on the land,\rwhether you’re attacking or defending. Otherwise if you know you’re near to them, making a land-grab for the decent coastal tiles nearby will help minimise their stacking bonuses, too.\nDLC Pack: Persia and Macedon Civilization and Scenario Pack Civilization: Persia Leader: Cyrus Persia Unique Ability - Satrapies: +1 Trade Route capacity when you unlock the Political Philosophy civic. +2 Gold and +1 Culture from routes between your own cities. Roads built in your territory are one level more advanced than usual. Persia Unique Unit - Immortal: A strange unit that is both melee class, with strong melee defence, but with a ranged attack that’s stronger than the Archer’s but has the same attack range. Replaces the Swordsman (has slightly lower Melee strength) and upgrades directly to the Musketman. Persia Unique Infrastructure - Pairidaeza: Tile improvement that can’t be built on Tundra or Snow. Grants +1 Culture, +2 Gold, +2 Appeal on a tile plus +1 Culture for every adjacent Holy Site and Theatre Square, +1 Culture after unlocking Diplomatic Service and +1 Gold for every adjacent Commercial Hub and City Centre. Cyrus Unique Ability - Fall of Babylon: +2 Movement for the first 10 turns after you declare a Surprise War. No penalties to yields in occupied cities, and Surprise Wars only count as Formal Wars in terms of warmongering and war weariness penalties. Cyrus Tips:\nWhen playing as Cyrus: Cyrus is geared towards fast, early-game conquest. The fact that occupied cities will act as normal, coupled with the added trade routes you’ll likely unlock as you go and the Satrapies bonus will likely stack nicely. In short: rush Immortals, stack them up and declare a Surprise War, then get rolling. When playing against Cyrus: For one, never trust him, whether it’s AI or a real player, as his entire setup is geared not only towards warfare but surprise warfare. Immortals have better melee strength than normal Archers but are still weaker than regular melee units, so cavalry is a good bet for steamrolling them. He’ll also have naturally high Culture thanks to Satrapies and Pairidaeza, making Tourism-based victories difficult against him.\nDLC Pack: Persia and Macedon Civilization and Scenario Pack Civilization: Macedonia Leader: Alexander the Great Macedonia Unique Ability - Hellenistic Fusion: receive a Eureka boost for each Encampment or Campus in a city when you conquer it, and an Inspiration for each Holy Site or Theatre Square. Macedonia Unique Unit - Hypaspist: Melee unit that replaces the Swordsman, but doesn’t require Iron. +5 Combat Strength then beseiging a district and +50% support bonuses. Macedonia Unique Infrastructure - Basilikoi Paides: Encampment building replacing the Barracks. Grants +1 Production, Housing, Great General point per turn and and Citizen slot. +25% combat experience for all melee and ranged land units and Hetairoi trained in this city. Gain Science equal to 25%\rof the unit’s cost when a non-civilian unit is created in this city. Alexander Unique Ability - To the World’s End: Cities don’t acquire war weariness. All military units heal completely when this player captures a city with a world wonder. Alexander Unique Unit - Hetairoi: Heavy cavalry unit that replaces the Horseman. +5 Combat Strength when adjacent to a Great General (on top of the usual bonus); +5 Great General points from kills. Starts with a free promotion and does not require Horses to build. Alexander the Great Tips:\nWhen playing as Alexander: Alexander is, predictably, compeltely focused on securing a Domination victory. You need to be thinking about this from the outset, as his power spike is in the classical era where he can have two unique, and powerful, units together at one time, whilst still receiving Science for building them in Basilikoi and more Science and Culture progress from conquering cities. Basically, start a war early and don’t stop. When playing against Alexander: Good luck! Early game you’ll need some Archers and some anti-cavalry like Spearmen as soon as possible if you start near Alexander. AI Alexanders will almost never surrender or make peace with you, and it’s unlikely human opponents will either. If you’re far away, it might be worth conquering some nearby cities too and making sure you have a number of Encampments dotted around to defend yourself. Gaining supremacy in terms of technology, and thus the air and sea, can also make a difference - both of his unique units are early-game and land-based.\nDLC Pack: Nubia Civilization and Scenario Pack Civilization: Nubia Leader: Amanitore Nubia Unique Ability - Ta-Seti: +50% Production towards Ranged units and all Ranged units gain +50% combat experience. Mines over strategic resoruces provide +1 Production, and Mines over bonus and luxury resources provide +2 Gold. Nubia Unique Unit - Pítati Archer: Ranged unit replacing the Archer. Slightly higher Production cost to build, but higher Combat Strength and Ranged Strength, and one extra movement speed. Nubia Unique Infrastructure - Nubian Pyramid: Tile improvement that must be built on Desert or Floodplain tiles. Grants +1 Faith, plus +1 Food if adjacent to a City Centre, +1 Science if adjacent to a Campus, +1 Gold if adjacent to a Commercial Hub or Hardor, +1 Faith if adjacent to a Holy Site, +1 Production if adjacent to an Industrial Zone and +1 Culture if adjacent to a Theatre Square. Amanitore Unique Ability - Kandake of Meroë: +20% Production in all districts, or +40% if the city contains a Nubian Pyramid adjacent to the City Centre. Amanitore Tips:\nWhen playing as Amanitore: The boosts to Production and Gold from various sources make Amanitore and Nubia a strong military-focuses Civ,\rbut likewise the Nubian Pyramid’s diverse bonuses, and various applications of high Production in your cities - like building Wonders or Space Race Projects - means that Nubia is a very flexible Civ too, with the boosted ranged units and Archers available as a nice defensive buffer against more expansionist leaders. When playing against Amanitore: The good news is that a lot of Amanitore’s benefits come from being near desert tiles for her Nubian Pyramids, which restricts her significantly. If you’re nearby, making a land grab for a good desert spot can help, as can beating her to desert and Production-focused Wonders like the Pyramids or Ruhr Valley. Cavalry is the way to beat her Archers, although be wary of their extra movement!\nDLC Pack: Khmer and Indonesia Civilization and Scenario Pack Civilization: Khmer Leader: Jayavarman VII Khmer Unique Ability - Grand Barays: +3 Faith and +1 Amenity from entertainment to each city with an Aquaduct, plus Farms provide +2 Food if adjacent to an Aqueduct. Khmer Unique Unit - Domrey: Siege unit, stronger than a catapult and deals Bombard Damage, and can move as well as attack in one turn and exerts zone of crontrol. Khmer Unique Infrastructure - Prasat: Holy Site building that replaces the Temple. Grants +4 Faith, doubled with the Simultaneum Policy, plus +1 Citizen slot, +1 Great Prophet point per turn, and +2 Relic slots. Allowes purchasing of Apostles and Inquisitors and also Missionaries purchased in a city with a Prasat gain the Martyr promotion. Jayavarman VII Unique Ability - Monasteries of the King: Holy Sites provide +2 Food and +1 Housing if placed on a river, and Holy Sites trigger a culture bomb, letting you grab land tiles around it. Jayavarman VII Tips:\nWhen playing as Jayavarman VII: Jayavarman VII is a weird one, focusing on a combination of high citizen growth and religious bonuses -particularly in terms of Relic-based Tourism - as well has having a handy mid-game siege unit available. Focus on citizen growth and religion in the early game, rushing Aquaducts when you can and placing Farms nearby - this works especially well if you can settle near a river and mountain, where the bonuses will stack up. Then, holy wars will grant you a flow of Relics if you lose Missionaries, and your large base of citizens will benefit from per-citizen religious bonuses, too. You’re flexible in terms of victory type from this point, as the sustainable, high population can be put to various uses. When playing against Jayavarman VII: Although the Domrey is a useful siege unit, Jayavarman VII doesn’t really get any other defensive benefits from his bonuses, so an early rush to conquer his cities will certainly help. Letting him quickly spread to claim river-based cities and convert your own cities unapposed will be an issue - so you may want to think about having a strong, offensive Religion of your own.\nDLC Pack: Khmer and Indonesia Civilization and Scenario Pack Civilization: Indonesia Leader: Gitarja Indonesia Unique Ability - Great Nusantara: Coast and Lake tiles grant minor adjacency bonuses for Holy Site, Campus, Industrial Zone and Theatre Square districts Indonesia Unique Unit - Jong: Ranged naval unit replacing the Frigate. Slightly higher production cost but an extra point of movement speed,\rand +5 Combat strength when in formation, and shares its movement speed with all units in that formation. Indonesia Unique Infrastructure - Kampung: Tile improvement that must be built on Coast or Lake tiles adjacent to sea resources. Grants +1 Production and Housing, +1 Food from every adjacent Fishing Boat, and +1 Housing with Mass Production, +1 Production with Civil Engineering, and +1 Tourism from every bonus Food with Flight. Gitarja Unique Ability - Exalted Goddess of the Three Worlds: Naval units can be purchased with Faith, and Religious units don’t lose movement for embarking or disembarking. +2 Faith to City Centres that are adjacent to Coast or Lake tiles. Gitarja Tips:\nWhen playing as Gitarja: Gitarja is a leader best suited to two things: a religious playstyle, and an island-based map. The Jong is perfectly suited to accompanying your Settlers, dragging them up to their 5 Movement Speed, so you can rapidly expand your aquatic empire. You’ll also get a decent early Faith income just from founding those cities, and again your Faith units will be able to rapidly and safely move across bodies of water to spread your religion. Basically, expand fast and use that to your advantage as you progress! When playing against Gitarja: Gitarja is severely limited when playing on land-based maps, or if you can beat her to settling on the resource-rich coastal spots early on. The Jong, meanwhile, is a good unit for convoying settlers but hardly an intimidating one, with it being more about using its mobility against you than its brute strength. Likewise she gains a decent Faith income from her bonuses but her religious units’ bonuses are all built around naval mobility, rather than religious combat. Gitarja is also fairly weak to land-based domination if any of her cities are founded on larger chunks of land that you can reach on foot.

Civilization: Cree Leader: Poundmaker
Cree Unique Ability - Nîhithaw: Gain +1 Trade Route capacity and a free Trader when you research Pottery. When a Trader moves into an unclaimed tile within three tiles of a Cree city, that city claims those tiles. Cree Unique Unit - Okihtcitaw: Recon unit replacing the Scout, which takes slightly longer to produce but has double the combat strength and starts with one free promotion. Cree Unique Infrastructure - Mekewap: Unique tile improvement that must be built next to a Bonus or Luxury Resource. Grants +1 Production, +1 Housing, +1 Gold for every adjacent Luxury resource, +1 Food for every two adjacent Bonus resources and another +1 Food for each adjacent Bonus resource with the Conservation Civic, and another +1 Gold for every two adjacent Luxury resources with the Cartography technology, and +1 Production and +1 Housing after getting Civil Service. Poundmaker Unique Ability - Favourable Terms: All Alliances provide Shared Visibility, and Trade Routes grant +1 Food in the starting city and +1 Gold in the receiving city per Camp or Pasture in that receiving city.
Poundmaker Tips:</p><p>When playing as Poundmaker: Built around Trade, alliances and early exploration, Poundmaker is a flexible leader that benefits from peacetime, and dovetails well with City-States like Geneva that grant peacetime bonuses, too. With a quick, peaceful start provided by your early Trade Routes and Mekewap you should rush Pottery first, then use that bonus Food, Production, Gold and Housing to go whatever direction you like, although citizen-based Victory types like Science probably work best, given your potential for rapid growth. When playing against Poundmaker: Looting Trade Routes is an obvious one, seeing as Poundmaker will likely have a huge number of them early on. AI Poundmakers tend to rapidly expand in the early game whilst avoiding war with other Civs. If you can block that by playing aggressively against them early on - whist being wary of their empowered recon units - you should come out on top.</p><p>Civilization: Netherlands Leader: Wilhelmina
Dutch Unique Ability - Grote Rivieren: Rivers provide +2 adjacency bonuses for Campuses, Theatre Squares, and Industrial Zones, and building a Hardbor provides a culture bomb, claiming surrounding tiles. Dutch Unique Unit - De Zeven Provinciën: Renaissance Era ranged naval unit with increased Combat Strength and Ranged Strength, and a +7 bonus Combat Strength when attacking districts with defences. Dutch Unique Infrastructure - Polder: Tile improvement that must be built on Coast or Lake tiles with at least three adjacent land tiles without hills or mountains. Grants +1 Food and Production, +1 Food for every adjacent Polder, +0.5 Housing, +4 Gold with Civil Engineering, +2 more Food and +1 more Production with Replacable Parts, and increases the movement cost of the tile to 3. Wilhelmina Unique Ability - Radio Oranje: Your Trade Routes between your own cities grant +1 Loyalty per tern to the starting city, and Trade Routes to or from foreign cities provide +1 Culture to the Dutch.
Wilhelmina Tips:</p><p>When playing as Wilhelmina: Wilhelmina is very much built around coastal and naval play. Ideally you want to find a place for multiple Poulders - lakes tend to work well, as do cove-like areas on the coast - to get their bonuses stacking, and then start living the Renaissance Era dream by trading as much as possible and dominating the seas. Merchant Republic is an important Government type, and you should of course set up as many bonuses between Harbours, Commercial Hubs, Industrial Zones and nearby rivers as you can. From there, Production and Gold should be plentiful and you&rsquo;re free to find the victory that suits you. When playing against Wilhelmina: She gets a major power spike in the mid game, where Gold and Production incomes can skyrocket in Harbours and Commercial hubs and trading begins to boom, so it&rsquo;s important to try and restrict Wilhelmina in the early game. If you spot her early, grab coastal and river-based settlements as quick as you can, and denying her trade will slow down her Culture income if she&rsquo;s in the way of your Culture Victory.</p><p>Civilization: Georgia Leader: Tamar
Georgia Unique Ability - Strength in Unity: When making a Dedication at the beginning of a Golden Age, you also gain the Normal Age versions bonus towards earning Era Points as well as the Golden Age bonus. Georgia Unique Unit - Khevsur: Medieval Era melee unit that gains both +7 Combat Strength and no movememnt penalty when in hilly terrain. Georgia Unique Infrastructure - Tsikhe: City Centre building that replaces Renissance Walls. It&rsquo;s built faster than the regular walls and grants +3 Faith, +50 Outer Defense Strength, as well as +3 Housing when you have the Monarchy Government active, and +3 Tourism with Conservation. Like regular walls it&rsquo;s rendered obsolte with the research of Steel. Tamar Unique Ability - Glory of the World, Kingdom and Faith: +100% Faith earned for 10 turns after declaring a Protectorate War, and each Envoy sent to a city-state that follows your religion as a majority counts as two Envoys.
TamarTips:</p><p>When playing as Tamar: Tamar is religiously enclined, although the Strength in Unity civ bonus grants her a fair amount of flexibility with the bonuses aqcuired, and more easily earned, from repeat Golden Ages. Aim to get that first one up and running and hopefully the rest will follow, ideally. Otherwise, converting and then allying with city-states is a decent way to earn a chance at a Protectorate War, which can then earn you more Faith in the process - that you can then put into converting more civs and city-states! When playing against Tamar: Fighting city-states might play into her hand if she&rsquo;s already their Suzerain, but wiping them out early on will take away a pillar of her strategy - or if you can double-down on allying with them yourself that&rsquo;ll slow her down, too.</p><p>Civilization: India (second leader) Leader: Chandragupta
India Unique Ability - Dharma: Receives Follower Belief bonuses in a city from each Religion that has at least 1 follower. India Unique Unit - Varu: Classical era mounted unit. Replaces Horseman, has 2 movement and 40 melee attack. Inflicts -5 Combat Strength on all adjacent enemy units. IndiaUnique Infrastructure - Stepwell: Tile imrpvoement. Bestows +1 Food and +1 Housing. +1 Faith is adjacent to a Holy Site (another +1 with Feudalism). +1 additional Food if adjacent to a Farm, and another +1 with Professional Sports, +1 more Housing, too, with Sanitation. Cannot be built on Hills or adjacent to another Stepwell. Chandragupta Unique Ability - Arthashastra: When you unlock the Military Training Civic you can then declare a War of Territorial Expansion,
and after declaring a War of Terrirorial Expansion your units gain +2 Movement and +5 Combat Strength for the first 10 turns.
Chandragupta Tips:</p><p>When playing as Chandragupta: An agressive expansionist, Chandragupta is all about rushing Military Training and getting to war early. Stepwells are excellent in the early game, although aside from the bonus housing they fall off in the mid to late game after Feudalism is unlocked - use these to achieve rapid early to mid-game city growth. The Varu, meanwhile, is your route to early domination that you can carry on to a late-game victory. When playing against Chandragupta: Anti-cavalry units will be important, and while you&rsquo;ll be heading straight to war if you&rsquo;re nearby thanks to his agenda that favours war with neighbours, if you spawn further away from him you should still make preparations. The good news is that Chandragupta doesn&rsquo;t have any innate boosts to Production or Gold available, so it&rsquo;s possible to out sustain him in war or accelerate past him in other areas, too.</p><p>Civilization: Korea Leader: Seondeok
Korea Unique Ability - Three Kingdoms: Mines receive +1 Science if there is an adjacent Seowon district, and Farms receive bonus Food if there&rsquo;s an adjacent Seowon. Korea Unique Unit - Hwacha: Renaissance Era ranged unit with high Ranged strength, but cannot move and attack in the same turn. Korea Unique Infrastructure - Seowon: A Science-based district that replaces the Campus, with a faster time to build, and that must be built on hills. Grants +4 Science, but -1 Science for each adjacent District, including the City Centre. Specialists here add +2 Science each, and provides +1 Great Scientist point per turn. Seondeok Unique Ability - Hwarang: +10% Culture and +10% Science in all cities with an established Governor.
Seondeok Tips:</p><p>When playing as Seondeok: Your Seowons are of course the thing you should be prioritising with Korea, and should be rushed as soon as possible. Combining them with some surrounding flat land for farms and hills for mines will give your city a nice balance of sustained growth and Production, but they can also be more specialised if you have a particularly flat or hilly city in mind. With that, and the Governor Pingala&rsquo;s Researcher promotion that boosts the speed at which you can construct Campus-based buildings in the city, and the Hwarang bonus, you should be well on your way to a Science-rush victory. When playing against Seondeok: Warfare can be disruptive to Seondeok&rsquo;s early Science rush, as she&rsquo;ll be forced to prioritise military units and production over growth and Science. Beware of that mid-game powerhouse the Hwacha though - if it sets up before you can get to melee range it can pick off other mid-game units with ease.</p><p>Civilization: Mapuche Leader: Lautaro
Mapuche Unique Ability - Toqui: Units trained in cities with an established Governor gain 25% more experience in combat. All units receive +10 Combat Strength against civilizations that are in a Golden Age. Mapuche Unique Unit - Malón Raider: Renaissance Era light cavalry unit, that has +5 Combat Strength within 4 tiles of friendly territory and requires less Movement to pillage. Mapuche Unique Infrastructure - Chemamull: Tile improvement that must be built on a tile with an Appeal of Breathtaking (4 or above). Grants Culture equal to 75% of that tile&rsquo;s Appeal Lautaro Unique Ability - Swift Hawk: If one of your units defeats an enemy unit within the borders of that enemy&rsquo;s city, that city loses 20 Loyalty.
Lautaro Tips:</p><p>When playing as Lautaro: Lautaro is combat-focused, although his unique structure the Chemamull is an excellent source of Culture and late-game Tourism after researching Flight, so his combat bonuses are best spent sculpting, and then defending, his own borders - especially in the mid-game where his Malón Raiders are at their most effective. Identify the cities you want to capture or the land you want to claim, and once you&rsquo;re happy with your land (which should be high in appeal), dig in. Aiming for the Eiffel Tower wonder, which boosts the Tourism output of your Chemamulls via boosting their tiles&rsquo; appeal, is a great bet. When playing against Lautaro: For one, beware conflict with Lautaro when you&rsquo;re in a Golden Age, as the +10 Combat Strength bonus his units get will seriously affect the conflict. Otherwise, pipping him to the Eiffel Tower will make a dent in his Tourism - or at least prevent it getting out of hand in the late game - and combining the Governors Victor and Amani if your borders are close to Lautaro will help fend off the threat of conquest and revolt.</p><p>Civilization: Mongolia Leader: Genghis Khan
Mongolia Unique Ability - Örtöö: Starting a Trade Route creates a Trading Post in the destination city instantly, rather than on completion. You receive an extra level of Diplomatic Visibility for possessing a TRading Post in any city of a civilization, and Mongolian units gain +3 Combat Strength for each level of Diplomatic Visibility on their opponent. Mongolia Unique Unit - Keshig: A Medieval Era mounted ranged unit, with a ranged unit promotion table, but 4 Movement range. Shares its movement range with all units in a formation if it forms one. Mongolia Unique Infrastructure - Ordu: Ancient Era Encampment building, replcaing the Stable. Provides +1 Production, +1 Housing, +1 Citizen slot, +1 Great General point per turn, +25% combat experience for all light and heavy cavalry units trained there, and +1 Movement for all cavalry units trained in that city. Genghis Khan Unique Ability - Mongol Horde: All cavalry class units gain +3 Combat strength, and defeating enemy cavalry class units gives you a chance to capture that unit instead of destroying it.
Genghis Khan Tips:</p><p>When playing as Genghis Khan: Predictably, Genghis Khan is all about massing your cavalry and securing a sweeping Domination Victory.
His bonuses line up perfectly and simply: trade with other civs to set up Trading Posts and gain Diplomatic Visibility, then build Ordu structures, train cavalry of all kinds, and lob them at whoever you want, because you&rsquo;ll probably win. In the early to mid game he&rsquo;s an absolute machine, particularly when you start capturing units for free too - and in the late game you&rsquo;ll probably have captured enough cities to be well ahead of the pack anyway. When playing against Genghis Khan: Anti-cavalry units are essential, but the issue will be with his Keshig archers, which require anti-ranged units like cavalry themselves - but your cavalry are succeptible to conversion if they get defeated, which can quickly add up against you. It can be beneficial to go to war with him early, before he gains Diplomatic Visibility of you through Trade Routes. Otherwise, if you can gain a Scientific advantage, progressing past the Medieval era will alow you to more safely utilise anti-cavalry units without his Keshigs being such a threat.</p><p>Civilization: Scotland Leader: Robert the Bruce
Scotland Unique Ability - Scottish Enlightenment: Happy cities receive +5% Science and +5% Production, along with generating +1 Great Scientist point per Campush and +1 Great Engineer point per Industrial Zone. Ecstatic cities double all of the above, to 10% bonuses and +2 points each. Scotland Unique Unit - Highlander: Industrial Era recon unit with additional Combat and Ranged Strength, and another +5 Combat Strength in Hills and Woods. Scotland Unique Infrastructure - Golf Course: Tile improvement that cannot be placed on Desert or Desert Hill tiles, and limited at one per city. Provides +1 Amenity, +2 Gold, +1 Appeal, +1 Culture if adjacent to a City Center, +1 Culture if adjacent to an Entertainment Complex, and +1 Housing with Globalization. Robert the Bruce Unique Ability - Bannockburn: After researching the Defensive Tactics Civic, instead of the Diplomatic Service Civic, you can declare a War of Liberation. +100% Production and +2 Movement for the first 10 turns after declaring one.
Robert the Bruce Tips:</p><p>When playing as Robert the Bruce: Robert is highly flexible, with his various Science, Production and Great Person bonuses making him great at rushing Wonders and achieving a progress advantage over other civs, whilst he can leap to war to defend his allies early on with War of Liberation. The best way to play then is as a peaceful, productive civ that&rsquo;s able to defend itself if there&rsquo;s any impending threat. When playing against Robert the Bruce: For starters, don&rsquo;t go to war with any of his friends or allies unless you want to fight him too.
Otherwise, be wary of his rapid acquisition of Great People - if they&rsquo;re ones you&rsquo;re after and you can&rsquo;t match him head-on, consider patronage, as Robert receives no major bonuses to Gold or, in particular, Faith. The longer he goes on unchallenged in military terms, the stronger he&rsquo;ll get and more he&rsquo;ll be able to snowball his Science and Production yields.</p><p>Civilization: Zulu Leader: Shaka
Zulu Unique Ability - Isibongo: Cities that have a garrisoned unit get +3 Loyalty per turn or +5 if it&rsquo;s a Corps or Army there. Units that conquer a city are automatically upgraded into a Corps or Army if you have the Civic unlocked for them. Zulu Unique Unit - Impi: Medieval anti cavalry unit replacing the Pikeman. Faster to produce, and lower maintenance cost, with increased bonus for Flanking and faster XP gains. Zulu Unique Infrastructure - Ikanda: District replacing the Encampment. GRants +1 Great General point per turn, +1 Housing, +1 Production and Cultre from specialists, all the other usual aspects of an Encampment as well as the ability to train Corps and Armies without building the Military Academy, and grants +25% faster training of Corps and Armies. Shaka Unique Ability - Amabutho: You can form Corps from the Mercenaries Civic and Armies from the Nationalism Civic, rather than them unlocking later on. Extra +5 Combat Strength to both Corps and Armies.
Shaka Tips:</p><p>When playing as Shaka: The obviosu focus of Shaka is military Domination Victories, via the use of massed units in Corps and Armies. Rushing Encampments, as well as Mercenaries and Nationalism Civics down the line, will let you rapidly sweep through enemy cities and build up some huge numbers of adjacent, stacked units. Try to time capturing cities for after you get one of those Civics if you&rsquo;re close to unlocking them, as the free Corps or Armies makes a major difference. When playing against Shaka: If you&rsquo;re nearby, expect to be attacked fairly soon. Ranged units will work best, as your cavalry will struggle against his amassed Impi. If you&rsquo;re further away, progressing past the Medieval era will lower the impact of those Impi, but by then he may have more Corps and Armies amassing, too.</p><p>If your lust for Civilization 6 knowledge is still going strong, expansion owners should take a look at our Civ 6 Rise and Fall guide hub which takes you through the basics of everything new, whilst we have dedicated pages on Governors and Loyalty, along with how to earn Golden Ages, Era Points and Era Score through Historic Moments, and a full list of new Civs in Civ 6 Rise and Fall and other DLC.

We also have tips on the new Districts feature, a Leaders list with their Traits and Agendas, plus the best ways to get Gold, Science, and Faith, how to win by Religious Victory, and how to earn the elusive Science Victory and Military domination victory. Finally, here&rsquo;s the Culture Victory, Foreign Tourism, and Domestic Tourism explained in depth.
DLC Pack: Pre-order bonus or Aztec Civilization Pack Civilization: Aztec Leader: Montezuma
Aztec Unique Ability- Legend of the Five Suns: Spend Builder charges to complete 20% of the original district charge. Aztec Unique Unit - Eagle Warrior: Ancient era melee unit. Has a chance to capture other civilization&rsquo;s military units by turning them into builders. Replaces the Warrior. Aztec Unique Infrastructure - Tlachtli: +2 Faith, +1 Amenity from entertainment, +1 Great General point per turn. Replaces Arena. Montezuma Unique Ability - Gifts for the Tlatoani: Luxury resources in his territory provide an Amenity to 2 extra cities. Military units receive +1 Combat Strength for each different Luxury resource improved in Aztec lands.
Montezuma Tips: </p><p>When playing as Montezuma: Bigger is better when playing as Montezuma. Expand territory in order to claim as many luxury resources as possible for the boost they provide to both Amenities and unit Combat Strength. Use Eagle Warrirors as much as possible in the early game to capture enemy units and turn them into Builders to harvest those luxury resources and also speed the production of districts. If such expansion requires war, so be it. Montezuma is well equipped for war in the early game and the additional Amenities provided by luxury resources will not only boost Combat Strength but also offset any population unrest of the war waging around their ears. When playing against Montezuma, be aware of his agenda: Tlatoani. Montezuma likes civilizations that have the same luxury resources as he does, so that he doesn&rsquo;t feel like he&rsquo;s missing out. He dislikes civilizations that have luxury resources that he doesn&rsquo;t have.</p><p>DLC Pack: Poland Civilization and Scenario Pack Civilization: Poland Leader: Jadwiga
Pland Unique Ability - Golden Liberty: When Poland completes an Encampment or Fort inside friendly territory, it gains adjacent tiles, even if they belong to another Civ. Also, one of Poland&rsquo;s Military Policy slots is converted to a Wildcard Policy slot. Poland Unique Unit - Winged Hussar: Medieval era cavalry unit. When attacking, if it does more damage than the defending enemy, it pushes them back one tile. If they can&rsquo;t move back, it does additional damage. Poland Unique Infrastructure - Sukiennice: Replaces the Market. +3 Gold, +1 Citizen, +1 Great Merchant Point-per-turn, +4 Gold from domestic Trade Routes, +2 Production from international Trade Routes. Jadwiga Unique Ability - Lithuanian Union: When using the Golden Liberty &lsquo;culture bomb&rsquo; to gain territory from another Civ&rsquo;s city, it will convert that city to her Religion. Relics also produce +4 Gold, +2 Culture, +2 Faith, and Holy Site districts gain additional adjacency bonuses.
Jadwiga Tips:</p><p>When playing as Jadwiga: Although there&rsquo;s seemingly an emphasis on Faith generation with Poland and Jadwiga, they&rsquo;re actually surprisingly flexible. Additional Gold and Production from various sources means that playing a &lsquo;wide&rsquo; game - with lots of cities spread out early on - is made far more easy, whilst the conversion of a Military Policy to a Wildcard Policy can be very helpful for adapting to the game at hand. Couple that with the displacement abilities of both the Winged Hussar and the return of the &lsquo;culture bomb&rsquo;, and Jadwiga&rsquo;s Poland is all about expansion. When playing against Jadwiga: Generate lots of Faith to avoid getting into a conflict with her - or at least delay the inevitable. Her agenda, Saint, sees her try to build up lots of Faith herself, and look favourably on others who do the same. Regardless, against an AI Jadwiga you&rsquo;ll likely soon find available land disappearing, and a rival Civ with a huge population at their disposal thanks to her ability to expand. Make sure you have enough resources and diversified cities as soon as possible to counter her, and keep a strong military to hand to deal with those mid-game Winged Hussars.</p><p>DLC Pack: Australia Civilization and Scenario Pack Civilization: Australia Leader: John Curtin
Australia Unique Ability - Land Down Under: +3 Housing in coastal cities. Building a Pasture triggers a Cultre Bomb, claiming surrounding tiles. Campuses, Commercial Hubs, Holy Sites and Theatre Squares gain +1 to yields in tiles with Charming Appeal and +3 to those with Breathtaking Appeal.
Australia Unique Unit - Digger: Modern Era Melee Unit that replaces the Infantry. 72 Combat Strength, +10 Combat Strength on Coastal Tiles,
+5 outside Australian territory, and requires no resources to build. CIV Unique Infrastructure - Outback Station: Tile improvement that can&rsquo;t be built on Snow or Tundra. Grants that tile +1 Food and Production;
+0.5 Housing; +1 Food from every adjacent Pasture, +1 Production from every 2 adjacent Outback Stations when you research Steam Power and +1 Food from every 2 adjacent Outback Stations when you research Rapid Deployment. John Curtin Unique Ability - Citadel of Civilization: Gain +100% Production if you have received a declaration of war in the past 10 turns,
or if you&rsquo;ve liberated a city in the past 20 turns.
John Curtin Tips:</p><p>When playing as John Curtin: Your combat is going to be greatly boosted around coastal cities thanks to Diggers. Raiding others is particularly strong thanks to the additional +5 bonus for non-Australian territory combat, and then taking those cities will grant you the +3 housing bonus from Land Down Under. That&rsquo;ll probably stack with the additional Appeal normally found in coastal areas, meaning coastal cities is the way forward, and making Australia one of the strongest options for more ocean-heavy map types, too. When playing against John Curtin: Avoiding coastal combat is the obvious one, and you should note that they don&rsquo;t get any specific boosts to naval warfare. If you can protect your cities from the sea, then ranged units will do well to protect them from the melee-class Diggers on the land,
whether you&rsquo;re attacking or defending. Otherwise if you know you&rsquo;re near to them, making a land-grab for the decent coastal tiles nearby will help minimise their stacking bonuses, too.</p><p>DLC Pack: Persia and Macedon Civilization and Scenario Pack Civilization: Persia Leader: Cyrus
Persia Unique Ability - Satrapies: +1 Trade Route capacity when you unlock the Political Philosophy civic. +2 Gold and +1 Culture from routes between your own cities. Roads built in your territory are one level more advanced than usual. Persia Unique Unit - Immortal: A strange unit that is both melee class, with strong melee defence, but with a ranged attack that&rsquo;s stronger than the Archer&rsquo;s but has the same attack range. Replaces the Swordsman (has slightly lower Melee strength) and upgrades directly to the Musketman. Persia Unique Infrastructure - Pairidaeza: Tile improvement that can&rsquo;t be built on Tundra or Snow. Grants +1 Culture, +2 Gold, +2 Appeal on a tile plus +1 Culture for every adjacent Holy Site and Theatre Square, +1 Culture after unlocking Diplomatic Service and +1 Gold for every adjacent Commercial Hub and City Centre. Cyrus Unique Ability - Fall of Babylon: +2 Movement for the first 10 turns after you declare a Surprise War. No penalties to yields in occupied cities, and Surprise Wars only count as Formal Wars in terms of warmongering and war weariness penalties.
Cyrus Tips:</p><p>When playing as Cyrus: Cyrus is geared towards fast, early-game conquest. The fact that occupied cities will act as normal, coupled with the added trade routes you&rsquo;ll likely unlock as you go and the Satrapies bonus will likely stack nicely. In short: rush Immortals, stack them up and declare a Surprise War, then get rolling. When playing against Cyrus: For one, never trust him, whether it&rsquo;s AI or a real player, as his entire setup is geared not only towards warfare but surprise warfare. Immortals have better melee strength than normal Archers but are still weaker than regular melee units, so cavalry is a good bet for steamrolling them. He&rsquo;ll also have naturally high Culture thanks to Satrapies and Pairidaeza, making Tourism-based victories difficult against him.</p><p>DLC Pack: Persia and Macedon Civilization and Scenario Pack Civilization: Macedonia Leader: Alexander the Great
Macedonia Unique Ability - Hellenistic Fusion: receive a Eureka boost for each Encampment or Campus in a city when you conquer it, and an Inspiration for each Holy Site or Theatre Square. Macedonia Unique Unit - Hypaspist: Melee unit that replaces the Swordsman, but doesn&rsquo;t require Iron. +5 Combat Strength then beseiging a district and +50% support bonuses. Macedonia Unique Infrastructure - Basilikoi Paides: Encampment building replacing the Barracks. Grants +1 Production, Housing, Great General point per turn and and Citizen slot. +25% combat experience for all melee and ranged land units and Hetairoi trained in this city. Gain Science equal to 25%
of the unit&rsquo;s cost when a non-civilian unit is created in this city. Alexander Unique Ability - To the World&rsquo;s End: Cities don&rsquo;t acquire war weariness. All military units heal completely when this player captures a city with a world wonder. Alexander Unique Unit - Hetairoi: Heavy cavalry unit that replaces the Horseman. +5 Combat Strength when adjacent to a Great General (on top of the usual bonus); +5 Great General points from kills. Starts with a free promotion and does not require Horses to build.
Alexander the Great Tips:</p><p>When playing as Alexander: Alexander is, predictably, compeltely focused on securing a Domination victory. You need to be thinking about this from the outset, as his power spike is in the classical era where he can have two unique, and powerful, units together at one time, whilst still receiving Science for building them in Basilikoi and more Science and Culture progress from conquering cities. Basically, start a war early and don&rsquo;t stop. When playing against Alexander: Good luck! Early game you&rsquo;ll need some Archers and some anti-cavalry like Spearmen as soon as possible if you start near Alexander. AI Alexanders will almost never surrender or make peace with you, and it&rsquo;s unlikely human opponents will either. If you&rsquo;re far away, it might be worth conquering some nearby cities too and making sure you have a number of Encampments dotted around to defend yourself. Gaining supremacy in terms of technology, and thus the air and sea, can also make a difference - both of his unique units are early-game and land-based.</p><p>DLC Pack: Nubia Civilization and Scenario Pack Civilization: Nubia Leader: Amanitore
Nubia Unique Ability - Ta-Seti: +50% Production towards Ranged units and all Ranged units gain +50% combat experience. Mines over strategic resoruces provide +1 Production, and Mines over bonus and luxury resources provide +2 Gold. Nubia Unique Unit - Pítati Archer: Ranged unit replacing the Archer. Slightly higher Production cost to build, but higher Combat Strength and Ranged Strength, and one extra movement speed. Nubia Unique Infrastructure - Nubian Pyramid: Tile improvement that must be built on Desert or Floodplain tiles. Grants +1 Faith, plus +1 Food if adjacent to a City Centre, +1 Science if adjacent to a Campus, +1 Gold if adjacent to a Commercial Hub or Hardor, +1 Faith if adjacent to a Holy Site, +1 Production if adjacent to an Industrial Zone and +1 Culture if adjacent to a Theatre Square. Amanitore Unique Ability - Kandake of Meroë: +20% Production in all districts, or +40% if the city contains a Nubian Pyramid adjacent to the City Centre.
Amanitore Tips:</p><p>When playing as Amanitore: The boosts to Production and Gold from various sources make Amanitore and Nubia a strong military-focuses Civ,
but likewise the Nubian Pyramid&rsquo;s diverse bonuses, and various applications of high Production in your cities - like building Wonders or Space Race Projects - means that Nubia is a very flexible Civ too, with the boosted ranged units and Archers available as a nice defensive buffer against more expansionist leaders. When playing against Amanitore: The good news is that a lot of Amanitore&rsquo;s benefits come from being near desert tiles for her Nubian Pyramids, which restricts her significantly. If you&rsquo;re nearby, making a land grab for a good desert spot can help, as can beating her to desert and Production-focused Wonders like the Pyramids or Ruhr Valley. Cavalry is the way to beat her Archers, although be wary of their extra movement!</p><p>DLC Pack: Khmer and Indonesia Civilization and Scenario Pack Civilization: Khmer Leader: Jayavarman VII
Khmer Unique Ability - Grand Barays: +3 Faith and +1 Amenity from entertainment to each city with an Aquaduct, plus Farms provide +2 Food if adjacent to an Aqueduct. Khmer Unique Unit - Domrey: Siege unit, stronger than a catapult and deals Bombard Damage, and can move as well as attack in one turn and exerts zone of crontrol. Khmer Unique Infrastructure - Prasat: Holy Site building that replaces the Temple. Grants +4 Faith, doubled with the Simultaneum Policy, plus +1 Citizen slot, +1 Great Prophet point per turn, and +2 Relic slots. Allowes purchasing of Apostles and Inquisitors and also Missionaries purchased in a city with a Prasat gain the Martyr promotion. Jayavarman VII Unique Ability - Monasteries of the King: Holy Sites provide +2 Food and +1 Housing if placed on a river, and Holy Sites trigger a culture bomb, letting you grab land tiles around it.
Jayavarman VII Tips:</p><p>When playing as Jayavarman VII: Jayavarman VII is a weird one, focusing on a combination of high citizen growth and religious bonuses -particularly in terms of Relic-based Tourism - as well has having a handy mid-game siege unit available. Focus on citizen growth and religion in the early game, rushing Aquaducts when you can and placing Farms nearby - this works especially well if you can settle near a river and mountain, where the bonuses will stack up. Then, holy wars will grant you a flow of Relics if you lose Missionaries, and your large base of citizens will benefit from per-citizen religious bonuses, too. You&rsquo;re flexible in terms of victory type from this point, as the sustainable, high population can be put to various uses. When playing against Jayavarman VII: Although the Domrey is a useful siege unit, Jayavarman VII doesn&rsquo;t really get any other defensive benefits from his bonuses, so an early rush to conquer his cities will certainly help. Letting him quickly spread to claim river-based cities and convert your own cities unapposed will be an issue - so you may want to think about having a strong, offensive Religion of your own.</p><p>DLC Pack: Khmer and Indonesia Civilization and Scenario Pack Civilization: Indonesia Leader: Gitarja
Indonesia Unique Ability - Great Nusantara: Coast and Lake tiles grant minor adjacency bonuses for Holy Site, Campus, Industrial Zone and Theatre Square districts Indonesia Unique Unit - Jong: Ranged naval unit replacing the Frigate. Slightly higher production cost but an extra point of movement speed,
and +5 Combat strength when in formation, and shares its movement speed with all units in that formation. Indonesia Unique Infrastructure - Kampung: Tile improvement that must be built on Coast or Lake tiles adjacent to sea resources. Grants +1 Production and Housing, +1 Food from every adjacent Fishing Boat, and +1 Housing with Mass Production, +1 Production with Civil Engineering, and +1 Tourism from every bonus Food with Flight. Gitarja Unique Ability - Exalted Goddess of the Three Worlds: Naval units can be purchased with Faith, and Religious units don&rsquo;t lose movement for embarking or disembarking. +2 Faith to City Centres that are adjacent to Coast or Lake tiles.
Gitarja Tips:</p><p>When playing as Gitarja: Gitarja is a leader best suited to two things: a religious playstyle, and an island-based map. The Jong is perfectly suited to accompanying your Settlers, dragging them up to their 5 Movement Speed, so you can rapidly expand your aquatic empire. You&rsquo;ll also get a decent early Faith income just from founding those cities, and again your Faith units will be able to rapidly and safely move across bodies of water to spread your religion. Basically, expand fast and use that to your advantage as you progress! When playing against Gitarja: Gitarja is severely limited when playing on land-based maps, or if you can beat her to settling on the resource-rich coastal spots early on. The Jong, meanwhile, is a good unit for convoying settlers but hardly an intimidating one, with it being more about using its mobility against you than its brute strength. Likewise she gains a decent Faith income from her bonuses but her religious units&rsquo; bonuses are all built around naval mobility, rather than religious combat. Gitarja is also fairly weak to land-based domination if any of her cities are founded on larger chunks of land that you can reach on foot.
