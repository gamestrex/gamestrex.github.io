To increase his effectiveness, you should actually aim to increase Itto’s defence, as his skills convert this into increased damage. Here’s a summary of Arataki Itto’s abilities and stats in Genshin Impact:\nElement: Geo. Rarity: 5-Star. Weapon: Claymore. Banner: Oni’s Royale. Best build: DPS. Normal Attack: Fight Club Legend. Elemental Skill: Masatsu Zetsugi, Akaushi Burst! Elemental Burst: Royal Descent, Behold Itto the Evil! Passive one: Arataki Ichiban (when Itto uses consecutive Arataki Kesagiri charged attacks, each of his slashes increase the attack speed of his next slash by 10%, and he is also less likely to get interrupted by enemies - these effects only activate when Itto performs consecutive slashes). Passive two: Bloodline of the Crimson Oni (Arataki Kesagiri charged attack damage is increased by 35% of Itto’s defence). Exploration bonus: Woodchuck Chucked (when a party member gathers wood from a tree, they have a 25% chance to get an additional log of wood).\nArataki Itto Normal Attack: Fight Club Legend Arataki Itto can perform up to four consecutive strikes, gaining one stack of Superlative Strength on the second strike, and two stacks of Superlative Strength on the fourth strike, with a maximum of five stacks allowed. This attack combo does not reset after dashing or using his Elemental Skill, allowing you to chain moves for increased attack damage. When a charged normal attack is used, Itto performs Arataki Kesagiri slashes without consuming stamina. Instead, each of these charged slashes consumes one stack of Superlative Superstrength. When the last stack is consumed, Itto will perform a final slash with increased damage. If you don’t have any stacks of Superlative Superstrength when using a charged attack, Itto will perform a Saichimonji Slash instead.\nArataki Itto Elemental Skill: Masatsu Zetsugi, Akaushi Burst! When activated, Arataki Itto hurls Ushi, dealing Geo damage to any opponents it hits. With every opponent Ushi hits, Itto will also gain a stack of Superlative Superstrength. Ushi will continue to provide support to Itto after being thrown by taunting enemies, and providing one stack of Superlative Superstrength each time it is hit by an opponent. This can only build one stack every two seconds. When Ushi’s health reaches zero or its duration ends, Itto will gain one more stack of Superlative Superstrength.\nArataki Itto Elemental Burst: Royal Descent, Behold Itto the Evil! When activated, Arataki Itto’s Elemental Burst converts his normal, charged, and plunge attacks into Geo damage, which can’t be overridden. Itto’s normal attack speed is also increased, as is his attack. When he hits with his Elemental Burst active, the first and third strikes of Itto’s combo give him one stack of Superlative Superstrength each on top of the stacks he already gets from his regular attack on the second and fourth strikes. Itto’s elemental and physical resistance is also increased by 20% while his Burst is active.\nGenshin Impact Arataki Itto Talent materials To get the most out of using Arataki Itto, you will have to level his skills up by using Talent materials, which vary from character-to-character.\rFor Arataki Itto, you’re going to need to farm a lot of Slime and Elegance items (if you don’t already have them) to fully upgrade his DPS capabilities. As Arataki Itto has three Talents, you will have to spend three times the Talent materials listed below to fully upgrade all of his abilities.\rHere’s all the Arataki Itto Talent materials you need to improve one of his abilities:\nGenshin Impact Arataki Itto Ascension materials Just like Talents, you need to use Arataki Itto Ascension materials to upgrade his health, attack, defence, and critical hit effectiveness.\rFor Arataki Itto, you’re going to need to farm a lot of Onikabuto and Slime materials (if you don’t already have them) to fully upgrade his Elemental Skill and Burst capabilities. Unlike Talent materials, you only need to spend the below Ascension materials once to fully raise Arataki Itto to his highest character level. There is also Acquaint Fate rewarded for reaching certain Ascension levels. You can spend this Fate on standard and beginner Banners to Wish for characters and weapons.\rHere are all the Arataki Itto Ascension materials:.\nGenshin Impact Arataki Itto Constellation By getting duplicates of Arataki Itto from wishing on Banners, you will receive his Stella Fortuna. This material allows you to unlock Constellation levels, with each upgrade either improving an existing Talent or Passive ability.\rYou don’t actually need any of Itto’s Constellations for him to be an effective DPS carry, but getting him to C2 is recommended if you are using a Geo team but are still struggling for Energy Recharge on his Elemental Burst. Here are all of Arataki Itto’s Constellation level upgrades in Genshin Impact:\nStay a While and Listen Up (C1): After using his Elemental Burst Arataki Itto gains two stacks of Superlative Superstrength. After one second, Itto will gain one stack of Superlative Superstrength every half a second for one and a half seconds. Gather Round, It’s a Brawl! (C2): After using his Elemental Burst each Geo party member will decrease its cooldown by one and a half seconds and restore six energy to Arataki Itto. Horns Lowered, Coming Through (C3): Increases the level of Itto’s Elemental Skill by three, with the maximum upgrade level capping at 15. Jailhouse Bread and Butter (C4): When the Raging Oni King state caused by Itto’s Elemental Burst ends, all nearby party members gain 20% defence and attack for ten seconds. 10 Years of Hanamizaka Fame (C5): Increases the level of Itto’s Elemental Burst by three, with a maximum upgrade level of 15. Arataki Itto, Present! (C6): Arataki Itto’s charged attacks deal +70% critical damage, and when he uses Arataki Kesagiri charged attacks, Itto has a 50% chance to not consume stacks of Superlative Superstrength.\nHow to play Arataki Itto in Genshin Impact The best build for Arataki Itto is DPS, as he can pretty much carry a whole team as long as his defence stats are raised and Energy Recharge needs are met on his Elemental Burst by picking a a good team composition and Artifact and weapon buffs. When playing Itto in a DPS role, you should aim to build stacks of Superlative Strength and then unleash charged attacks to use these stacks up and cause large amounts of damage. It’s highly recommended to use your Superlative Strength stacks (and your Elemental Skill) after you have activated Itto’s Elemental Burst for a massive damage increase. That should be the general rotation throughout any battle with Itto as your DPS main: build Superlative Strength stacks, activate Elemental Burst, activate Elemental skill, then charge attack opponents.\nBest Arataki Itto team in Genshin Impact Team comps can be quite varied in Genshin Impact, but for Itto, there only really is one type of party member you should try to pair him with, and that’s Geo. The more Geo characters you have in a party, the more Energy you can get, which is very important for Itto’s Elemental Burst, his main damage source. Having a Geo character who provides a shield, like Zhongli, is also a great support for Itto. With Itto and Zhongli’s Geo Elemental Resonance, Zhongli’s shield strength will increase by 15%, and characters protected by the shield will deal 15% more damage. Other great Geo characters to support Itto with is Gorou, or even a Geo Traveler. You might also want to consider a good support character from another element like Fishcl or Bennett if you aren’t struggling with Energy needs.\nBest Arataki Itto Artifacts in Genshin Impact The best Arataki Itto Artifacts in Genshin Impact for a DPS build help raise his defence, Geo Damage, and critical hit chance. You should aim for a four set Husk of Opulent Dreams to increase Arataki Itto’s defence by at least 30%, and increase his Geo damage. You should at least try for a two piece Hust of Opulent Artifact set to benefit from the +30% defence.\rBuilding Itto’s defence stat should be your primary goal when equipping Artifacts, as his charged attack damage scales off his defence when he uses Superlative Strength stacks. Genshin Impact version 3.3 is here, with new codes, and new character Scaramouche (Wanderer), so find out where he’s placed on our tier list. You’ll need Primogems and luck of the Pity and 50/50 systems to Wish with Fate for him and other current and next banners. You’ll also need the right Adventure Rank for events. For more Sumeru help, we’ve got pages on Sumeru Reputation, Tree of Dreams, Dendroculus locations, the Aeonblight Drake boss, the Garden of Endless Pillars Domain, and locations for Nilotpala Lotus, Padisarah, Scarabs, and Redcrest.\rYou can also now unlock the Genius Invokation TCG and, if you want help building your deck, check out our Genius Invokation TCG Card List.\rIf you want to relax, however, why not try fishing at one of the many fishing spot locations?\nBest Arataki Itto build in Genshin Impact With all this in mind, if you want to take advantage of Itto’s incredible DPS capabilities, we have compiled what we think is currently the best Arataki Itto build in Genshin Impact below:\nItto Best Weapon: Redhorn Stonethresher (or Whiteblind as a free-to-play option). Itto Best Artifacts: 4-piece Husk of Opulent Dreams. Itto Best team: Gorou, Zhongli, and Fischl.\nIt can take a lot of time to find these Artifacts and materials to level-up Arataki Itto, but he’s worth the effort, as even without unlocking Itto’s Constellations, he is capable of massive amounts of Geo damage and can carry a team if used effectively.\rGood luck levelling up Arataki Itto in Genshin Impact!\n","wordCount":"1792","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-22T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"John Davies"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/genshin-impact-arataki-itto-talent-and-ascension-materials-constellation-team-weapon-and-best-build/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Genshin Impact Arataki Itto Talent And Ascension Materials Constellation Team Weapon And Best Build</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 22, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1792 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;John Davies</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#genshin-impact-arataki-itto-talents-skills-star-element-and-weapon>Genshin Impact Arataki Itto Talents, skills, star, element, and weapon</a><ul><li><a href=#arataki-itto-normal-attack-fight-club-legend>Arataki Itto Normal Attack: Fight Club Legend</a></li><li><a href=#arataki-itto-elemental-skill-masatsu-zetsugi-akaushi-burst>Arataki Itto Elemental Skill: Masatsu Zetsugi, Akaushi Burst!</a></li><li><a href=#arataki-itto-elemental-burst-royal-descent-behold-itto-the-evil>Arataki Itto Elemental Burst: Royal Descent, Behold Itto the Evil!</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#genshin-impact-arataki-itto-talent-materials>Genshin Impact Arataki Itto Talent materials</a></li><li><a href=#genshin-impact-arataki-itto-ascension-materials>Genshin Impact Arataki Itto Ascension materials</a></li><li><a href=#genshin-impact-arataki-itto-constellation>Genshin Impact Arataki Itto Constellation</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-play-arataki-itto-in-genshin-impact>How to play Arataki Itto in Genshin Impact</a></li><li><a href=#best-arataki-itto-team-in-genshin-impact>Best Arataki Itto team in Genshin Impact</a></li><li><a href=#best-arataki-itto-artifacts-in-genshin-impact>Best Arataki Itto Artifacts in Genshin Impact</a></li><li><a href=#best-arataki-itto-build-in-genshin-impact>Best Arataki Itto build in Genshin Impact</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Itto is featured as the boosted 5-Star character in his Oni&rsquo;s Royale Banner in version 3.3, but he will eventually return at some point in the future when the Banner schedule cycles back to him.

Jailhouse Bread and Butter (C4): When the Raging Oni King state caused by Itto&rsquo;s Elemental Burst ends, all nearby party members gain 20% defence and attack for ten seconds. 10 Years of Hanamizaka Fame (C5): Increases the level of Itto&rsquo;s Elemental Burst by three, with a maximum upgrade level of 15. Arataki Itto, Present! (C6): Arataki Itto&rsquo;s charged attacks deal +70% critical damage, and when he uses Arataki Kesagiri charged attacks, Itto has a 50% chance to not consume stacks of Superlative Superstrength.</p><h2 id=how-to-play-arataki-itto-in-genshin-impact>How to play Arataki Itto in Genshin Impact<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-play-arataki-itto-in-genshin-impact>#</a></h2><p>The best build for Arataki Itto is DPS, as he can pretty much carry a whole team as long as his defence stats are raised and Energy Recharge needs are met on his Elemental Burst by picking a a good team composition and Artifact and weapon buffs.
When playing Itto in a DPS role, you should aim to build stacks of Superlative Strength and then unleash charged attacks to use these stacks up and cause large amounts of damage. It&rsquo;s highly recommended to use your Superlative Strength stacks (and your Elemental Skill) after you have activated Itto&rsquo;s Elemental Burst for a massive damage increase. That should be the general rotation throughout any battle with Itto as your DPS main: build Superlative Strength stacks, activate Elemental Burst, activate Elemental skill, then charge attack opponents.</p><h2 id=best-arataki-itto-team-in-genshin-impact>Best Arataki Itto team in Genshin Impact<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-arataki-itto-team-in-genshin-impact>#</a></h2><p>Team comps can be quite varied in Genshin Impact, but for Itto, there only really is one type of party member you should try to pair him with, and that&rsquo;s Geo. The more Geo characters you have in a party, the more Energy you can get, which is very important for Itto&rsquo;s Elemental Burst, his main damage source.
Having a Geo character who provides a shield, like Zhongli, is also a great support for Itto. With Itto and Zhongli&rsquo;s Geo Elemental Resonance, Zhongli&rsquo;s shield strength will increase by 15%, and characters protected by the shield will deal 15% more damage.
Other great Geo characters to support Itto with is Gorou, or even a Geo Traveler. You might also want to consider a good support character from another element like Fishcl or Bennett if you aren&rsquo;t struggling with Energy needs.</p><h2 id=best-arataki-itto-artifacts-in-genshin-impact>Best Arataki Itto Artifacts in Genshin Impact<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-arataki-itto-artifacts-in-genshin-impact>#</a></h2><p>The best Arataki Itto Artifacts in Genshin Impact for a DPS build help raise his defence, Geo Damage, and critical hit chance. You should aim for a four set Husk of Opulent Dreams to increase Arataki Itto&rsquo;s defence by at least 30%, and increase his Geo damage. You should at least try for a two piece Hust of Opulent Artifact set to benefit from the +30% defence.
Building Itto&rsquo;s defence stat should be your primary goal when equipping Artifacts, as his charged attack damage scales off his defence when he uses Superlative Strength stacks.
Genshin Impact version 3.3 is here, with new codes, and new character Scaramouche (Wanderer), so find out where he&rsquo;s placed on our tier list.
You&rsquo;ll need Primogems and luck of the Pity and 50/50 systems to Wish with Fate for him and other current and next banners. You&rsquo;ll also need the right Adventure Rank for events. For more Sumeru help, we&rsquo;ve got pages on Sumeru Reputation, Tree of Dreams, Dendroculus locations, the Aeonblight Drake boss, the Garden of Endless Pillars Domain, and locations for Nilotpala Lotus, Padisarah, Scarabs, and Redcrest.
You can also now unlock the Genius Invokation TCG and, if you want help building your deck, check out our Genius Invokation TCG Card List.
If you want to relax, however, why not try fishing at one of the many fishing spot locations?</p><h2 id=best-arataki-itto-build-in-genshin-impact>Best Arataki Itto build in Genshin Impact<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-arataki-itto-build-in-genshin-impact>#</a></h2><p>With all this in mind, if you want to take advantage of Itto&rsquo;s incredible DPS capabilities, we have compiled what we think is currently the best Arataki Itto build in Genshin Impact below:</p><p>Itto Best Weapon: Redhorn Stonethresher (or Whiteblind as a free-to-play option). Itto Best Artifacts: 4-piece Husk of Opulent Dreams. Itto Best team: Gorou, Zhongli, and Fischl.</p><p>It can take a lot of time to find these Artifacts and materials to level-up Arataki Itto, but he&rsquo;s worth the effort, as even without unlocking Itto&rsquo;s Constellations, he is capable of massive amounts of Geo damage and can carry a team if used effectively.
Good luck levelling up Arataki Itto in Genshin Impact!</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Genshin-Impact-Arataki-Itto.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Genshin-Impact-Arataki-Itto.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact Arataki Itto Talent and Ascension materials  Constellation  team  weapon and best build - 21"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Genshin-Impact-Slime-Concentrate.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Genshin-Impact-Slime-Concentrate.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact Arataki Itto Talent and Ascension materials  Constellation  team  weapon and best build - 78"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Genshin-Impact-Onikabuto.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Genshin-Impact-Onikabuto.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact Arataki Itto Talent and Ascension materials  Constellation  team  weapon and best build - 50"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Genshin-Impact-Itto-Constellation.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Genshin-Impact-Itto-Constellation.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact Arataki Itto Talent and Ascension materials  Constellation  team  weapon and best build - 76"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Genshin-Impact-Arataki-Itto-how-to-play.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Genshin-Impact-Arataki-Itto-how-to-play.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact Arataki Itto Talent and Ascension materials  Constellation  team  weapon and best build - 75"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Genshin-Impact-Arataki-Itto-best-team.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Genshin-Impact-Arataki-Itto-best-team.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact Arataki Itto Talent and Ascension materials  Constellation  team  weapon and best build - 58"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Genshin-Impact-Arattaki-Itto.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Genshin-Impact-Arattaki-Itto.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact Arataki Itto Talent and Ascension materials  Constellation  team  weapon and best build - 59"></p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/genshin-impact-3-3-livestream-date-time-and-what-to-expect-from-3-3-banners/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Genshin Impact 3 3 Livestream Date Time And What To Expect From 3 3 Banners</span></a>
