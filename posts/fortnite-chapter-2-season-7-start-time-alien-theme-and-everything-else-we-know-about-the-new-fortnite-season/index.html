On this page:\nFortnite Season 7 Battle Pass skins Fortnite Superman skin release date Fortnite map changes in Season 7 Fortnite’s new Victory Umbrella Where to find UFOs in Fortnite How to get a ray gun in Fortnite Fortnite Payphone locations Fortnite Alien Artefact locations\nOriginal guide: Epic Games have confirmed that the release date for Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 7 will be Tuesday, 8th June. Going by for previous seasons, we can assume that the start times for Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 7 are the following:\nUK - 9am (BST) Europe - 10am (CEST) East Coast US - 4am (PDT) West Coast US - 1am (EDT)\nKeep in mind these are only estimates and, no matter what happens, there will be a period of downtime, along with a new patch for you to download. As well as the above, as with last season, a Fortnite Season 7 story trailer will debut online before the new season launches. You can start watching at the below times, and with the following YouTube embed:\nUK - 7am (BST) Europe - 8am (CEST) East Coast US - 2am (PDT) West Coast US - 11pm, Monday, 7th June (EDT)\nIn keeping with this theme, Season 7 has been entitled ‘They’re Coming,’ which has been confirmed both on the official Fortnite website and by a short promotional video. The build-up for Season 7 began with an ARG, which stands for alternative reality games. These are games which people play by completing activities in real life by either investigating clues online or, in some cases, visiting specific locations to either complete a task or find an object. If you’d like to investigate a currently running ARG, then I highly recommend Catastrophe Crow - also known as Crow 64. The ARG for Season 7 began on May 22nd people started receiving strange postcards containing the phrase ‘They’re coming’ and a mysterious glyph. These postcards were, at first, a mystery to everyone who received them, but it soon became clear it was part of the Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 7 promotion campaign. At the same time, posters resembling the postcards began to appear across the world in locations like London. Each poster displayed a phone number for that region, but we’ll return to those phone numbers in a moment.\nAs these posters and postcards were appearing, a number of Fortnite content creators in the UK, US and Australia received DVDs and DVD players, with ‘They’re coming’ handwritten on the disc. Each DVD played a short video of a real world location in their region and showed either a glyph or a crop circle. InTheLittleWood was one of the UK content creators who received such a package and you can watch the video in the tweet below. It’s important to note that there are no hidden messages within these video files as they’re simply promotional items for the upcoming Season 7. The audio files from the phone number, however, are a different story. There were four phone numbers in total - one for the UK, one for Australia, one for the US and one in Germany. After ringing one of these numbers, you’d find yourself listening to a pre-recorded message, roughly 30 seconds long, which contained a mixture of voice lines and strange sounds, because aliens. This pre-recorded message would change multiple times over the course of five days. There were four voice lines in total, with the first appearing on 24th May and being a man saying, ‘There’s something weird going on here.’ The second voice line was spoken by a woman who said, ‘Deciphering the signal is still ongoing.’ The third voice line to appear in the phone messages was also said by a woman. She asked, ‘If any of you are good with weird signals, pick up okay?’ This message was quickly replaced by ‘We’ve got movement on the signal. The thing is bigger and weirder than any of us thought.’ When the final voice line arrived, it simply said, ‘Watch the skies. They have found us.’ Now we need to talk about spectrograms. A spectrogram is a visual representation of the frequencies contained in a piece of audio and, by manipulating the pitch, people can hide a series of symbols within an audio track. As you noticed in the tweets above, it was revealed that, when placed in a spectrogram program, each of the pre-recorded messages contained a series of symbols. Some the symbols clearly hint at the oncoming alien invasion, while others focus on kangaroos, which could mean they’ll be the latest additions to the island’s wildlife. You can find all of the spectrograms for these phone calls in the tweet from iFireMonkey below: When tuning the radio for the downed black helicopter, you’ll discover a message from The Imagined Order, also known as IO, who are Agent Jones’ former employers. They appear to be planning some sort of operation and are moving a truck into place, which suggests they’ll play a part in upcoming events. The third foreshadowing challenge has you tracking down CB Radios, which, once interacted with, will let you hear a message from either Mari, Dennis or Turk. Mari has started a radio show investigating the alien sightings occurring across the island. She eventually catches the interest of IO and comes into contact with Doctor Slone who is Agent Jones’ former boss. Dennis is another alien enthusiast and Turk is trying to find Mari after her show vanishes off the air. Aside from the challenges, foreshadowing has also occurred in the form of map changes with a crop circle resembling the one in the video sent to InTheLittleWood appearing in Colossal Crops. Meanwhile, some players have been abducted by aliens at both The Spire and Risky Reels. Though the appearance of these alien ships is random, meaning there’s no guarantee you’ll encounter them. If you do then, sadly, you won’t get to see the aliens and will, instead, find yourself in a random place on the Fortnite map. An upcoming Loki skin has also been hinted at in the loading screen given out to Fortnite crew members in June. We don’t currently know whether this skin will be sold separately or will be a guest character earned in a similar manner to Season 6’s Neymar Jr skin. Finally, we have to hope that Season 7 will, in some way, continue the overarching storyline of the Zero Point. The last time Fortnite touched this storyline was with the Zero Crisis event, which bridged the gap between Season 5 and 6. During the Zero Crisis event, we assisted Agent Jones and The Foundation - a member of The Seven - in preventing the Zero Point from cracking. Despite our help, the only way to save the Zero Point was to seal The Foundation within the Zero Point itself and overload the device Agent Jones used for dimensional travel. This separated the new allies, trapping Agent Jones within The Loop, and, more importantly, robbed us of answers to some very interesting questions. Agent Jones is a former member of IO, and, considering The Foundation attacked him on sight, it’s clear IO and The Seven don’t get along. The Foundation only stopped when Jones promised to get him to Genō and the sisters. We, however, have no idea who the sisters are and whether Genō is a person or a place. Hopefully some of these questions will be answered in Fortnite Season 7 - possibly.\n","wordCount":"1313","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-22T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Shirley Cable"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/fortnite-chapter-2-season-7-start-time-alien-theme-and-everything-else-we-know-about-the-new-fortnite-season/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 7 Start Time Alien Theme And Everything Else We Know About The New Fortnite Season</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 22, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1313 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Shirley Cable</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>This new season will continue the story of Agent Jones and the Zero Point, after the The Foundation had to seal themselves inside it.
