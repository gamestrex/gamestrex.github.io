Scanning of flora, fauna and minerals no longer begins automatically, but begins when the player holds a button while looking at the relevant object. In VR, the Analysis Visor becomes Analysis Mode. Objects are scanned by aiming at them with the Multi-Tool. Custom Markers placed from the Analysis Visor now drop a physical object at the marker location. Significantly overhauled the Discovery Page to show a graphical representation of the system, as well as close up 3D representations of all discoveries and long text entries for fauna. Made butterflies and other flying creatures much easier to scan with the Analysis Visor. Added a new set of rare vibrant colour palettes for lush planets. Creature markers in the Analysis Visor now display how far away the creature is. Fixed an issue where creatures would never poop once they had been scared by a predator.

Added a base part that will automatically extract milk and other relevant resources from nearby creatures that are ready to be harvested. Throwing bait can attract a large number of creatures to one location. Throwing specialist carnivore bait can distract and placate angry or predatory creatures. Creatures that have been tamed by supplying their desired bait can be ridden. Creatures will still attempt to go about their own business, but their routines can be shaped by their rider.

The Nutrient Processor and the Portable Refiner now display a marker when they are not placed within a base.\nVisual Polish\nNada and Polo now use a larger range of animations.

Adjusted the timers of Sentinel patrols on lower security planets. In normal mode, allowed some planets to never spawn Sentinel drones. Added a chance to collect geodes when mining rocks or asteroids. Geodes can be analysed to extract large quantities of substances. Increased the base speed of all Refiner units. In normal mode, increased the slot storage limit for substances from 250 to 10,000. Increased the wealth levels at which higher tiers of pirates will attack. Increased the base energy levels of the Mining Beam and the Terrain Manipulator, allowing for less frequent recharging. Replaced the ‘Find specific building’ component of the Signal Booster with a system of planetary charts. Acquire planetary charts from Space Station Cartographers. Navigation Data can be traded for planetary charts. Collect Navigation Data when saving and charting at waypoints and save beacons. Using the Terrain Manipulator to mine basic ground will award silicate powder, which can be used to refine glass. Added a note on the interaction label of NPCs that have already been visited. When craftable products are the current mission objective, they are automatically pushed to the top of the product list. Adjusted the frequency of rare asteroids.

Objects are scanned by aiming at them with the Multi-Tool. Custom Markers placed from the Analysis Visor now drop a physical object at the marker location. Significantly overhauled the Discovery Page to show a graphical representation of the system, as well as close up 3D representations of all discoveries and long text entries for fauna. Made butterflies and other flying creatures much easier to scan with the Analysis Visor. Added a new set of rare vibrant colour palettes for lush planets. Creature markers in the Analysis Visor now display how far away the creature is. Fixed an issue where creatures would never poop once they had been scared by a predator.

Improved the visuals of Faceium deposits. Added a base part that will attract creatures to your base and automatically feed them. Added a base part that will automatically extract milk and other relevant resources from nearby creatures that are ready to be harvested. Throwing bait can attract a large number of creatures to one location. Throwing specialist carnivore bait can distract and placate angry or predatory creatures. Creatures that have been tamed by supplying their desired bait can be ridden. Creatures will still attempt to go about their own business, but their routines can be shaped by their rider. Upper body gestures may be used when seated or riding a creature. The Nutrient Processor and the Portable Refiner now display a marker when they are not placed within a base.</p><p>Visual Polish</p><p>Nada and Polo now use a larger range of animations. Improved the visuals for the Space Station entrance beam. Entirely reworked and expanded the cockpits of all ships. Increased the amount by which you can look around the starship cockpit. Added fully modelled cockpits / interiors for all the Exocraft and the Nautilon Submarine. Starship exteriors can now be seen while inside the starship. Improved the particle effects for the Scatter Blaster and the Blaze Javelin. Increased the scale of starships. Landing pads and docking areas across the galaxy have been expanded to cope with the new larger ships. As a result, landing pads in existing bases have been refunded.

Quality of Life</p><p>The Exosuit torch can now be turned on whatever the time of day. While the Pulse Engine is engaged, the central ship screen now displays a clearer message about fuel use. Technology can now be installed in stages, allowing incomplete tech to be placed in an inventory and its individual components added over time.

When installing an upgrade module, the correct inventory is automatically selected. Adjusted the probabilities of low, medium and high security planets in Normal Mode. Adjusted the timers of Sentinel patrols on lower security planets. In normal mode, allowed some planets to never spawn Sentinel drones. Added a chance to collect geodes when mining rocks or asteroids. Geodes can be analysed to extract large quantities of substances. Increased the base speed of all Refiner units. In normal mode, increased the slot storage limit for substances from 250 to 10,000. Increased the wealth levels at which higher tiers of pirates will attack. Increased the base energy levels of the Mining Beam and the Terrain Manipulator, allowing for less frequent recharging. Replaced the &lsquo;Find specific building&rsquo; component of the Signal Booster with a system of planetary charts. Acquire planetary charts from Space Station Cartographers. Navigation Data can be traded for planetary charts. Collect Navigation Data when saving and charting at waypoints and save beacons. Using the Terrain Manipulator to mine basic ground will award silicate powder, which can be used to refine glass. Added a note on the interaction label of NPCs that have already been visited. When craftable products are the current mission objective, they are automatically pushed to the top of the product list. Adjusted the frequency of rare asteroids. When buying a freighter, it now comes with some basic cargo already in the inventory. Increased the minimum speed while in space combat, creating better combat handling in most conditions. Increased the maximum speed while flying in space. Added a degree of roll when banking in planetary flight.

Ammunition is automatically promoted to the top of the crafting list if players try to reload but have no available ammo. Increased the default stack size for Ammunition. The Mining Beam now has a much higher base heat capacity. Reworked the Mining Beam overheat mechanic: the beam now cools down correctly rather than instantly resetting; the Mining Beam does more damage as it approaches max heat; the Mining Beam changes colour as it approaches max heat.
