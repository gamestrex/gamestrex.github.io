Within each week’s Wayfinder’s Voyage is broadly the same structure - visiting the H.E.L.M., completing an Astral Alignment, collecting Parallax Trajectory then entering the Shattered Realm, then returning to the H.E.L.M. for some character interactions to progress the story. Note that the destinations of the quest steps will change reflecting on the current rotation of both the planetary Ascendant Anchors and / or the Shattered Realm mission that’s currently active.

This also applied to Season of the Splicer, which is why you’re still seeing Mithrax’s room of operations in the H.E.L.M. This is all part of Bungie’s attempts to address FOMO (fear of missing out), allowing you to continue to play previous activities for longer, even if later seasons shift their focus to new ones.\n","wordCount":"1894","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-05T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-05T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sadie Dreyer"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/destiny-2-wayfinder-s-voyage-quest-steps-how-to-complete-the-weekly-seasonal-quest/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Destiny 2 Wayfinder S Voyage Quest Steps How To Complete The Weekly Seasonal Quest</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-05 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 5, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1894 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Sadie Dreyer</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>Similar to Path of the Splicer during Season of the Splicer, this introduces a long-term plan to the season&rsquo;s new activities and features, with each week tasking you with using the Wayfinder&rsquo;s Compass, collecting Parallax Trajectory, and more.

Provided you&rsquo;ve started Wayfinder&rsquo;s Voyage while the quest was initially active, these steps - as well as all associated activities, including Astral Alignments and Shattered Realm missions - will remain in the game until the end of Season 15, or until the start of &lsquo;Year 5&rsquo; when The Witch Queen expansion arrives.
This also applied to Season of the Splicer, which is why you&rsquo;re still seeing Mithrax&rsquo;s room of operations in the H.E.L.M. This is all part of Bungie&rsquo;s attempts to address FOMO (fear of missing out), allowing you to continue to play previous activities for longer, even if later seasons shift their focus to new ones.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/destiny_2_wayfinders_voyage_explainer.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/destiny_2_wayfinders_voyage_explainer.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Destiny 2 Wayfinder s Voyage quest steps  How to complete the weekly seasonal quest -
