Three titles are chosen: Flight Simulator, A Plague Tale: Requiem and F1 22. Each game offers up varying performance differentials but the bottom line is that a notional 29 percent increase in cost against the RTX 3080 delivered a minimum 11 percent of extra performance at native 4K resolution (A Plague Tale: Requiem) and a maximum 24 percent in F1 22. DLSS 3 is used to beef up the numbers in favour of the new Ada Lovelace card - but while we’re excited by the technology, it’s not the finished article and its use in benchmarks isn’t a great move, not least because only a few DLSS 3 titles are available. Whichever way you look at the RTX 3080 12GB, the spectre of the RTX 3080 looms too large.\rThere’s clear water between RTX 4080 16GB and the existing Ampere line-up, but even so, there remain some strange figures in the Nvidia numbers. Quite how RTX 4090 can deliver nigh-on twice the performance of the 4080 16GB in A Plague Tale: Requiem continues to baffle the DF team - the specs don’t back that up. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s F1 figures suggest that the RTX 4090 is 38 percent faster than the RTX 4080 16GB - and yet the card is 33 percent more expensive. Flight Simulator scores show only a small advantage for the RTX 4090, but we can safely assume that the game is CPU-limited at that point, making the benchmarks of little value. Regardless, cancelling the RTX 4080 12GB at least means that the higher-end model won’t have its thunder stolen by the lower-end card that Nvidia itself now admits should not have received the 4080 moniker. Ultimately, we have the right move from Nvidia here and we should expect the RTX 4080 12GB to return with the 4070 or 4070 Ti branding it should have had from the beginning. The question is whether it’ll slot into Nvidia’s existing plans with a new name, or whether the entire stack of upcoming GPUs will be renamed/rebranded to take into account an audience that has clearly has expectations in terms of price vs performance. It’s a drama that stands in stark contrast to the success of the RTX 4090 - which sold out in hours despite its mammoth price-tag. Halo products always have some degree of protection against price vs performance scrutiny and stand alone - and we spend some time going over reaction to the product while answering a boat-load of questions about the new GPU flagship from backers of the DF Supporter Program. Miles Morales’ PC trailer? Nixxes is adding even more RT features to the game - and we talk about how far that can go, along with Sony’s refreshing attitude to its PC ports, where there’s no attempt to limit features to match PlayStation 5.\rAnd yes, we end with more DF Supporter questions - and it’s a great time to join us! Over the last week alone, we’ve delivered early access to new content, 4K 120fps gameplay of DLSS 3 in action, along with a comparison of DLSS 3 AI generated frames to standard rendered frames. Oh, and how about a peak into our work in adding 8K benchmarking to our video capture-based performance analysis tools? The DF Supporter Program is where it’s at if you love what we do… and we’ll be posting our brand-new Final Fantasy 13 DF Retro episode later this week. It’s amazing stuff.
