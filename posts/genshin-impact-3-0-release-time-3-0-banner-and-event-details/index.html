On this page:\nGenshin Impact 3.0 release time in UK, CEST, EDT and PDT Announced during the 3.0 livestream, developer miHoYo revealed that Genshin Impact 3.0 will release on Wednesday, 24th August, after approximately five hours of server downtime starting at 6am (UTC +8).\rAs this is only an approximate time for how long the servers are down, you might be able to play the 2.8 patch a little before or after the times below. Keeping this in mind, the Genshin Impact 3.0 release time for other time zones are as follows:\nUK: Wednesday, 24th August, 4am (BST) Europe: Wednesday, 24th August, 5am (CEST) East Coast US: Tuesday 23rd August, 11pm (EDT) Central US: Tuesday 23rd August, 10pm (CDT) West Coast US:Tuesday 23rd August, 8pm (PDT) Australia: Wednesday, 24th August, 1pm (AEST) New Zealand: Wednesday, 24th August, 3pm (NZST) Japan: Wednesday, 24th August, 12pm (JST)\nThe current update schedule for future Genshin Impact patches are as follows:\nVersion 3.1 - Wednesday, 28th September Version 3.2 - Wednesday, 2nd November Version 3.3 - Wednesday, 7th December\nIt’s important to remember that these dates may change. As for 3.0, you can pre-install some content now on PC and Mobile devices in advance to save time when the actual 3.0 patch is available on Wednesday. If you play on Mobile, either press the ‘Pre-Install Resource Package’ icon in the bottom-left corner of the login screen, or go to the Paimon Menu and select ‘Settings’, ‘Other’, and finally ‘Pre-Install Resource Package’. When the full update arrives, those on iOS devices must enter the App Store and tap ‘Update’. Android users can open the game and follow the directions on-screen or open Google Play and tap ‘Update’. If you play Genshin Impact on PC, you can pre-install some of the 3.0 update by updating the Genshin Impact Launcher. After updating the launcher, a ‘Game Pre-Installation’ button will appear to the left of the ‘Launch’ button. Click ‘Game Pre-Installation’ to download the 3.0 resources.\nGenshin Impact 3.0 Banners There are three new playable characters making their debut in the 3.0 update: Tighnari, Collei and Dori. Phase 1 begins with the Viridescent Vigil banner, which will feature 5-star Tighnari and 4-star Collei - who will have a high drop-rate boost. After the Version 3.1 update, Tighnari will be available through the standard wish, Wanderlust Invocation. The other Phase 1 banner is a rerun of Gentry of Hermitage, featuring 5-star character Zhongli. For this banner, 4-star Collei will still have her high drop-rate boost. As usual, the Phase 1 banners will run alongside each other and be available from Wednesday, 24th August. The Phase 1 Banners will then end on Friday, 9th September. In Phase 2, we have a rerun of Adrift in the Harbor, which features 5-Star character Ganyu and new Electro 4-Star Dori, and a rerun of Drifting Luminescence, which features 5-Star Sangonomiya Kokomi, and also has the new 4-Star Dori. All the new 4-Star and featured 5-Star characters you can Wish on during the 3.0 update are:\nTighnari (Viridescent Vigil Banner - Phase 1): New 5-Star Dendro character who uses a bow. Collei (Viridescent Vigil and Gentry of Hermitage Banner - Phase 1): New 4-Star Dendro character who uses a bow. Dori (Adrift in the Harbor and Drifting Luminescence Banner - Phase 2): New 4-Star Electro support character who uses a claymore. Zhongli (Gentry of Hermitage Banner - Phase 1): Returning 5-Star Geo character who uses a polearm weapon, and is best used in a support role due to his shielding abilities. Ganyu (Adrift in the Harbor Banner - Phase 2): Returning 5-Star Cryo archer, and is best used in a main or sub-DPS role due to her charged attack damage, AOE range, and Cryo application. Sangonomiya Kokomi (Drifting Luminescence Banner - Phase 2): Returning 5-Star Hydro catalyst user, and is best used in a support healing role.\nAs Zhongli has a Banner rerun during Phase 1, his signature weapon, Vortex Vanquisher, will have a boosted drop rate until until the Epitome Invocation weapon Banner refreshes for Phase 2 on Friday, 9th September. It’s not been announced yet what the Phase 2 5-Star featured weapons will be, but as Ganyu and Kokomi have reruns, their best weapons, Amos’ Bow and Everlasting Moonglow, respectively, are very likely to be featured. As a reminder, all the Phase 1 Banners will be available from Wednesday, 24th August and, will be switched out for the Phase 2 banners on Friday, 9th September. Phase 2 will then run until the time comes to prepare for the 3.1 update and a new set of Banners. Two new bows have also been announced for Genshin Impact 3.0, with the first being the 5-star Hunter’s Path. The second bow is the 4-star End of the Line. At the time of writing, all we know about this bow is that it will resemble a marlin and possibly even be made out of one… There’s also a new set of forgeable weapons all themed around the Sumeru region. These new craftable 4-Star weapons include one of each weapon type:\nKing’s Squire (bow) Sapwood Blade (sword) Moonpiercer (polearm) Forest Regalia (claymore) Fruit of Fufillment (catalyst)\nFinally, Genshin Impact 3.0 will introduce new Artifact sets - Deepwood Memories and Gilded Dreams. To obtain these new artifacts, you will have to challenge the new Domain of Blessing, Spire of Solitary Enlightenment. Genshin Impact version 3.3 is here, with new codes, and new character Scaramouche (Wanderer), so find out where he’s placed on our tier list. You’ll need Primogems and luck of the Pity and 50/50 systems to Wish with Fate for him and other current and next banners. You’ll also need the right Adventure Rank for events. For more Sumeru help, we’ve got pages on Sumeru Reputation, Tree of Dreams, Dendroculus locations, the Aeonblight Drake boss, the Garden of Endless Pillars Domain, and locations for Nilotpala Lotus, Padisarah, Scarabs, and Redcrest.\rYou can also now unlock the Genius Invokation TCG and, if you want help building your deck, check out our Genius Invokation TCG Card List.\rIf you want to relax, however, why not try fishing at one of the many fishing spot locations?\nGenshin Impact 3.0 events Much of Genshin Impact 3.0’s storyline still remains a mystery, but we do know it will involve travelling to the Sumeru region as part of the new Archon Quest Chapter 3: Act 1 ‘Through Mists of Smoke and Forests Dark’. Sumeru is famed for being a centre of learning, housing the Sumeru Akademiya, and, unsurprisingly its citizens worship the God of Wisdom, also known as the Lesser Lord Kusanali. Once this Archon Quest is completed, you will unlock the next one, Chapter 3: Act 2 ‘The Morn a Thousand Roses Brings’. Completing both parts of the new Archon storyline will then enable you to use a Story Key to unlock new character Tighnari’s Story Quest, ‘Vulpes Zerda Chapter’. There is also a host of time-limited events coming our way in Genshin Impact 3.0:\nGraven Innocence event The Graven Innocence event sees you assisting the staff of Acara Crafts, a toy store in Port Ormos, with developing new toys. Graven Innocence starts after the 3.0 update and ends before the servers go down for the 3.1 update (so approximately six weeks in length). To take part in Graven Innocence, you need to be at least Adventure Rank 20. It’s also recommended to complete ‘The Trail of the God of Wisdom’ in Archon Quest Chapter 3: Act I ‘Through Mists of Smoke and Forests Dark’ to appreciate the story, but is not necessary to take part in the event if you choose to ‘Quick Start’ it through the events submenu. Firstly, the event includes a tutorial quest - The Unappreciated Carving - which, when completed, will allow you to invite Collei to your team for free! This quest doesn’t require any additional criteria, and completing it will also unlock event types like ‘Meticulous Craftsmanship’, ‘Roaming the Jungle’, ‘Metamorphosis of Wood’, and more. Throughout the event, you’ll also be able to collect Creative Notes that you can exchange for a variety of rewards at the toy shop. Creative Notes can be found by completing a variety of activities, such as taking snapshots of the Sumeru wildlife, completing challenges, combat and Grove Dash - a form of magical parkour. These special events will be released in stages. The rewards you can receive from Graven Innocence include:\nPrimogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Crown of Insight Character Ascension Materials Character EXP Materials Talent Level-Up Materials\nFinally, you may find Whimscial Drafts, which can be exchanged for Carving Components that you can use to obtain a forest spirit woodcarving. You have until the end of the event to use your event currency and claim these rewards.\nLost Riches event The Lost Riches event in Genshin Impact starts on Friday, 2nd September and ends on Monday, 19th September. You must be Adventure Rank 20 or above to take part in Lost Riches. During this event, you’ll reunite with Ulman and his Mini Seelie for some treasure hunting! Take a Mini Seelie with you on your adventures and, with the help of Ulman’s Treasure Map, you’ll be able to dig up some lost treasure. Just remember to help the Mini Seelie absorb some elemental energy first. You’ll earn various rewards from digging up treasures chests - one of which will be Ancient Iron Coins. These coins can be exchanged for even more rewards:\nA Mini Seelie gadget - Various colours on offer Primogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Character EXP Materials Talent Level-Up Materials Weapon Ascension Materials\nFayz Trails event The Fayz Trails event in Genshin Impact starts on Thursday, 8th September and ends on Monday, 26th September. You must be Adventure Rank 20 or above, and have completed the Prologue: Act 3 quest ‘Song of the Dragon and Freedom’. Fayz Trails is the first challenge event to occur during Genshin Impact 3.0 and, during it, you’ll be playing with a whole trial party. When battling enemies during this event, you’ll be able to drink a special Fayz Potion, which will freeze both you and your enemies. It will give you the time, however, to capture your opponent’s weaknesses via the Viewfinder and, by doing so, your special skills will be enhanced. You’ll also gather Fayz Tinctures by defeating enemies, which will allow you to gain up to three uses of the Fayz Potion. The rewards you can earn from this event include:\nPrimogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Character EXP Materials Character Ascension Materials Weapon Ascension Materials\nTablet Analytics event At the time of writing, we don’t know the start and end date for the Tablet Analytics event or whether you must meet a set of requirements to partake. Tablet Analytics is also a challenge event, but this one focuses on using buffs to defeat your enemies. Each trail contains three rounds of challenges, during which you need to defeat as many enemies as possible while utilising a special mechanism to randomly activiate one or more buffs. You can use your own team or a selection of trial characters in these event challenges. The rewards you can earn from the Tablet Analytics event include:\nPrimogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Furnishing: Cauldron of Herbs Character EXP Materials Talent Level-Up Materails\nLey Line Overflow event At the time of writing, we don’t know exactly when the Ley Line Overflow event will return or if you’ll need to meet any requirements to partake in it. This event offers you the chance to farm for resources, which will help make your characters more powerful. Each event lasts a limited amount of time, so make sure you’re regularly logging in to earn all the rewards you can during the Genshin Impact 3.0 event schedule.\rHave fun during The Morn a Thousand Roses Brings update!\n","wordCount":"2071","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-28T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-28T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Marion Morrison"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/genshin-impact-3-0-release-time-3-0-banner-and-event-details/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Genshin Impact 3 0 Release Time 3 0 Banner And Event Details</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-28 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 28, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;10 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2071 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Marion Morrison</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#genshin-impact-30-release-time-in-uk-cest-edt-and-pdt>Genshin Impact 3.0 release time in UK, CEST, EDT and PDT</a></li><li><a href=#genshin-impact-30-banners>Genshin Impact 3.0 Banners</a></li><li><a href=#genshin-impact-30-events>Genshin Impact 3.0 events</a><ul><li><a href=#graven-innocence-event>Graven Innocence event</a></li><li><a href=#lost-riches-event>Lost Riches event</a></li><li><a href=#fayz-trails-event>Fayz Trails event</a></li><li><a href=#tablet-analytics-event>Tablet Analytics event</a></li><li><a href=#ley-line-overflow-event>Ley Line Overflow event</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Along with the new Sumeru region and Dendro element, there will be two Banner phases and new time-limited events in the latest update, with the Genshin Impact 3.0 Banners featuring new Sumeru 5-Star and 4-Stars, and some returning S-tier characters.

Genshin Impact version 3.3 is here, with new codes, and new character Scaramouche (Wanderer), so find out where he&rsquo;s placed on our tier list.
You&rsquo;ll need Primogems and luck of the Pity and 50/50 systems to Wish with Fate for him and other current and next banners. You&rsquo;ll also need the right Adventure Rank for events. For more Sumeru help, we&rsquo;ve got pages on Sumeru Reputation, Tree of Dreams, Dendroculus locations, the Aeonblight Drake boss, the Garden of Endless Pillars Domain, and locations for Nilotpala Lotus, Padisarah, Scarabs, and Redcrest.
You can also now unlock the Genius Invokation TCG and, if you want help building your deck, check out our Genius Invokation TCG Card List.
If you want to relax, however, why not try fishing at one of the many fishing spot locations?</p><h2 id=genshin-impact-30-events>Genshin Impact 3.0 events<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-30-events>#</a></h2><p>Much of Genshin Impact 3.0&rsquo;s storyline still remains a mystery, but we do know it will involve travelling to the Sumeru region as part of the new Archon Quest Chapter 3: Act 1 &lsquo;Through Mists of Smoke and Forests Dark&rsquo;. Sumeru is famed for being a centre of learning, housing the Sumeru Akademiya, and, unsurprisingly its citizens worship the God of Wisdom, also known as the Lesser Lord Kusanali.
Once this Archon Quest is completed, you will unlock the next one, Chapter 3: Act 2 &lsquo;The Morn a Thousand Roses Brings&rsquo;. Completing both parts of the new Archon storyline will then enable you to use a Story Key to unlock new character Tighnari&rsquo;s Story Quest, &lsquo;Vulpes Zerda Chapter&rsquo;.
There is also a host of time-limited events coming our way in Genshin Impact 3.0:</p><h3 id=graven-innocence-event>Graven Innocence event<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#graven-innocence-event>#</a></h3><p>The Graven Innocence event sees you assisting the staff of Acara Crafts, a toy store in Port Ormos, with developing new toys. Graven Innocence starts after the 3.0 update and ends before the servers go down for the 3.1 update (so approximately six weeks in length). To take part in Graven Innocence, you need to be at least Adventure Rank 20.
It&rsquo;s also recommended to complete &lsquo;The Trail of the God of Wisdom&rsquo; in Archon Quest Chapter 3: Act I &lsquo;Through Mists of Smoke and Forests Dark&rsquo; to appreciate the story, but is not necessary to take part in the event if you choose to &lsquo;Quick Start&rsquo; it through the events submenu.
Firstly, the event includes a tutorial quest - The Unappreciated Carving - which, when completed, will allow you to invite Collei to your team for free! This quest doesn&rsquo;t require any additional criteria, and completing it will also unlock event types like &lsquo;Meticulous Craftsmanship&rsquo;, &lsquo;Roaming the Jungle&rsquo;, &lsquo;Metamorphosis of Wood&rsquo;, and more.
Throughout the event, you&rsquo;ll also be able to collect Creative Notes that you can exchange for a variety of rewards at the toy shop. Creative Notes can be found by completing a variety of activities, such as taking snapshots of the Sumeru wildlife, completing challenges, combat and Grove Dash - a form of magical parkour. These special events will be released in stages.
The rewards you can receive from Graven Innocence include:</p><p>Primogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Crown of Insight Character Ascension Materials Character EXP Materials Talent Level-Up Materials</p><p>Finally, you may find Whimscial Drafts, which can be exchanged for Carving Components that you can use to obtain a forest spirit woodcarving. You have until the end of the event to use your event currency and claim these rewards.</p><h3 id=lost-riches-event>Lost Riches event<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#lost-riches-event>#</a></h3><p>The Lost Riches event in Genshin Impact starts on Friday, 2nd September and ends on Monday, 19th September. You must be Adventure Rank 20 or above to take part in Lost Riches.
During this event, you&rsquo;ll reunite with Ulman and his Mini Seelie for some treasure hunting! Take a Mini Seelie with you on your adventures and, with the help of Ulman&rsquo;s Treasure Map, you&rsquo;ll be able to dig up some lost treasure. Just remember to help the Mini Seelie absorb some elemental energy first.
You&rsquo;ll earn various rewards from digging up treasures chests - one of which will be Ancient Iron Coins. These coins can be exchanged for even more rewards:</p><p>A Mini Seelie gadget - Various colours on offer Primogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Character EXP Materials Talent Level-Up Materials Weapon Ascension Materials</p><h3 id=fayz-trails-event>Fayz Trails event<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#fayz-trails-event>#</a></h3><p>The Fayz Trails event in Genshin Impact starts on Thursday, 8th September and ends on Monday, 26th September. You must be Adventure Rank 20 or above, and have completed the Prologue: Act 3 quest &lsquo;Song of the Dragon and Freedom&rsquo;.
Fayz Trails is the first challenge event to occur during Genshin Impact 3.0 and, during it, you&rsquo;ll be playing with a whole trial party.
When battling enemies during this event, you&rsquo;ll be able to drink a special Fayz Potion, which will freeze both you and your enemies. It will give you the time, however, to capture your opponent&rsquo;s weaknesses via the Viewfinder and, by doing so, your special skills will be enhanced.
You&rsquo;ll also gather Fayz Tinctures by defeating enemies, which will allow you to gain up to three uses of the Fayz Potion.
The rewards you can earn from this event include:</p><p>Primogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Character EXP Materials Character Ascension Materials Weapon Ascension Materials</p><h3 id=tablet-analytics-event>Tablet Analytics event<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tablet-analytics-event>#</a></h3><p>At the time of writing, we don&rsquo;t know the start and end date for the Tablet Analytics event or whether you must meet a set of requirements to partake.
Tablet Analytics is also a challenge event, but this one focuses on using buffs to defeat your enemies. Each trail contains three rounds of challenges, during which you need to defeat as many enemies as possible while utilising a special mechanism to randomly activiate one or more buffs. You can use your own team or a selection of trial characters in these event challenges.
The rewards you can earn from the Tablet Analytics event include:</p><p>Primogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Furnishing: Cauldron of Herbs Character EXP Materials Talent Level-Up Materails</p><h3 id=ley-line-overflow-event>Ley Line Overflow event<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ley-line-overflow-event>#</a></h3><p>At the time of writing, we don&rsquo;t know exactly when the Ley Line Overflow event will return or if you&rsquo;ll need to meet any requirements to partake in it. This event offers you the chance to farm for resources, which will help make your characters more powerful.
Each event lasts a limited amount of time, so make sure you’re regularly logging in to earn all the rewards you can during the Genshin Impact 3.0 event schedule.
Have fun during The Morn a Thousand Roses Brings update!</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Genshin_Impact_3_Release_Date_10.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Genshin_Impact_3_Release_Date_10.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact 3 0 release time  3 0 Banner and event details -
