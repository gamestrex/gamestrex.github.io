Use Miniguns to clean up the remainder of the Ridden and Mutations if it is required. It should just be 2 minutes before you get 52 Supply Points. Delete Run and repeat as necessary.\nWe need to save the entire grenade damage output.\nDemolitioners expert: 50 % damage to the ground, -12 % damage to the ground. Improvised Explosives: Seven5% Damage from Accessory, tenths p.m. Bomb Squad: total explosive damage, 34.5% explosive resistance. Grainade training: 25% damages for accessibility.

On Recruit, pick Act 1 \u003e Search and Rescue \u003e Barroom Blitz level. You can play it on Veteran, but if you don’t build any proper decks, it’s going to be difficult. And this second method will work, so far as to eliminate the virtually endless amount of cards that are used to save it. Take the Jukebox, then hide it behind the bar. We suggest you do a melee training. Check them out on our deck building guide. Kill those zombies till the level begins. You only need a few minutes to make 44 supply points.
