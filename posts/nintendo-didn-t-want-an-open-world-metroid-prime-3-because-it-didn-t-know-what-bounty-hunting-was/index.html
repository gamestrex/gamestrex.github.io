However, speaking to YouTube channel DidYouKnowGaming, new details have surfaced.
Metroid Prime 3 was planned to involve open world bounty hunting, but Walker has now set the record straight on what exactly that would have entailed.
&ldquo;We were not proposing in any way, shape, or form - even in our wildest dreams - that we would have like Metroid Prime Skyrim&mldr; we were not talking about 200 hour side quests or anything like that,&rdquo; he told DidYouKnowGaming.
