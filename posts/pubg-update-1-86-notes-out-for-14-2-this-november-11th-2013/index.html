It is also effective when it’s destroying vehicles. Specifically, you can use various strategies in cooperative play. Also, remember to use these strategy in battle!\nOnce looted it takes up a small slot. Deployment It can be deployed only on flat surfaces. It can’t be mounted on cement, iron, concrete, water or wooden floors, or in buildings. To deploy the Mortar, press RT/Stadia/R2/PlayStation button. Press on the Xbox/Stadia/PlayStation button to cancel the deployment. It takes three seconds for deployment. Firing The character instantly cries when the firing mode activates. The character can’t move until the firing mode becomes available. You must have ammo in your arsenal to fire. The fires are shortening in one second. Modes Normal Match Custom Match I wasn’t included in the year 14 with the list, but in the list of best-rated season. Spawn Mortar and ammo spawn in buildings. In sylvains, there’s not a nest in the tank or in the secret room. It can shoot anywhere from 121 to 700 metres. Controls\nStatus Action Deploy Mode Select a special type of weapon to select from. Is this the Mode of Cancellation? Turn on the weapon, so that you can move to a weapon. Deployment Go to the designated deployment surface on Demolition Mode and press RT (Xbox/Stadia)/R2 (PlayStation). Cancel Deployment Press X (Xbox/Stadia)/ (PlayStation) (Xbox/Stadia)/ (PlayStation). Firing Mode Press the X – Box/Stadia) – PlayStation. The height of the weights must be adjusted to be raised.

RB and R-Stick (Xbox/Stadia)- R1 + R-Stick (PlayStation) Firing RT (Xbox/Stadia)- R2 (PlayStation) New Weapon: M79. Our new M79 is a smoke grenade launcher that was created to provide quick smoke cover on long ranges. Blind your enemies, to cover your incompetent teammate or to try to escape a losing battle! I have found a new weapon: No one is able to find M79 in Taego, but in all eight maps.\nWeapons: Pistols: Weapons: Computers: Pistols: One can’t use a car’s driving seat. New tyre: 40mm Smoke Grenade. If it hit an object more than 10 metres away, it will release the first smoke effect. Afterwards, a second one will come out. After hitting the object which is less than 10 metres distant and fails to explode on impact, only the second smoke effect will be released after 3 seconds. Weight: 14 lbs. He has 5,500 lbs. World-spawns in a pile of 1, 3, 3 and 1. World spawns in stacks of 2 and 3 along with the M79. Available Modes Normal Matches Custom Matches Don’t be available in training mode to prevent players from getting interfered with by the smoke effect. We will be thinking of adding it in later updates. Spawn Location World spawn Death to enemies: 0 3 o’clock – 8 o’clock – ’00 Reloading speed: 3,5 m 4 seconds.\nNew Feature: DBNO swimming. To reduce the damage caused by playing players in the water, we’re supporting the DBNO Swim. Previously, a player who enters DBNO while standing in the water would skip DBNO and die instantly. In this case, deep water was a hazardous area to enter. Now a player will enter Swimming DBNO, a slow swimming state that gives a player the chance to reach the shore and to be revived by teammates. I hope you feel more confident when you arrive in an escapade or when you swim across that river!\nDBNO Players can swim half the normal speed. The air and humidity in the lungs of a player isn’t reset when entering DBNO, therefore a player who is drowning will continue to go to DBNO. In DBNO players continue to lose HP. Combining with drowning HP loss, a player will die under 10 seconds. Reviving underwater is impossible, and any current revive is canceled when either player goes underwater or moves around too much. Playing on water is a chance to revive a swimming DBNO player.\nWorld The recipe for taegos is chicken. We’re proud to introduce the Chicken, a new creature who could be of a great attraction for many players in the toughest combat of Taego! Chicken? You might ask why I was talking, are you? This question is about your imagination.\nThree different conditions are applicable: Calm This is a default and, at the same time, the stable emotional state. The word “shamm” means nothing special. Fear Chickens fly, not, in the following situations for their lives. When hearing Death Unfortunately all of this happens now. When hit, both deer and taegos amusers pass away. They kill guns and grenades, and then turn to fried chicken. Sorry, a bad joke, they go to all of us.\nCustom Match In custom match, the team have added five new Taego areas.\nPalace Field Market Mountain Shipyard\nArcade Mode Team Deathmatch has improved on the field.\nMarket The initial spawn points have been altered from left/right to top/bottom. The number of spawning points that lead to the roof has been reduced. Mountain We have reduced the number of spawn points on the left side of the area. The distance between the remaining spawn points has been pushed in about 30 metres.\nArcade Mode Toll-free shirts on the day of the event.\nMarket Both teams changed their initial spawn points from left/right to top/bottom. The number of spawn points causing the roof has been reduced. Mountain The number of spawn points on the left side of the area has been lowered. The distance between the other spawn points has been increased to 30 meters.\nRanked Mode Since community feedback has been taken, we have adjusted the Taego and Paramo rulesets and the spawn tables to suit the Ranked play experience.\nTaego Adjusted the Blue Zone to fit a map of 8 km. The following characteristics will not be supported: Emergency Landing Emergency Pickup Comeback BR Secret Room Error Space There are no such items as this one. Emergency Pickup Self-adjustment is prohibited. The key digit of the secret room. M79 Mortar C4 Blue zone grenade, blue zone. Spike Trap Paramo Each Blue Zone phase increased its size and the speed of moving. From those 21 minutes previous, the playtime was reduced to 18 minutes. The more items are spawned. Some of these features will not be supported. Secret room key. Panzerfaust 8x Scope\nA sport, PGC 2021\nThe esport menu is updated for the International Games 2021. Overview Tab Shows live news and schedules. Explains tournament structure. Explains Pickem and live streaming event. Standings Tab Shows team ranked in every match.\nThe past Halloween theme has been removed and replaced by the PGC 2021 theme for Normal, Custom, and Ranked Matches. The theme will be about to be realised based on the following. Main lobby Plane banner Erangel/Miramar/Vikendi building graffiti is a must.\nUI/UX Improvements. The PUBG Lobby contains an ACT – the Krafton ID – (Read More About it)\nWe will put in a button on the profile overview page to add your PUBG account and Krafton ID. With that update, the PUBG account can be directly connected to Krafton ID from the lobby.\nProfile Overview Before, the Career page was used to screen the profile screen. As soon as you look at other players, it was difficult to recognize their status. It also was hard to identify who they were while watching other players’ profiles. Here’s why we want to give you a profil overview that shows that you could easily see yourself and other players’ status instantly. You could show off your fashion sense and skin!\nYou can find a summary of your current season’s forecasts in Career Summary. You can determine the final match, team mode and season summary information when you play in the present season. Current survival levels, last killed weapon mastery information, and last obtained medal information are displayed. The summary of the season’s performance will be shown in other players’ profiles. In the same way as in the previous record profile, records, adding friends and joining teams are allowed to record before. You can copy pictures, names and names, and medals. There may be some time after match to reflect the stats.\nQoL Improvements Dynamic Blue Zone Message!\nThe Dynamic Blue Zone function follows the number of survivors per phase in some maps. A guiding message will be displayed so that players can be aware of it. We have a car: Sanhok, Karakin. Dynamic Bluezone Activation Conditions: 2nd Phase: Activated when less than 30 survivors survive. Third phase: There are 10 survivors active with no more than 18 survivors. The 4th phase of study is Activated when there are less than 10 survivors. 5th phase: Activated when there aren’t more than three survivors. 6th phase: Activated if 3 survivors have not survived. The following message will be displayed. The Blue Zone delay has been reduced because of a reduction in the survival rate.\nParamo Minimap on Unplayable Areas Improvements are made by nonplayable areas. The mini-map is fully redesigned and made it clearer in the map. Store\nWhen a nameplate is bought, changed the navigation path on the drop-down screen. The body message of the pop-up window has been changed accordingly. The main image for single items will also be shown now. Any purchased items will be sent to the end of the catalog. Unfortunately, items that can be repurchased don’t go to the store. A wall background has been added to Spray item previews.\nSurvivor Pass update.

The issue is that if you use self-advantage on the ground after being taken in by the pool, you get killed instantly when there are no teammates.\nBug Fixes Gameplay\nI was unable to hold up a DBNOed player after he shut down the building door. Fixed the issue of being unable to protect or kill a DBNOed enemy, who has disconnected from the game. Fixed the problem of being unable to revive a teammate who’s disconnected from the game. Fixed the issue of being unable to scroll back up in the list of dead players. Fixed the issue of a players crosshair not disappearing when switching to Freecam View in Observer mode. Were players unable to see the team list on the world map on any way? Having a player go through a certain step, a player got to feel the need to shoot in the driver’s seat. Remediating the problem of a regular kill message popping up instead of a teamkill message when a teammate kills a teammate. Fixed the issue of Sticky Bombs and C4s being the attachment of a player whose cars are parked. The suspension accident caused the car, and he was in a position to avoid the crash. Fixed the volume issue with the occurrence of not affected Panzerfausts and grenades even when the game volume is lowered. The cancel error message that pops up during matchmaking has been fixed. The issue of a player’s weapon being holstered after a player gets off the vehicle and uses the healer’s in the drivers seat. Fixed the issue of the possibility that an observer could hear gunshots from a player who isn’t shooting.\nWorld\nFixed some genus problems in Erangel and Paramo.\nUI\nFixed the perspective of change from TPP to FPP when an additional player joins a solo/Duo party and changes mode to Squad mode. Fixed the issue of the number AUG being shown as AUG_A3 in the Weapons filter menu of the Customize tab. The awkward transition issue posed when it came to moving from Overview to Career. Fixed the issue of level and BATTLESTAT overlapping on progressioni symbol icons in the Obtained Weapon window. Fixed the issue of the key on the bottom of the Ranked mode with the onset of a break in the English language.\nFood and health / skins / etc. Cutting issue: Photographs that are shown outside the visible part of a photograph.\nThe clipping problem happened when female characters equip Floptop Hoodie with a Hindsight Shirt, Golf Polo Shirt or Dress Shirt and Tie. When preparing to wear Moonseeker boots, fix the issue of the transparent ankle. The sleeve-less top fits in the cardigan’s hair and it wears in the middle. When infecting Midnight Equalizer Jacket with Skullface Stunt Gloves, the glove clipping issue was fixed. Fixed the clipping problem with a SPF, that infected females fitted JENNIEs BLACKPINK Leggings with PGI.S Tactical Pants. Why’s this fucking problem fixing? The result is fixed when women claps Cheerleader Top with a Floptop Hoodie. The color of Night Hunter Masks looking different from the store banner.\nSource: Reddit.\n","wordCount":"2619","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-04T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Loretta Cortez"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/pubg-update-1-86-notes-out-for-14-2-this-november-11th-2013/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Pubg Update 1 86 Notes Out For 14 2 This November 11Th 2013</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 4, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2619 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Loretta Cortez</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#pubg-update-186-notes>PUBG Update 1.86 Notes:</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h3 id=pubg-update-186-notes>PUBG Update 1.86 Notes:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pubg-update-186-notes>#</a></h3><p>New Weapon: Mortar

New Weapon: M79.
Our new M79 is a smoke grenade launcher that was created to provide quick smoke cover on long ranges. Blind your enemies, to cover your incompetent teammate or to try to escape a losing battle!
I have found a new weapon: No one is able to find M79 in Taego, but in all eight maps.</p><p>Weapons: Pistols: Weapons: Computers: Pistols: One can’t use a car’s driving seat. New tyre: 40mm Smoke Grenade. If it hit an object more than 10 metres away, it will release the first smoke effect. Afterwards, a second one will come out. After hitting the object which is less than 10 metres distant and fails to explode on impact, only the second smoke effect will be released after 3 seconds. Weight: 14 lbs. He has 5,500 lbs. World-spawns in a pile of 1, 3, 3 and 1. World spawns in stacks of 2 and 3 along with the M79. Available Modes Normal Matches Custom Matches Don’t be available in training mode to prevent players from getting interfered with by the smoke effect. We will be thinking of adding it in later updates. Spawn Location World spawn Death to enemies: 0 3 o’clock – 8 o’clock – ’00 Reloading speed: 3,5 m 4 seconds.</p><p>New Feature: DBNO swimming.
To reduce the damage caused by playing players in the water, we’re supporting the DBNO Swim. Previously, a player who enters DBNO while standing in the water would skip DBNO and die instantly. In this case, deep water was a hazardous area to enter. Now a player will enter Swimming DBNO, a slow swimming state that gives a player the chance to reach the shore and to be revived by teammates. I hope you feel more confident when you arrive in an escapade or when you swim across that river!</p><p>DBNO Players can swim half the normal speed. The air and humidity in the lungs of a player isn’t reset when entering DBNO, therefore a player who is drowning will continue to go to DBNO. In DBNO players continue to lose HP. Combining with drowning HP loss, a player will die under 10 seconds. Reviving underwater is impossible, and any current revive is canceled when either player goes underwater or moves around too much. Playing on water is a chance to revive a swimming DBNO player.</p><p>World
The recipe for taegos is chicken.
We’re proud to introduce the Chicken, a new creature who could be of a great attraction for many players in the toughest combat of Taego! Chicken? You might ask why I was talking, are you? This question is about your imagination.</p><p>Three different conditions are applicable: Calm This is a default and, at the same time, the stable emotional state. The word “shamm” means nothing special. Fear Chickens fly, not, in the following situations for their lives. When hearing Death Unfortunately all of this happens now. When hit, both deer and taegos amusers pass away. They kill guns and grenades, and then turn to fried chicken. Sorry, a bad joke, they go to all of us.</p><p>Custom Match
In custom match, the team have added five new Taego areas.</p><p>Palace Field Market Mountain Shipyard</p><p>Arcade Mode
Team Deathmatch has improved on the field.</p><p>Market The initial spawn points have been altered from left/right to top/bottom. The number of spawning points that lead to the roof has been reduced. Mountain We have reduced the number of spawn points on the left side of the area. The distance between the remaining spawn points has been pushed in about 30 metres.</p><p>Arcade Mode
Toll-free shirts on the day of the event.</p><p>Market Both teams changed their initial spawn points from left/right to top/bottom. The number of spawn points causing the roof has been reduced. Mountain The number of spawn points on the left side of the area has been lowered. The distance between the other spawn points has been increased to 30 meters.</p><p>Ranked Mode
Since community feedback has been taken, we have adjusted the Taego and Paramo rulesets and the spawn tables to suit the Ranked play experience.</p><p>Taego Adjusted the Blue Zone to fit a map of 8 km. The following characteristics will not be supported: Emergency Landing Emergency Pickup Comeback BR Secret Room Error Space There are no such items as this one. Emergency Pickup Self-adjustment is prohibited. The key digit of the secret room. M79 Mortar C4 Blue zone grenade, blue zone. Spike Trap Paramo Each Blue Zone phase increased its size and the speed of moving. From those 21 minutes previous, the playtime was reduced to 18 minutes. The more items are spawned. Some of these features will not be supported. Secret room key. Panzerfaust 8x Scope</p><p>A sport, PGC 2021</p><p>The esport menu is updated for the International Games 2021. Overview Tab Shows live news and schedules. Explains tournament structure. Explains Pickem and live streaming event. Standings Tab Shows team ranked in every match.</p><p>The past Halloween theme has been removed and replaced by the PGC 2021 theme for Normal, Custom, and Ranked Matches. The theme will be about to be realised based on the following. Main lobby Plane banner Erangel/Miramar/Vikendi building graffiti is a must.</p><p>UI/UX Improvements.
The PUBG Lobby contains an ACT – the Krafton ID – (Read More About it)</p><p>We will put in a button on the profile overview page to add your PUBG account and Krafton ID. With that update, the PUBG account can be directly connected to Krafton ID from the lobby.</p><p>Profile Overview
Before, the Career page was used to screen the profile screen. As soon as you look at other players, it was difficult to recognize their status. It also was hard to identify who they were while watching other players’ profiles. Here’s why we want to give you a profil overview that shows that you could easily see yourself and other players’ status instantly. You could show off your fashion sense and skin!</p><p>You can find a summary of your current season’s forecasts in Career Summary. You can determine the final match, team mode and season summary information when you play in the present season. Current survival levels, last killed weapon mastery information, and last obtained medal information are displayed. The summary of the season’s performance will be shown in other players’ profiles. In the same way as in the previous record profile, records, adding friends and joining teams are allowed to record before. You can copy pictures, names and names, and medals. There may be some time after match to reflect the stats.</p><p>QoL Improvements
Dynamic Blue Zone Message!</p><p>The Dynamic Blue Zone function follows the number of survivors per phase in some maps. A guiding message will be displayed so that players can be aware of it. We have a car: Sanhok, Karakin. Dynamic Bluezone Activation Conditions: 2nd Phase: Activated when less than 30 survivors survive. Third phase: There are 10 survivors active with no more than 18 survivors. The 4th phase of study is Activated when there are less than 10 survivors. 5th phase: Activated when there aren’t more than three survivors. 6th phase: Activated if 3 survivors have not survived. The following message will be displayed. The Blue Zone delay has been reduced because of a reduction in the survival rate.</p><p>Paramo Minimap on Unplayable Areas Improvements are made by nonplayable areas.
The mini-map is fully redesigned and made it clearer in the map.
Store</p><p>When a nameplate is bought, changed the navigation path on the drop-down screen. The body message of the pop-up window has been changed accordingly. The main image for single items will also be shown now. Any purchased items will be sent to the end of the catalog. Unfortunately, items that can be repurchased don’t go to the store. A wall background has been added to Spray item previews.</p><p>Survivor Pass update.

The issue is that if you use self-advantage on the ground after being taken in by the pool, you get killed instantly when there are no teammates.</p><p>Bug Fixes
Gameplay</p><p>I was unable to hold up a DBNOed player after he shut down the building door. Fixed the issue of being unable to protect or kill a DBNOed enemy, who has disconnected from the game. Fixed the problem of being unable to revive a teammate who’s disconnected from the game. Fixed the issue of being unable to scroll back up in the list of dead players. Fixed the issue of a players crosshair not disappearing when switching to Freecam View in Observer mode. Were players unable to see the team list on the world map on any way? Having a player go through a certain step, a player got to feel the need to shoot in the driver’s seat. Remediating the problem of a regular kill message popping up instead of a teamkill message when a teammate kills a teammate. Fixed the issue of Sticky Bombs and C4s being the attachment of a player whose cars are parked. The suspension accident caused the car, and he was in a position to avoid the crash. Fixed the volume issue with the occurrence of not affected Panzerfausts and grenades even when the game volume is lowered. The cancel error message that pops up during matchmaking has been fixed. The issue of a player’s weapon being holstered after a player gets off the vehicle and uses the healer’s in the drivers seat. Fixed the issue of the possibility that an observer could hear gunshots from a player who isn’t shooting.</p><p>World</p><p>Fixed some genus problems in Erangel and Paramo.</p><p>UI</p><p>Fixed the perspective of change from TPP to FPP when an additional player joins a solo/Duo party and changes mode to Squad mode. Fixed the issue of the number AUG being shown as AUG_A3 in the Weapons filter menu of the Customize tab. The awkward transition issue posed when it came to moving from Overview to Career. Fixed the issue of level and BATTLESTAT overlapping on progressioni symbol icons in the Obtained Weapon window. Fixed the issue of the key on the bottom of the Ranked mode with the onset of a break in the English language.</p><p>Food and health / skins / etc.
Cutting issue: Photographs that are shown outside the visible part of a photograph.</p><p>The clipping problem happened when female characters equip Floptop Hoodie with a Hindsight Shirt, Golf Polo Shirt or Dress Shirt and Tie. When preparing to wear Moonseeker boots, fix the issue of the transparent ankle. The sleeve-less top fits in the cardigan’s hair and it wears in the middle. When infecting Midnight Equalizer Jacket with Skullface Stunt Gloves, the glove clipping issue was fixed. Fixed the clipping problem with a SPF, that infected females fitted JENNIEs BLACKPINK Leggings with PGI.S Tactical Pants. Why’s this fucking problem fixing? The result is fixed when women claps Cheerleader Top with a Floptop Hoodie. The color of Night Hunter Masks looking different from the store banner.</p><p>Source: Reddit.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/pokemon-go-bdsp-celebration-party-has-begun-tomorrow/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Pokemon Go Bdsp Celebration Party Has Begun Tomorrow</span></a>
