Make sure you take the whole game by chance and take each item or create a new save at the start of each chapter in case you don’t miss them. With that out of the way, a guide is set for all collectibles in Chapter 12. There are plenty of items that you will collect in thischapter that depend on them in previous chapters. These items are the Meditation Stone and Mourning Candle. Here are the guides for the previous levels.\nMeditations stone (Item) The Stone can be found in the Gamoras room, and should have been collected in chapter 10? Go there and talk with the item. The conversation will be facilitated by Gamora. Once the interaction was finished, the Stone collection is added to your item collection.\nThe Mourning Candle (subject) is a slightly damaged candle. The candle can be found in the living room of Draxs and should have been collected in chapter 10 of the room. Go go and talk to the item. You will start out with Drax, too. Once the interaction is done, the Candle collectible will be added to your item collection.\nA quick read of Guardians of the Galaxy’s fun time. Drax: Thanos IMPACT (Outfit) (Outfit) Upon returning to Knowhere and reaching the first fight on the landing pad, there is a crate in which can move Drax. Have her pull the structure out and climb to a height or three feet taller to find the fit.\nKnowhere Safe (Archive) Continue the ramp on the landing station and take off the critical path. The Guardians will comment on the Cosmos Tower and see a piece of high-studded cover you have to mantle over. The collection of the archives can be found in a yellow box before the link to the piece of cover.\nProphetic Convergence (Archive) Go down the elevator from the landing pad and right in front of you you will find a circular piece. The collection is located in the middle of the archive.\nRocket: The Guggle, outfit. After the battle on the market and the right of space you need to tap through the wall to progress, you should use the wind to force down a weak wall. The collectible outfit is behind it.\nEgghead Review: That’s Better (Archive)! From the very last saxophony, progress through the mission until you reach Mantlos Bar, or what’s out of it (Rocket is making a huge mistake about it). You’ll need to pull down a wall to allow the other Guardians to pass. If you want to cross the wall, turn left and start looking at the archive of an entire pallet of archive.\nResponse: Missing People Report (Archive). This chapter has you covered for that chapter, so you can find a set of wires that Gamora needs to cut. Go to the left from the wires to the front of the collector’s store, and you will find the collection from the Archives in front of the vending machine.\nGlarnot Mask (Guardian Collectionible). Go back to the left of the last collecting collection and slide down the ramp. If you are jumping, plug the void that is leaking poison gas, and you’ll find the masks assorted.\nGroot: scold-sea for the rotten sheep. Go back to the wire and have Gamora cut them. You need to cross a road and then you should help Drax by walking a obstacle. For the leaves above the debris, go right into the green cube. You are going to see a wall to grab as the wind enters. Pull down the wall and make it to Groot and create a bridge to cross. Use the Electric Element Shot to open the door and then turn the Rocket off the energy that is circulating in the water to block the way. On the right side of the platform, a collectible outfit will be found.\nGamora: Cut casually (Outfit) Continue through the chapter until you have to tell Drax to punch a hole on the ground. Look down and get into the hole where you could crawl. The costume from the corners of the tunnel will be found.\nStar-Lord: Apocalypse-Lord (Outfit) After you help Cosmo and go to combat, you will be forced to pull the wall with the wind element down. You’ll find a box that Drax can carry behind it. Take the platform left, then once on the platform, give Gamora assistance to the next level right. It looks like you are being shown the crate with your collectible dress.\nThe Investigation of the Head of the Head (Archive) Jump down to the platform that you were on before Gamora threw you up. Go along the left and enter the workbounded entrance. Give Groot a lift on the platform covered in vines. You will find the collectible document in the box where you jump off!\nWork-Related Death Reports (Archive) — Work Related Death Reports (Hands and Laws) — A document of labor related violence, death or death threats. Turn down the platform, and look into the workbench and go to right. You have to jump a few of the old stairs. If you are crossing the fence, go left and you’ll find a collection of books. Each of these links will become live as guides for the collected books that go up. The main game guide for the games is the title of chapter 4 in the following paragraphs: Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3, Chapter 4, Chapter 5, Chapter 6, Chapter 4, Chapter 8, Chapter 8, Chapter 10.

This chapter is compendium, six archives, one Guardian Collectible and five Outfits. Take note that any collectible related to the Compendium is missable because your progress is reset when you return to the chapter via Chapter Select. Make sure you take the whole game by chance and take each item or create a new save at the start of each chapter in case you don’t miss them. With that out of the way, a guide is set for all collectibles in Chapter 12.
There are plenty of items that you will collect in thischapter that depend on them in previous chapters. These items are the Meditation Stone and Mourning Candle. Here are the guides for the previous levels.</p><h3 id=meditations-stone-item-1>Meditations stone (Item)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#meditations-stone-item-1>#</a></h3><p>The Stone can be found in the Gamoras room, and should have been collected in chapter 10? Go there and talk with the item. The conversation will be facilitated by Gamora. Once the interaction was finished, the Stone collection is added to your item collection.</p><h3 id=the-mourning-candle-subject-is-a-slightly-damaged-candle-1>The Mourning Candle (subject) is a slightly damaged candle.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-mourning-candle-subject-is-a-slightly-damaged-candle-1>#</a></h3><p>The candle can be found in the living room of Draxs and should have been collected in chapter 10 of the room. Go go and talk to the item. You will start out with Drax, too. Once the interaction is done, the Candle collectible will be added to your item collection.</p><h3 id=a-quick-read-of-guardians-of-the-galaxys-fun-time-1>A quick read of Guardians of the Galaxy’s fun time.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#a-quick-read-of-guardians-of-the-galaxys-fun-time-1>#</a></h3><h3 id=drax-thanos-impact-outfit-outfit-1>Drax: Thanos IMPACT (Outfit) (Outfit)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#drax-thanos-impact-outfit-outfit-1>#</a></h3><p>Upon returning to Knowhere and reaching the first fight on the landing pad, there is a crate in which can move Drax.

Continue the ramp on the landing station and take off the critical path. The Guardians will comment on the Cosmos Tower and see a piece of high-studded cover you have to mantle over. The collection of the archives can be found in a yellow box before the link to the piece of cover.</p><h3 id=prophetic-convergence-archive-1>Prophetic Convergence (Archive)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#prophetic-convergence-archive-1>#</a></h3><p>Go down the elevator from the landing pad and right in front of you you will find a circular piece.
