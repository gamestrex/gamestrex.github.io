I planned a great outfit game. This is a subject that I dont know much about, so I’m currently learning about it while working on development. I hope I can make that happen by this time next year. The theme is the joy of life.

Kenichiro Tsukuda
Ambitions for 2023
In 2023 we will release several titles that we worked with companies that are creating. We hope to make this a year of constant effort and changes for the company.
Status Update
There are several books we are working on, but I wonder if I could announce them to the world soon. The situation is very vague, but we’re constantly creating good games. Please look forward to them.

Hironobu Sakaguchi
Ambition for 2023?
I thought I’d retire (Laughs), but decided to try to give it another go.
Status Update
I will always stop playing Final Fantasy XIV. Meet me in Eorzea. I’ve also started writing the scenario about a new title that will never be announced. That will be a dark fantasy.
LEVEL-5
Akihiro Hino
Two atoms of light for 2023 are needed.
LEVEL 5.5 is celebrating its 25th anniversary. In 2022, I feel like I personally gave Megaton Musashi my heart and soul, but in 2023 I’ll announce many new titles, and that’s why I hope to be a company. I’ll do everything I can to make our presence known.

Even though this is not an unanswered sport, it makes an interesting game. It will be a fun game to play with my children and grandchildren.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/jalopy-v1-104-drm-free-download/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Jalopy V1 104 Drm Free Download</span></a>
