As of November 11, 2021, the Elder Scrolls 5 is officially in the double-digits. Throughout the past 10 years, Skyrim has been the best sandbox setting for some of our favorite gaming stories, and northern Tamriel continues to try to be aggressive with dragons and vampires and to see how we can have such a huge amount of cheese wheels once again. It was the anniversary of a very great anniversary in which we kept in mind that adventures played as Hunter S. Tomcatson, a very different version of marriage, and a little more afloats in the atmosphere at random. Our favorite memories, in the time spent in Skyrim, are those we enjoy most. Jody Macgregor, AU/Weekend Editor: After finishing Skyrim, I started with a new character, a khajiit named Hunter S. Tomcatson. I avoided using quick trips, and we left to the other end of the country to the other, noticing how much the scenery is changing, from the autumnal Rift with its purple, berry roots and orange leaves to The Reach where it has a lot of darkness, gray stone and sorrow. A number of fires on the northern coast were discovered and I flew over the yard to investigate. I noticed a lumpy black object at the centre of the matter. There was a grimoire near there that contained the spell “Pine Cloak.” It seems to me that someone had a magical misfire. I had already played for hundreds of hours, but I hadn’t seen that little vignette before. The thing that sticks to me is the one where you wake up with a hangover and have to piece together your activities from the night prior, which is hardly right for me. Tim Clark, Brand Director: If you’re willing to indulge, I’ll have two favourite memories. The first loomed in time for the final. We decided that I didn’t want to leave Skyrim yet, so started building the highest weapons possible. That took me all the way up to 100 when I grew up with the addition of a few different buttons and cups for a quick start to my own pocket. A few days later, I expelled a daedric War Axe capable of one-shot any enemy in the game, including the end boss. At that time, I’ve lost interest in playing, which, in my opinion, is in the way we learn weapon balance. My most memorable time was around Christmas 2011, when I was playing together with my five-year-old niece as a co-pilot. She was instantly transfixed by the dragons and wanted to hold the PS3 controller. In order to continue to make some progress, we negotiated a settlement that allowed her to decide where we went in the world and whether we’d fight others who we encountered. I still have a wholesome co-op experience. Oh, and the most favourite memory of Skyrim is the prolonged fight I had with Bethesda to get the lag bug fixed in the PS3, the longer you played, but the longer you played. I wanted to play a lot of time. I regularly sounded at standard rate levels. That’s true love. Chris Livingston, Feature Producer: I have quite a few. But if I weren’t able to restrain me to the top three of the list, the one would spend several weeks walking around Skyrim (and literally walking because I was roleplaying a NPC in this ten-part series that I wrote called The Elder Strolls). I finally proposed to Ysolda for a chunk of dead mammoth to her. True love. I came to Riften, the ceremony began, as soon as she said that “I do.” She left the church. Before the ceremony was even going to close. Then she was left, and I didn’t see him again. You aren’t super romantic. It’s recorded here for the sake of the publicity and annoyance. The other two are tied up with my other character’s wife, Mjoll the Lioness. I tried to build a house in the Hearthfire extension. I was frustrated that I couldn’t find an axe on that wall anywhere. Finally, I saw an NPC named Sigurd using one; so I froze him in ice, hoping to bring it to him. Ojoll and I attacked Sigurd, then went apeshit and killed him. This caused immense chaos, and destruction with city guards, attacks on dragons, and a lot of death. I guess it doesn’t sound funny, but I didn’t even need an axe. That’s a little weird. And speaking of Mjoll, I grew curious about her inner life and so I took her across the map, and dismissed her, then robbed her for some days to see where she went. The stealth part didn’t go so well, stating at one time I was accidentally paralyzed, fell in the snow, and was walking right by me. Whoops. I know this seems like a blatant opportunity to repromote my old diaries but these memories are really fond memories of mine and I love the fact that Skyrim is such a flexible, open-ended sandbox that makes ill-conceived and unpredictable adventures like this so possible. We can’t forget this dragon to attack me and destroy a fence, but the dragon will never let it into an earthquake. The city that experienced a property damage turned up all inhabitants in the city on the spot, as long as they remained able to make a trip to the road. I’ve Hilled up a mountain chased by Smaug and his 50 little helpers thinking that it’s what I love about Bethesda games. Nat Clayton, Production Director: I don’t have a lot of Skyrim memories, but after sneezing at a polar bear so hard that its ragdoll entered a ragdoll feedback loop and a huge distance of miles through the space. Bethesda is not a physics player. Jacob Ridley, Senior Hardware Editor, when Skyrim came out, was at university, and my only real memory of that hazy time was having a “we bought Skyrim” party. Remind yourself of something more than anything happening on the golf course. It was still overdue. Morgan Park, Staff Writer. I used to play Skyrim on my PS3, which had several exciting consequences as long as you played it. I first started to adjust my load times nearly 10 o’clock. If I loaded my save into the open space, it was normally a wait limit of 90 second as long as a half hour after loading before the game reloaded after that 20 fps release. Eventually, I started to use these dull little gaps to make something productive. I could go to the bathroom, grab a snack or read an article before Skyrim could play! Most of the time, I’d just play a different game on my iPod Touch. To go in with a short list of names, please give it a call. That first few weeks of discovery was such a fun experience. And I don’t think that it’s that way before, even when it comes to the upcoming Bethesda Fallouts or many other open world games that have already released. Lauren Morton, Associate Editor: Over a year, I had known to play for a little more than ten hours of Skyrim, so that I could get distracted. I have been to Bleak Falls Barrow a lot. I dedicated myself to a full playthrough several years ago when I really livestreamed Twitch often. As I listened to the videos that my friends saved, I felt scared and embarrassed of Skyrim. A spinning, fan-like Dwemer trap frightened me. An ancient gem caused me a panic. I was afraid when a dragon swooped out of the sky and hailed the Khajiit Archer head first. Like Nat, I also once a bear an impressive distance. I’m apparently frightened about that too. When I accidentally shot a child at point-next-point and hit a child in the neck, I was shocked at that also. I swear about this. On the less sparse side, I had just read all the five books in game I had in-game to my friends. I won’t stop reading fantasy novels even during the game. Oh, but I’ve just remembered the Barenziah books a little, too.\n","wordCount":"1372","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Heidi Brooks"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/remembering-skyrim-our-fondest-memories-and-funniest-memories-of-the-legendary-rpg-come-to-life/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Remembering Skyrim Our Fondest Memories And Funniest Memories Of The Legendary Rpg Come To Life</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-29 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 29, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1372 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Heidi Brooks</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>(Bytoesda)
