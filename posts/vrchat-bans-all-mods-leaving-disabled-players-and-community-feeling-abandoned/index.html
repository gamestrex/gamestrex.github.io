They say they are now stuck with a game they cannot play, with no guidance on when the game will be made accessible to them and no guaranteed way of making sure their needs are being listened to. Members of the larger VRChat community have described the situation as feeling hostile due to the contradicting claims made in the updated blog post. Players say their concerns are not being taken into consideration as the update has been rolled out without any changes.
