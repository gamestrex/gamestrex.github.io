It saw Sharang revisiting a youth of pining for Dragon Age: Origins’ Alistair - “charming, funny, disarmingly oblivious, and hot” - as he explored the power of fan-creation.\r“Randy, technoliterate gaymers soon released mods turning the various romanceable NPCs in Dragon Age: Origins bisexual, including the himbo Grey Warden of my dreams,” Sharang recalled. “Finally, my hours of complimenting Alistair and offering him little presents would result in the much-desired gay sex scene. A win for my nineteen-year-old spank bank.” [ Read the full article here ]\nPride Week: Emi “Captain Fluke” on being the first openly trans esports caster Tuesday saw Eurogamer’s Ed Nightingale interview Emi “Captain Fluke” - esports’ first openly trans caster - about the past, present, and future of LGBTQ+ representation in the industry.\r“‘It’s definitely been an experience,’ says Emi. ‘[Abuse] happens on a sort of day to day basis. It’s something where…I hope [it’s] a lot of just 13/14 year olds that don’t truly hold those views, but just hold the idea that they want to say things to hurt people. They want to be edgy, they want to be confrontational. They’re teenagers, and they feel invincible. I also know that there is a big community that, although it might not be vocal every single day, they look towards me and they look towards the rest of the LGBTQ+ community, and they see someone to get behind.’” [ Read the full article here ]\nPride Week: Experiencing the inclusion of LGBTQIA+ characters in RuneScape Eurogamer guides editor Lottie Lynn picked up the Pride Week mantle on Tuesday afternoon with a personal piece charting her long relationship with massively multiplayer online game Runescape - one that’s lasted 16 years and counting - and exploring the MMO’s gradual shift toward becoming a welcoming space of queer inclusion.\r“One of the greatest strengths of MMORPGs is that they’re constantly evolving, from fixing graphical glitches to unveiling a new region, and the inclusion of LGBTQIA+ characters and their stories is part of this evolution,” explained Lottie. “I hope we continue to see them in RuneScape, not just for long-time queer players like myself, but newcomers too.” [ Read the full article here ]\nPride Week: On Difficult Queer Games On Wednesday, Eli Cugini revisited Christine Love’s acclaimed, if sometimes controversial, visual novel Ladykiller in a Bind, arguing for more tricky games about bad gays.\r“In a time where minorities are harassed as engaging in ‘cancel culture’ for wanting to disengage with media that insults and degrades them, it’s been made artificially difficult to talk about the joys of challenging art,” Eli wrote. “We need games that are ambitious and complicated enough to do things wrong in interesting ways, and for games that divorce queerness from a demand for good representation and ethical practice.” [ Read the full article here ]\nPride Week: Arcade Spirits: The New Challengers and exploring the joy in my bisexuality More visual novel goodness arrived on Wednesday afternoon from Alex Meehan, who shared her experiences playing the recently released Arcade Spirits: The New Challengers and a very personal account of how it helped her explore the joy in her bisexuality.\r“Despite including plot-lines that do centre around self-doubt and mental illness,” Alex wrote, “queer identities are never the cause of this in The New Challengers.

Here, Alex invited readers into the messy, glorious world of tabletop RPG Thirsty Sword Lesbians.\r“It can feel like a lot of pressure is placed on the queer community to act a certain way,” Alex wrote. “As a queer woman, I can sometimes feel very self-conscious about the way others might view me or the reflection my behaviour might have on the LGBTQ+ community at large. However, Thirsty Sword Lesbians actively encourages the kind of outlandish and theatrical actions I’d possibly shy away from in real life.
