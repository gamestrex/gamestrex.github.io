It’ll fare much better than the wrap-a-couple-of-shirts-around-it-and-bang-it-in-a-backpack approach. Here’s our selection of the best PS5 accessories you can get your hands on right now. We’ll continue to update this page with more recommendations over time. You can also keep an eye on our PS5 deals page for offers on all these and more. We’ve left links to the cheapest places you can grab one below. As for racing wheels, all of the most popular ones are compatible with the PS5. Our top pick has gotta be the Logitech G29, with precision steering, super responsive pedals and a hand-stitched leather cover on the wheel. If you’re after something a little cheaper, the Thrustmaster T150 is a decent choice, although the later models (T300RS) are much better. If you don’t have one already, you’ll also want a stand. There are loads out there, but this Dishot racing wheel stand is reasonably priced at £97. If you’re looking for something a little cheaper, the SteelSeries Arctis 1 wired headset is a decent alternative. It’s wired, but available for a fraction of the price of the Pulse headset. If you’d prefer something without wires, the Arctis 3 is a solid choice too, especially at £39.97. And if you’ve got no limits when it comes to prices, we’d recommend checking out Digital Foundry’s list of the best gaming headsets, many of which are compatible with the PS5.\nSteelSeries Arctis 1- £20 at Currys SteelSeries Arctis 3- £40 at Currys\nFor the time being, it’s worth noting that SSDs can only be used to store games, rather than playing them directly from the drive. The PS5 does have internal space for SSDs in its expansion bay, but it’s currently unusable until Sony updates the console and reveals which SSDs are supported. That means you’ll still have to spend time moving games to and from your external HDD or SSD every time you want to play them, but it’s still way quicker than re-downloading them every time. We’d recommend grabbing a larger-sized external hard drive or SSD rather than opting for a 1TB or 500GB one, especially as prices tend to get cheaper per TB the larger you go. HDDs are much cheaper than SSDs due to the slower transfer speeds, and if you’re interested in learning more about the various speeds that are on offer, we’d recommend reading Digital Foundry’s thoughts on the best PS5 SSD. That said, you don’t need to break the bank to get a decent charging station, and one of our top picks for a budget charging station is the OIVO PS5 Charging Station. There’s an LED on the front that lets you know when your controllers are fully charged, and there are two cables for charging from either the PS5 USB port or an external one. The link below also includes a voucher - don’t forget to add it. If you want an alternative charging station for a similar price, we’d recommend the Venom PS5 Charging Station. It’s not as durable as the OIVI, in our opinion, but you can save some extra money if you just want a dock for one controller. And if you’d rather place your trust in a first-party charging station, the official DualSense charging station carries an RRP of £24.99. You’ll struggle to find it any cheaper given how quickly it goes out of stock, but we’ve listed the retailers where you may be able to bag it below.\nDualSense Charging Station £25 at AO DualSense Charging Station - £24.99 at Very DualSense Charging Station - £24.99 at Game\nThe Khanka hard travel case is an affordable choice with separate compartments for your PS5, console stand, cables, DualSense controllers, and cables. For something with adjustable straps that’s a little easier to transport, as well as more padded on the inside, the USA Gear PS5 Case is a fantastic alternative. It is nearly triple the cost of the Khanka travel case, though!\nPS5 Travel Case for £39.99 USA Gear PS5 Travel Case for £99.99\nAnd if you just need a safer way to transport your DualSense controller and any cables you’re taking with you, we’d recommend the TiMOVO Carry Case. If you’ve got an Xbox One or Xbox Series X in the house, it’ll also fit your Xbox controllers nicely too. Before you start digging out your PS5 box, it didn’t come bundled with an ethernet cable. Unless you have a spare one kicking around the house that’s relatively new, you’ll need to buy a new one. Thankfully, they’re pretty cheap. It’s worth noting that most ethernet cables are different, so if the one you’re planning to use has been sitting in a drawer for the last ten years, it’s worth getting a new one that’s a minimum CAT5e. Make sure you check the length of the cable too, to make sure it covers the distance between your PS5 and the router (especially if your router is in a different part of your home). Don’t forget: Our dedicated PS5 deals page is also here to help you find a great deal on games, accessories and more. And if you haven’t managed to get your hands on a PS5 console yet, it should hopefully be a little easier when you bookmark our PS5 stock checker page. We’d also recommend following Jelly Deals on Twitter to stay up-to-date with the latest discounts and promotions in the world of video games and tech.\n","wordCount":"986","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-09T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-09T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Brenda Ulman"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/the-best-ps5-accessories-to-buy-in-2023/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>The Best Ps5 Accessories To Buy In 2023</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 9, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;986 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Brenda Ulman</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>If you haven&rsquo;t already, you might want to consider a charging station for your DualSense controllers given the rather paltry size of the charging cable that comes included with the console, which presumably doesn&rsquo;t stretch from your console to the sofa.
