This year, however, the ceremony will be in-person and will broadcast live from Santa Monica, California, on Saturday, March 6, 2022.
Nomadland is a top 2021 Independent Spirit Awards category, full list of winners.
In the announcement video, Welsh reminded me that for a film or series of films to be eligible for a Spirit Award, its budget was not exceeding $22.5 million.
