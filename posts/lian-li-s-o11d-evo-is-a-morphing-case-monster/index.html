Lian Li will also offer five kits for the O11D EVO, which allow you to move the front IO to the top (where the honest should happen on a large case); replace the glass panels with mesh for much better airflow; or double up on those front/side-facing USB ports (which you’ll need a motherboard two front headers for that). There are two kits for showing your graphics card. The Vertical GPU Kit (somewhat confusingly) lets you mount your best graphics card. Take care of the back of the case, or then run the horizontally. The Upright GPU kit houses your graphics card in a vertical angle on the front of the case. I mean, O11D is an electronic transmission tool. So this might be the best case for those who like to constantly tweak and reconfigure their PC. And at $169 USD (159 dollars in the majority of other countries), it looks reasonable, but there is a decent amount of color on the back. You must be aware that that white model will sell for additional $10. Most of the upgraded kits are well priced, with all but the GPU mounting kits running for under twenty dollars. But you’re going to have to play with all your cooling considerations into the price because the O11D EVO doesn’t carry any fans. As long as it supports up to 10 spinners, none must be put on front unless you buy front-facing mesh kit.\nSpecifications TypeMid-Tower / Micro-Dimension Support, – Integrated Speak, – Fx, USB, – XT, E-To-X, -Dimension Support, -Synthese /Senior Drive, -Menid-Tower / Micro-Timens, -Mom.synthodes, -Mom /Senior/MonstyR\nLian Li O11D Design: With its mixture of glass, aluminum and steel (and most importantly steel), the O11D EVO feels like most other O11 chassis, which is, to say, good, but not super high. The company moved into new pin-mounting for the pop-off panels, as in the first half of 2014, the Ssupd Meshlicious and Hyte Revolt 3. That means the front and side panels stand up without tools or removing the first panel. And they usually stay around when you want them. The two glass panels have screws that hold their hands more tightly than a hand. I’d suggest that you remove all the panels on your build, but the side panels can be loose when you flip around. You loosen two holls at the back, but the top panel will be flat again on quite a very difficult note. The case is nearly infinitely reconfigurable inside. There are over a dozen panels, pieces and ports that can be moved or removed to suit your needs, and some don’t even require a screwdriver. Most require removing a couple of screws, but you’ll likely not want to swap out these parts with one of the five optional kits. That’s not to say that this case could not be transformed without the help of extra parts. You can invert the layout of the case so the motherboard can be installed both side of the case. There are about a dozen steps involving the removal of several of the case’s interior parts. Because of time constraints, we didn’t install such a system, but here we can learn how to build up a case for these types of problems. This is important because some of the above kits will not work in this orientation. The other thing to rearrange in the O11D EVO out of the box is the front IO, which is standardly backed up by the front. If you don’t like having two USB-A, one USB-C and one major combo, the good news is, you can pop up the port housing from the tabs that hold it on the bottom of the case and move it either to the left side near the back or right side near the front. The port housing doesn’t allow the underboard to get into and out of the holes. When it’s a nice design touch that acknowledges the size of the O11D EVO, Lian Li designed the power button so that it wraps around the right side of the case, which means you can press it either from the front or from the side. In general, when it comes to how tall and wide, those who are not that large or tall as many people as you have it, are likely to plop that big boy from the floor. However, the position of the bottom-mounted ports makes them pretty uncomfortable no matter where you put them.\nLian Li O11D EVO Accessory Kits. Consider the top I/O kit a few of the five kits for this case. As far as your name goes, you can attach the front-mounted IO to the top of the case. This is also the cheapest O11D kit, priced at ninety-two dollars. It’s cheap because of a strip of aluminium whose holes are cut out for ports and a few screws. For this, try to get over the tether. The screws off the bottom, the cables to the top and the aluminum strip stripped. Next, screw the headless space beneath the strip, then put the new top strip – with ports in place, on top of the case and screw it down with a captive thumb screw at the back. If you want more external ports than this, there’s an Additional I/O kit, which can install at any of the three above mentioned places in the upper left. It has two additional USB-A ports and a USB-C port. Just note that you will need a lot of front-panel connectors/headers to use standard and additional IO kit, both as these two use one USB 3.0 header and one USB 3.1 front-panel connector. As said by the upper end, the O11D EVO consists of a single head. When able to pull air from the bottom, it exhausts your air either above or back as a fan. If you do want to install fan kits, there’s also a kit for it. The Front Mesh Kit ($9.99) replaces the front glass panel with a rigidly framed piece of metal mesh. There are two metal rails that are attached to the mesh, allowing you to install three 120 mm fans or two 140 mm air movers, the same as the brackets that are on the bottom and the top of the case. If you have a 120mm spinner at the back, that’s 10 total fans that the case supports and quite an additional expense, as an extra expense, you can’t carry any over from previous build. The O11D EVO looks very good with the trio of Corsair ML 120 fans in the front, along with the top I/O and the Front Mesh Kit. It should’ve a high airflow because a panta is for sale. But this setup is not the same as the basis of the case. The other two kits for the O11D EVO do involve alternate graphics card orientations. They’re quite expensive but they are also both with a power socket. This is the Vertical GPU Kit, which is $69.99. Aside from the cable, you can mount the graphics card on one hand, standing up from the back of the case, going towards the back of the case. Before installing the kit, you must take care of most of the case’s eight expansion slot covers. This is what will help you take the second through the fifth slot covers, and then the part left of the bracket in the above picture is placed into the same holes that most often hold the expansion slot covers. On note, though, that the combination of an air cooler (a be quiet! The simple one that is contained in this kit is the large graphics card (Zotac’s RTX 2080 Amp Extreme) and it has ample weight for clearance issues. As a result, the cooling solution wasn’t flexible enough to make the GPU drop down a second slot, so I could drank the water bottle or iced the compressor for the second bit. While the cooler was low, I thought was just enough that I would turn a bit more time into a whole room. Of course, this won’t really be an issue if you use an electrical controller mounted on the upper ground. Even though fans are installed in the front, the bracket is built to accommodate triple-width graphics cards, and there’s a 16-inch-ft-long area of clearance for a GPU. However, this kit doesn’t have any issues with the GPU clearance if you don’t have one of the biggest graphics cards ever built. It is the actual GB Kit ($89), which is the most expensive and a little more complex to install. It makes it easy for you to attach your graphics card to the front of the case, running from the right to the right, between the mains of the motherboard and the mains of the case. It comes with a faster, more portable cable, a hook to hang the GPU’s PCIe slot anchors, and a adjustable grip to stabilize the bottom of the card. Installing this card also removes the standard fan-mounting bracket that ships pre-installed in the front of the motherboard. In its place, there is a sturdy-metal bracket that comes in the case’s accessory box. This last bit is dead simple, because it’s held in place by a spring-residable lever with which we can use the computer. As with most of the kits, you’d need to remove the front, top, and both sides before you’d like to install. This will allow the best access to every mounting hole, wiring-routing grommet and any open space you will need to move through from bulky wires and components. Next, since you’ve replaced the wall bracket with the solid metal panel, you will need to attach the large bracket (top center of the image above) to the top of the case with four screws. Next, you’ll need to install the adjustable frame mount (bottom left left in the image above) to the back metal bracket. Let’s slide the graphics card into the headrest, hang it with some screws and adjust the bottom bracket (image below) to give you a second piece of time to hold your particular graphics card in place at both front and rear. Next you’ll have to install the PCIe cable in the slot on your motherboard and add the other end to your GPU. To prevent the large riser cables from covering your cooler or cooler with air, you can use the cable ties that provided for you to hold the PCIe cables together. The end result looks pretty slick if you have an RGB-equipped GPU. But as you might know, putting your GPU in the front of the case means that you must have internal access to the case, so that you can get in touch with your video cable and then they should be sorted in the back of the case. While the O11D is very large, it isn’t a big issue. And Lian Li provides a large grommeted hole at the rear, just over the default address of the driver’s case, for that kind of setup. This isn’t the most convenient, especially if you swap or add video cable. If you want to show off your GPU and its RGB lights, it might be the ultimate way to do so. Or you could save up to 10 dollars, use the existing vertical-set instead of the upright-option, and still have your GPU connectivity as part of the rear IO, as said by the computer gods. If you don’t notice, the O11D EVO really revolves around giving you options.\nThe rest of the building process has been under the pressure of anyone. After plowing through the five-way kit, most of them with the motherboard and an air cooler already installed, the rest of the build process in the O11D EVO was easy. That was partly due to the fact that the chassis is too huge and you can remove the four side panels in half an hour. Three fenders come out and the top drops out after the two thumb screws are drained. Then you’re just installing parts and routing cables around the large open space. Lian Li provides a vertical chamber with three pre-installed velcro straps for the cable loop. And atop the sturdy bracket which’s useful for two or three feet drive is and provides an escape from much of your cable mess after it’s installed. It goes out of the case in an accessible way. It comes with tabs slotting into holes and the bottom and a few captive thumb screws holding it in place. You can mount the power supply at the bottom (default) or switch its place between the two-speed aqueous cage at the top. And if the two 3.5-inch bays and two 2.5-inch mounts aren’t enough for the storage needs, there are plenty of options. You can add several included bars to the fan-mounting bracket of the case to install four more 2,5-inch drives or two more 3,5-inch platter spinners. The built-in metal bracket for the Upright GPU is fitted with mounting holes for four additional 2.5-inch drives or two more three inchers. Because of all this and the countless M.2 slots have been added to your motherboard, the majority of users must have enjoyed the storage here. Should you remove the main drive cage, you can get two power supplies in the car, one over the other, the company even includes a foam towel to help keep them separated. This case is exactly what you are, and with so much space, the options begin to get endless,especially as soon as you consider the five optional accessory kits. But that’s also means you’ll need to be good about keeping extra parts and instructions if you wish to change things up months or years. End, I went with the Upright GPU kit, partly because it’s the last one that I installed, as well as the front Mesh kit, because I wanted fans to take care of the front and back of the screen. I opted for the top I/O kit, because despite the huge case and 55-inch LG LCD telescopic monitor, my desk has no room. I took a few seats with the Ryzen 7 3700, the X570 Aorus Master and two sticks of HyperX Fury RAM. The con – semi-modular power and four 120 mm VCR fans (that are RGB, but I wasn’t interested in connecting cables and a hub, so I just plug-in the fan themselves for airflow). I could’ve easily installed more drives than the still-chugging Samsung 960 Pro M.2 boot SSD. However, when the case’s launch was too late for the end of the accident, I stuck with the previously mentioned parts, tidied up the wires, slapped the four side panels back on. This is a complete review without a cooling and acoustic numbers. But given that the case is with no fans, and the front panel can be either glass or mesh with an optional kit, performance is what you can do. In spite of the fact that the wide internal layout and mesh made up around 2/3 of the right side panel (or the left), as well as vents on most of the top, airflow shouldn’t be an issue unless you do something dumb like stick with the front glass panel and put all your fans directly behind it, where they can’t pull in fresh air.\nBottom Line Perhaps more than any of these and any of my experiences, when I were working to, or wrote about in the last ten years, the O11D EVO can be transformed into a design or redesigned to suit you. You know that no matter how you use it, the O11D EVO will take up a lot of space, either on your very roomy desk or on the floor. Because the $34-plus relic for the black model costs $169 and then becomes much more expensive once you add in a bit of more airflow and a more attractive GPU, the real complaint is that this ‘Top I/O’ kit does not currently ship with the case in a single casing. On smaller cases that are clearly designed for your desk, an under-teaching port can be easily found. The mysterious situation is over 18 inches deep and a foot wide, but it’s quite certainly not destined for a spot on the floor. And nobody wants to turn on a rug to buy a headset or a USB cable.\n","wordCount":"2753","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-02T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Frances Stults"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/lian-li-s-o11d-evo-is-a-morphing-case-monster/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Lian Li S O11D Evo Is A Morphing Case Monster</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 2, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2753 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Frances Stults</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#specifications>Specifications</a></li><li><a href=#lian-li-o11d-design>Lian Li O11D Design:</a></li><li><a href=#lian-li-o11d-evo-accessory-kits>Lian Li O11D EVO Accessory Kits.</a></li><li><a href=#the-rest-of-the-building-process-has-been-under-the-pressure-of-anyone>The rest of the building process has been under the pressure of anyone.</a></li><li><a href=#bottom-line>Bottom Line</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Unfortunately, the iceberg is now turning and iceberg.

It has two additional USB-A ports and a USB-C port. Just note that you will need a lot of front-panel connectors/headers to use standard and additional IO kit, both as these two use one USB 3.0 header and one USB 3.1 front-panel connector.
As said by the upper end, the O11D EVO consists of a single head. When able to pull air from the bottom, it exhausts your air either above or back as a fan. If you do want to install fan kits, there’s also a kit for it. The Front Mesh Kit ($9.99) replaces the front glass panel with a rigidly framed piece of metal mesh. There are two metal rails that are attached to the mesh, allowing you to install three 120 mm fans or two 140 mm air movers, the same as the brackets that are on the bottom and the top of the case. If you have a 120mm spinner at the back, that’s 10 total fans that the case supports and quite an additional expense, as an extra expense, you can’t carry any over from previous build.
The O11D EVO looks very good with the trio of Corsair ML 120 fans in the front, along with the top I/O and the Front Mesh Kit. It should’ve a high airflow because a panta is for sale. But this setup is not the same as the basis of the case.
The other two kits for the O11D EVO do involve alternate graphics card orientations. They’re quite expensive but they are also both with a power socket.
This is the Vertical GPU Kit, which is $69.99. Aside from the cable, you can mount the graphics card on one hand, standing up from the back of the case, going towards the back of the case. Before installing the kit, you must take care of most of the case’s eight expansion slot covers. This is what will help you take the second through the fifth slot covers, and then the part left of the bracket in the above picture is placed into the same holes that most often hold the expansion slot covers.
On note, though, that the combination of an air cooler (a be quiet! The simple one that is contained in this kit is the large graphics card (Zotac’s RTX 2080 Amp Extreme) and it has ample weight for clearance issues. As a result, the cooling solution wasn’t flexible enough to make the GPU drop down a second slot, so I could drank the water bottle or iced the compressor for the second bit. While the cooler was low, I thought was just enough that I would turn a bit more time into a whole room. Of course, this won’t really be an issue if you use an electrical controller mounted on the upper ground.
Even though fans are installed in the front, the bracket is built to accommodate triple-width graphics cards, and there’s a 16-inch-ft-long area of clearance for a GPU. However, this kit doesn’t have any issues with the GPU clearance if you don’t have one of the biggest graphics cards ever built.
It is the actual GB Kit ($89), which is the most expensive and a little more complex to install. It makes it easy for you to attach your graphics card to the front of the case, running from the right to the right, between the mains of the motherboard and the mains of the case. It comes with a faster, more portable cable, a hook to hang the GPU’s PCIe slot anchors, and a adjustable grip to stabilize the bottom of the card.
Installing this card also removes the standard fan-mounting bracket that ships pre-installed in the front of the motherboard. In its place, there is a sturdy-metal bracket that comes in the case’s accessory box. This last bit is dead simple, because it’s held in place by a spring-residable lever with which we can use the computer. As with most of the kits, you’d need to remove the front, top, and both sides before you’d like to install. This will allow the best access to every mounting hole, wiring-routing grommet and any open space you will need to move through from bulky wires and components.
Next, since you’ve replaced the wall bracket with the solid metal panel, you will need to attach the large bracket (top center of the image above) to the top of the case with four screws. Next, you’ll need to install the adjustable frame mount (bottom left left in the image above) to the back metal bracket. Let’s slide the graphics card into the headrest, hang it with some screws and adjust the bottom bracket (image below) to give you a second piece of time to hold your particular graphics card in place at both front and rear.
Next you’ll have to install the PCIe cable in the slot on your motherboard and add the other end to your GPU. To prevent the large riser cables from covering your cooler or cooler with air, you can use the cable ties that provided for you to hold the PCIe cables together.
The end result looks pretty slick if you have an RGB-equipped GPU. But as you might know, putting your GPU in the front of the case means that you must have internal access to the case, so that you can get in touch with your video cable and then they should be sorted in the back of the case. While the O11D is very large, it isn’t a big issue. And Lian Li provides a large grommeted hole at the rear, just over the default address of the driver’s case, for that kind of setup.
This isn’t the most convenient, especially if you swap or add video cable. If you want to show off your GPU and its RGB lights, it might be the ultimate way to do so. Or you could save up to 10 dollars, use the existing vertical-set instead of the upright-option, and still have your GPU connectivity as part of the rear IO, as said by the computer gods. If you don’t notice, the O11D EVO really revolves around giving you options.</p><h2 id=the-rest-of-the-building-process-has-been-under-the-pressure-of-anyone>The rest of the building process has been under the pressure of anyone.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-rest-of-the-building-process-has-been-under-the-pressure-of-anyone>#</a></h2><p>After plowing through the five-way kit, most of them with the motherboard and an air cooler already installed, the rest of the build process in the O11D EVO was easy. That was partly due to the fact that the chassis is too huge and you can remove the four side panels in half an hour. Three fenders come out and the top drops out after the two thumb screws are drained. Then you’re just installing parts and routing cables around the large open space.
Lian Li provides a vertical chamber with three pre-installed velcro straps for the cable loop. And atop the sturdy bracket which’s useful for two or three feet drive is and provides an escape from much of your cable mess after it’s installed. It goes out of the case in an accessible way. It comes with tabs slotting into holes and the bottom and a few captive thumb screws holding it in place.
You can mount the power supply at the bottom (default) or switch its place between the two-speed aqueous cage at the top. And if the two 3.5-inch bays and two 2.5-inch mounts aren’t enough for the storage needs, there are plenty of options. You can add several included bars to the fan-mounting bracket of the case to install four more 2,5-inch drives or two more 3,5-inch platter spinners. The built-in metal bracket for the Upright GPU is fitted with mounting holes for four additional 2.5-inch drives or two more three inchers. Because of all this and the countless M.2 slots have been added to your motherboard, the majority of users must have enjoyed the storage here.
Should you remove the main drive cage, you can get two power supplies in the car, one over the other, the company even includes a foam towel to help keep them separated. This case is exactly what you are, and with so much space, the options begin to get endless,especially as soon as you consider the five optional accessory kits. But that’s also means you’ll need to be good about keeping extra parts and instructions if you wish to change things up months or years.
End, I went with the Upright GPU kit, partly because it’s the last one that I installed, as well as the front Mesh kit, because I wanted fans to take care of the front and back of the screen. I opted for the top I/O kit, because despite the huge case and 55-inch LG LCD telescopic monitor, my desk has no room. I took a few seats with the Ryzen 7 3700, the X570 Aorus Master and two sticks of HyperX Fury RAM. The con – semi-modular power and four 120 mm VCR fans (that are RGB, but I wasn’t interested in connecting cables and a hub, so I just plug-in the fan themselves for airflow). I could’ve easily installed more drives than the still-chugging Samsung 960 Pro M.2 boot SSD. However, when the case’s launch was too late for the end of the accident, I stuck with the previously mentioned parts, tidied up the wires, slapped the four side panels back on.
This is a complete review without a cooling and acoustic numbers. But given that the case is with no fans, and the front panel can be either glass or mesh with an optional kit, performance is what you can do. In spite of the fact that the wide internal layout and mesh made up around 2/3 of the right side panel (or the left), as well as vents on most of the top, airflow shouldn’t be an issue unless you do something dumb like stick with the front glass panel and put all your fans directly behind it, where they can’t pull in fresh air.</p><h2 id=bottom-line>Bottom Line<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#bottom-line>#</a></h2><p>Perhaps more than any of these and any of my experiences, when I were working to, or wrote about in the last ten years, the O11D EVO can be transformed into a design or redesigned to suit you. You know that no matter how you use it, the O11D EVO will take up a lot of space, either on your very roomy desk or on the floor. Because the $34-plus relic for the black model costs $169 and then becomes much more expensive once you add in a bit of more airflow and a more attractive GPU, the real complaint is that this ‘Top I/O’ kit does not currently ship with the case in a single casing. On smaller cases that are clearly designed for your desk, an under-teaching port can be easily found. The mysterious situation is over 18 inches deep and a foot wide, but it’s quite certainly not destined for a spot on the floor. And nobody wants to turn on a rug to buy a headset or a USB cable.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/lenovo-turns-the-ghost-on-reveals-amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Lenovo Turns The Ghost On Reveals Amd Radeon Rx 6500 Xt</span></a>
