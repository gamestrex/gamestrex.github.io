The event was made available twice in 2017 - first between January 23rd and February 20th, then returning July 31st until September as part of the Magitek Exosuit and Cross Chain update, where it has since disappeared from the game’s menu. During the active period, you can access this special carnival version of Altissia provided you’ve downloaded the Holiday Pack (and if you have the game’s Season Pass, the Holiday Pack+ as well) from PSN or Xbox Live. Next, select Special from the game’s main menu, where you can select a game save. Select your latest save, and remember to save any progress during the Carnival over this same save. It won’t over write your current story progress in the main game, but simply allows you to continue where you left off in the Carnival, carrying any items over in the process. If you’re simply after some quick medallions, we’d avoid the mini-games (which are tough to master) and simply explore the city, grabbing Medallions from the streets, as well as by solving quick puzzles and hunting down hidden items, guides for which are discussed and linked to below. Interrupted by Fireworks This essentially acts as the ‘main objective’ - getting enough Choco-Mog Medallions (50 in total) to purchase entry to seats for a fireworks show and a luxury suit at the Leville. Medallions come a variety of sources, which we’ll explain below, and how you get them is up to you. When you have enough, purchase the entry from the Prize Counter then head to the Leville, and enjoy the show. When the cutscene ends, you’ll receive the ‘Dream Egg’ item, which has the description: “Obtained at the Moogle Chocobo Carnival, this enigmatic egg is full of big dreams, but shows no signs of hatching any time soon.” As it suggests, there is no use for it yet, but it’s worth unlocking now as it could be for something very useful in a future game update. Chocobo and Moogle hunts There are a variety of fetch quests dotted all around the Festival, giving you Medallions as a reward. They include Oedka ke Chocochicks - which has you hunt down 15 Chocobo chicks that have escaped across the city, which are listed in our Oedka ke Chocochicks locations page - and The Brothers Kupomazov, which have you photograph six hidden Moogle plushes throughout the city, again fully explained in our The Brothers Kupomazov locations page. If you’re purely after medals, then the Brothers quest is the most lucrative out of the two. There is also a series of Photo Challenges; these are teased on placards throughout the city, tasking you with finding certain scenes or individuals and taking pictures of them for two medals each. Moogle Quiz and Decoration Puzzles There are two types of brain teasers in the Festival. One is All About Moogles, where you answer quiz questions about Moogles and the wider world of Lucis, which we give explain how to win in our All About Moogles answers page. There’s also three Decorations: Decoded puzzles in Listro Park - again, solved in full in that prior link - which have you place decorations in a specific order based on a series of riddles. Both of these are quick and easy sources of medals - especially if you use a guide - so make them a port of call during your stay. New Chocobo Racing courses One of the more fleshed out activities from the main story, Chocobo Racing, carries over into Carnival, with two new courses in the game’s port area. Completing each one under the time limit will earn you medals, and net an “impressive” par time for exclusive items. Read how to earn them in our dedicated Seaside Scamper and Water Trotter Chocobo Racing courses page. If you’ve unlocked the Ascension ability nodes for them, you’ll also earn AP points and EXP for completing races, too. Fishing Another mini-game from the story, and Noct’s specialism, is fishing. There are three fishing spots dotted around the city, and offer a range of exclusive rewards, including some Medallions for certain grades of fish:\nA Class - Howling Gust rod B Class - Albireo reel C Class - Poppeck: Tinselred Chococo lure D Class - Mog Rank: Rubygold Moogle lure E Class - Choco-mog Medallions\nLike Chocobo Racing, you can earn AP points and EXP - as well as Fishing experience - if you’ve unlocked the relevant Fishing nodes in the Ascension menu. Galviano Gallery mini-game This mini-game is in Arena Galviano Station, which you can access from the gondola in the far north of the city, in Listro Park. This is a simple shooting gallery, hitting targets that pop up for points. The main targets and their scores are:\nWhite - Low resistance (100 points) Orange - High resistance (200 points) Bright yellow - Low resistance, disappears fast (500 points) Blue targets - High resistance (1,000 points) Cactuar - High resistance (1,500 points) Behemoth - High resistance, (3,000 points)\nThe key thing is to avoid overheating, which happens when you hold down the trigger for too long, knocking you out for an excruciating long amount of time, and will almost certainly mean you won’t beat the target time. You want to look out for Cactuar’s at all times - since they are high value and easy to take down - and obviously the huge targets. Don’t be afraid to spray an entire line of whites in one go, either. The higher the difficulty, the more medals you earn, with 10 for succeeding on Hard. Whack-a-Cactuar mini-game This is also in Arena Galviano Station, which you can access from the gondola in the far north of the city, in Listro Park. There’s three difficulty levels, each increasing the score and adding adversaries you have to avoid as you attempt to run around and hit Cacutars. While it’s best to avoid warp strikes as that’ll give you lower points, it’s the best way to get close to an enemy, so feel free to use it to avoid wasting time. However if you’re close by, you might be better running the short distance swinging, as warps strikes also have a tendency to overshoot. When the Giant Cacutar shows, go after that specifically, as that what gets you more points. The higher the difficulty, the more medals you earn, with 10 for succeeding on Hard. Waiting for Maagho mini-game You’ll find this in the ‘Floating Market Station - Maagho’, which can be reached only by gondola. Board any of the yellow circuit stations in the main part of the city and choose it from the menu. This is a mini-game where you have to take orders from one or more customers, remembering their orders, and serving them out again. First, take the orders from the customers; there are only four dishes, so it’s easiest to remember their position on the grid than their names (the number of dishes is important, too) as well as who ordered them. If you don’t advance to the dish serving stage, then someone else needs an order, so keep looking round When you have taken everyone’s order, you’ll then have to serve them up. Give them to the correct people, and repeat. Complete the quotas given to you to get medallions. Other Carnival activities for easy Medallions As well as proper fully fledged mini-games, there are other things to check out which will award you with a handful of Medallions. Children the city will have lost their balloons, and you must Warp Strike before they float away. While you have to be quick off the mark, the camera will point you in their direction, so it’s fairly simple to get them. Three we’ve found is on a bridge north of Port Station, another on a bridge north east of the Sonelio Plaza fishing spot, and one on the south side of Listro Park. You’ll get two Medallions per successful balloon retrieval. Elsewhere, get your photo taken at the tourist spot on the upper level west of the Gurgola Canal fishing spot for three easy coins, and participate in a dancing mini-game with costumed characters (one opposite the Chocobo Races in the south west, and one opposite the Square Enix Cafe to the east) for another three easy Medallions each. Medallions dropped around the city As well as earning them from side-quests and mini-games, Medallions can be found on the ground throughout the city as you explore, similar to the twinkling items and features you’ll find in the main story. The number of Medallions you collect from each location is randomised and on the low side (between one and three) but it’s one of the easiest sources that quickly adds up, so keep an eye out for any nearby. While this isn’t a definitive list of every location, it should highlight some of the more obvious ones to find:\nBehind where you begin at Port Station Along the docks on the west side; go up the bridge north of the Chocobo Races kiosk, head south to fountain in the wall Inside the Leville, on the table opposite the check-in desk South of the Port West Station and underneath the Chocochicks quest giver South of the Ministerial Quarter Station, past the bridge On the upper level between the Ministerial Quarter Station and Furgola Canal fishing spot, on a table Round the corner from the Photo Challenge board on the upper level next to the Furgola Canal on the map Behind the tourist photo board in the north of the city, past the dancing Kenny Crow Head south east of the dancing Kenny Crow in the north of the city, and it’s in the open alley On a bench in the north west passage, west and up some stairs where you find Kenny Crow East of Listro Park, down the small set of steps, by the chairs Behind the Square Enix Cafe desk The level below the Square Enix Cafe is an alley where you’d find the Cursed Canvas quest South of where the wedding dress shop would be, on a cafe table Just outside Palsino Street Station\nNeed more help? Our Final Fantasy 15 guide and walkthrough can provide tips on the open-world’s many quests and activities. Learning how to get AP fast, EXP fast and Gil fast in Final Fantasy 15 will aid you in the many optional dungeons and tombs - including how to open and explore their locked doors. And if you want to get around easier, you can rent a Chocobo, learn the infinite sprint trick and later in the game, get the flying car Regalia Type F. There’s also more to see and do with DLC, such as with Episode Gladiolus, Episode Prompto and multiplayer Comrades packs.\n","wordCount":"1845","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jennifer Brunswick"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/final-fantasy-15-moogle-chocobo-carnival-guide-medal-locations-how-to-access-quests-and-mini-games-explained/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Final Fantasy 15 Moogle Chocobo Carnival Guide Medal Locations How To Access Quests And Mini Games Explained</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 1, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1845 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jennifer Brunswick</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>As silly as it is, there&rsquo;s plenty of things to see, do and take into your full game once you&rsquo;re done with it.

While this isn&rsquo;t a definitive list of every location, it should highlight some of the more obvious ones to find:</p><p>Behind where you begin at Port Station Along the docks on the west side; go up the bridge north of the Chocobo Races kiosk, head south to fountain in the wall Inside the Leville, on the table opposite the check-in desk South of the Port West Station and underneath the Chocochicks quest giver South of the Ministerial Quarter Station, past the bridge On the upper level between the Ministerial Quarter Station and Furgola Canal fishing spot, on a table Round the corner from the Photo Challenge board on the upper level next to the Furgola Canal on the map Behind the tourist photo board in the north of the city, past the dancing Kenny Crow Head south east of the dancing Kenny Crow in the north of the city, and it&rsquo;s in the open alley On a bench in the north west passage, west and up some stairs where you find Kenny Crow East of Listro Park, down the small set of steps, by the chairs Behind the Square Enix Cafe desk The level below the Square Enix Cafe is an alley where you&rsquo;d find the Cursed Canvas quest South of where the wedding dress shop would be, on a cafe table Just outside Palsino Street Station</p><p>Need more help? Our Final Fantasy 15 guide and walkthrough can provide tips on the open-world&rsquo;s many quests and activities. Learning how to get AP fast, EXP fast and Gil fast in Final Fantasy 15 will aid you in the many optional dungeons and tombs - including how to open and explore their locked doors. And if you want to get around easier, you can rent a Chocobo, learn the infinite sprint trick and later in the game, get the flying car Regalia Type F. There&rsquo;s also more to see and do with DLC, such as with Episode Gladiolus, Episode Prompto and multiplayer Comrades packs.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/final-fantasy-15-moogle-chocobo-carnival-guide-quests-medals-mini-games-4820-148545533118.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/final-fantasy-15-moogle-chocobo-carnival-guide-quests-medals-mini-games-4820-148545533118.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Final Fantasy 15 Moogle Chocobo Carnival guide   Medal locations  how to access  quests and mini games explained -
