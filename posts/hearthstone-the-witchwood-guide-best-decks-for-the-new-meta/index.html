We’re going to keep updating these articles over the weekend and will have another update for you shortly. Each of the game’s nine heroes are getting their own exclusive cards as always, with the remainder distributed into the Neutral pool of cards. Each hero is also getting two Legendary cards to play around with - the standard distribution these days. Perhaps most interesting of all is the Shaman’s new Legendary, Hagatha the Witch. This is the first hero card to be released since last summer’s Knights of the Frozen Throne expansion, and only the Shaman gets a piece of the action this time around. When played for eight Mana, Hagatha deals three damage to every active minion (including your own), and gives your hero five points of Armour. You also get a new passive Hero Power called Bewitch, which adds a random Shaman spell to your hand whenever you play a minion.

If you’re struggling to keep up with the cost of the game, have a look through the site’s round-up of budget Witchwood decks - there’s something to suit every pocket there. Rush is a lot like Charge, except minions with the Rush ability can only attack enemy minions on the turn they’re played. They can’t actually hit the other player straight away, which tames their power level somewhat. Echo cards can be played over and over again on the same turn, as long as you have the Mana necessary to keep casting it. It remains to be seen how popular these cards prove - they’ve had a bit of a lukewarm reception overall so far. The first of these - Baku the Mooneater - upgrades your Hero Power if your deck only contains odd-cost cards. The second - Genn Greymane - reduces the cost of your Hero Power to one Mana if you only have even-cost cards in your deck. There are going to be a lot of very interesting experiments with these two characters at the start of The Witchwood meta and beyond. To see what kind of limitations they’ll place on deck building at launch, Metabomb is in the process of putting together overviews of excluded cards for each hero, in each case: This kind of content is coming back with The Witchwood, and will do so in the form of Monster Hunt. In this new adventure you’ll first pick one of four unique explorers, then head into the woods to deal with a series of monsters, expanding and improving your deck as you go. Metabomb also has a Monster Hunt guide if you’d like to start brushing up on the finer detail of what’s involved with this side of the expansion.\n","wordCount":"790","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-03T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-03T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Christopher Foley"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/hearthstone-the-witchwood-guide-best-decks-for-the-new-meta/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Hearthstone The Witchwood Guide Best Decks For The New Meta</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-03 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 3, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;790 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Christopher Foley</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>In our Witchwood guide you&rsquo;ll find an overview of every aspect of the new expansion, from the cards themselves to the evolution of the single-player content that first made its debut in last year&rsquo;s Kobolds and Catacombs expansion.
