Underneath it, you can see the number of spins available, and with each spin, the number declines. Finally, when you are out of the number, you have to wait for a little for the new batch of spins to generate. The slot machine has 4 reels with different symbols and if you get lucky to score the same symbols on all the reels in a row you’ve performed the action.\nThese four symbols are: 1. Bag of coins Unlike the other symbols, you don’t require a whole row of them to earn a prize. Each coin bag you score after a spin gets you to get a little reward, however, getting a whole row of them gives a bigger payoff than four individual coin bags would have.\n2. The hammer – to attack Have a full row of hammers and you’re ready to hit another player’s base. If you’ve connected your Facebook account to the Coin Master, you can select a player to target, or the game would choose a random player. Bashing the building earns you a coin incentive and lessens the star rating of the building you attacked.\n3. The pig bandit – raid The pig bandit is a representation of a smiling pig wearing a bandit mask. If you get all four in a row, you’ll execute a raid right away. Over the slots machine is the name and image of your Moin Master, a player who is your appointed raid target. When the raid starts, you’re escorted to the Coin Master’s village. Nevertheless, instead of destroying one of their buildings, you’re given three shovels to dig a hole. There are a variety of places in the village that you can unearth (marked by wide x’s). Select three holes to dig up, many of which will hold a large amount of coin which are obtained straight away from the victim’s old stash.\n4. The shield – defend The shield is used to defend your base from enemy attacks you will get up to three shields in one go, which ensures you’re safe from three attacks. If you have a shield when an opponent hits one of your buildings, your house will be guarded and your star rating won’t decline. The very same rules apply when you strike a player having shields. However, shields don’t protect you from the raids. Also Read | Fallout 76 Nuke Codes Guide\nBetting If you have accrued a sufficient number of spins, you can place bets. When you raise your bet, every slot machine spins numerous spins, but you also boost your odds of winning huge spins. Bets multiply the prizes you get from the slot machine spins.\nVillage building Villages are regarded as “levels” in the Coin Master. There are five buildings that you have to create on each level. To complete and proceed to the next village, you must update all the buildings in your existing village to a 5-star rating. Updating the building requires coins, and upgrades get steadily more costly the more you get through the game. For now, there are 293 villages, each with a distinct theme to accomplish in Coin Master.\nRevenge The revenge feature helps you to get back to a player who has destroyed your village. If another player has strongly hit your base, you have a chance to get a strike back Just give a spin to the slots machine. If you get a complete row of hammers, the game will move you to the attack screen and the random village transition. Pay close attention to the top of your screen there will be a revenge button. Select it and the game will list all the players who have recently targeted you. Choose one, and you’ll be carried to the village you want to destroy.\nCards Cards are bagged by unlocking chests that are bought by coins. There are a variety of themed card sets, and each set includes nine cards. Grab all the nine in the set, and you will be awarded prizes, like free spins, massive coin inflows, and even pets. There are 3 types of chests that you can buy; the costlier the chest, the more cards you’ll find inside. When you advanced to the higher levels of the village, you will get the opportunity to earn exclusive gold cards from the chests you open. Gold cards are essentially rarer variants of other cards, and their sets provide far higher prizes upon accomplishment. Among the most thrilling concepts in coin, the master is the card trading system. You can offer up to five cards to your friends daily, so it’s a smart idea to join the coin master forums and communities. Many of them have designated card trading sections where you can enter into trading agreements with other coin master players.\nChests You can buy these using in-game coins and all the chests can grant you up to 5-star quality cards. However, as mentioned before he is costlier than the chest, you’ll have a greater chance of bagging high-quality cards and vice-versa. You can also get pet treats, pet XP, or chest bonus spins which are added to the inventory on top of the cards you get and don’t influence the card drop chances.\nCard Drop Odds By Chest Solely based on the chest you open up, you have a good chance of winning a unique rareness of the card. Just the mystery, ruby, and valentine’s chests are expected to drop the joker card the rest of them don’t. Wooden, golden \u0026 magical chests are readily accessible after completing the village 2. The small lucky chest is available at village 4, small easter chest at village 10, big easter chest and emerald chest at village 20, valentine’s chest and big lucky chest at village 30, Viking chest and Saphir chest at village 70, fortune chest at village 100, ruby chest at village 110 and finally epic chest at village 130. Also Read | CR7 Free Fire Guide These are the official probabilities according to moon active, the developer behind Coin Master: Pet Snack Drops Just mystery chests and valentine’s chests are allowed to drop pet snacks.\nBonus Spins And Pet XP Emerald, sapphire, and ruby chest have defied odds for bonus spins. Bonus spin odds for mystery, valentine’s, small lucky, big lucky, small easter, and big easter chests rely on the current village level. Pet XP also functions the very same way; the higher your village level, the more possible pet XP you can get from the chest.

The joker card has the potential to turn to any card you desire, including gold cards. Please remember that joker cards have a deadline, so make sure to use them before they expire.\nPets Pets are unveiled by navigating the pet screen from the game menu or by clicking the egg under the slots machine. Once triggered, your pet can offer you a bonus for the next four hours. When these four hours are over, your pet will fall asleep and you won’t be willing to enjoy their benefits for a considerable amount of time. You may accelerate their healing by providing them with treats. You can pay actual cash to get food right away or take a spin on the slots machine for a shot to get treats. Treats are offered in addition to the usual compensation you get from your spin result. The benefits given to pets can be improved by offering them XP potions that boost them up.

Rhino Rhino can be activated by clearing the creature’s card collection. When it’s active, the rhino has a chance to block enemy strikes, just as a shield does. Leveling up a rhino with XP potions improves the likelihood that rhino can effectively fight off a hostile attack at its general level, rhino has a 10% chance of avoiding an enemy attack.\n3. Foxy Foxy is the very first pet you unleash when you play Coin Master, but it’s also the most important one further in the game. Foxy provides an extra hammer in raids that ensures you’ve got one more opportunity to find a coin or dig a chest. You can unlock foxy at level 4.\nTips and Tricks Don’t hoard your coins You are often vulnerable to possible raid stealing out a significant amount of your coin stash. So whenever possible you must spend them especially when you are short of shields or haven’t enabled the Rino pet yet. Holding a huge stash of coins also makes you a perfect target for big raids. A Big Raid is the highest possible bet Raid that, if effective, could end with the Raider stealing away zillions of your coins.\nBig Raids If you have a lot of spins at your fingertips, it can be enticing to want to increase your bet number and reap the compounded spin bonus. This is an entirely plausible way to make your Coin revenues quicker. However, it’s best to spare a really rich player from your spins for raiding. Just above the slots machine, you’ll see a Coin Master assigned to you along with their latest coin stores. Save loads of coins to bet for your Coin Master. As the volume of Coin, you gain from the Raid is proportional to the amount of Coin the player has on them, by only using Maximum Bets on very wealthy Coin Masters, you have a shot to earn a lot of Coins in a very brief period. If you plotting a big raid then leverage Foxy as an active pet as it provides you with another shovel to dig up thereby increasing your chance of getting shitloads of coins.\nPurchase Chests At Each Level While advancing next levels you must buy as many chests as possible since with each next level accessing lower level cards gets challenging. To complete your chest collection get the lower level cards in the beginning levels itself as there is nothing worse than giving up the valuable joker just to replace the missing common card that you could have obtained earlier in the game. Don’t Waste\nYour Pet’s Bonuses The enhanced effect of your pet will be activated just for 4 hours so if any chance you are not willing to play for the next 4 hours avoid activating them and use them to your maximum benefit when you can devote 4 hours following the pet’s activation. This also refers to the protective Rhino; when your foundation is under attack, it cannot actually withstand assaults until you bring it out explicitly to do so.\n1.

Underneath it, you can see the number of spins available, and with each spin, the number declines. Finally, when you are out of the number, you have to wait for a little for the new batch of spins to generate.
The slot machine has 4 reels with different symbols and if you get lucky to score the same symbols on all the reels in a row you’ve performed the action.</p><h3 id=these-four-symbols-are>These four symbols are:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#these-four-symbols-are>#</a></h3><h4 id=1-bag-of-coins>1. Bag of coins<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-bag-of-coins>#</a></h4><p>Unlike the other symbols, you don’t require a whole row of them to earn a prize. Each coin bag you score after a spin gets you to get a little reward, however, getting a whole row of them gives a bigger payoff than four individual coin bags would have.</p><h4 id=2-the-hammer--to-attack>2. The hammer – to attack<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-the-hammer--to-attack>#</a></h4><p>Have a full row of hammers and you’re ready to hit another player’s base. If you’ve connected your Facebook account to the Coin Master, you can select a player to target, or the game would choose a random player. Bashing the building earns you a coin incentive and lessens the star rating of the building you attacked.</p><h4 id=3-the-pig-bandit--raid>3. The pig bandit – raid<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-the-pig-bandit--raid>#</a></h4><p>The pig bandit is a representation of a smiling pig wearing a bandit mask. If you get all four in a row, you’ll execute a raid right away.
Over the slots machine is the name and image of your Moin Master, a player who is your appointed raid target. When the raid starts, you’re escorted to the Coin Master’s village. Nevertheless, instead of destroying one of their buildings, you’re given three shovels to dig a hole. There are a variety of places in the village that you can unearth (marked by wide x’s). Select three holes to dig up, many of which will hold a large amount of coin which are obtained straight away from the victim’s old stash.</p><h4 id=4-the-shield--defend>4. The shield – defend<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#4-the-shield--defend>#</a></h4><p>The shield is used to defend your base from enemy attacks you will get up to three shields in one go, which ensures you’re safe from three attacks. If you have a shield when an opponent hits one of your buildings, your house will be guarded and your star rating won’t decline. The very same rules apply when you strike a player having shields. However, shields don’t protect you from the raids.

When you raise your bet, every slot machine spins numerous spins, but you also boost your odds of winning huge spins. Bets multiply the prizes you get from the slot machine spins.</p><h3 id=village-building>Village building<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#village-building>#</a></h3><p>Villages are regarded as “levels” in the Coin Master. There are five buildings that you have to create on each level. To complete and proceed to the next village, you must update all the buildings in your existing village to a 5-star rating.
Updating the building requires coins, and upgrades get steadily more costly the more you get through the game.
For now, there are 293 villages, each with a distinct theme to accomplish in Coin Master.</p><h3 id=revenge>Revenge<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#revenge>#</a></h3><p>The revenge feature helps you to get back to a player who has destroyed your village. If another player has strongly hit your base, you have a chance to get a strike back
Just give a spin to the slots machine. If you get a complete row of hammers, the game will move you to the attack screen and the random village transition. Pay close attention to the top of your screen there will be a revenge button. Select it and the game will list all the players who have recently targeted you. Choose one, and you’ll be carried to the village you want to destroy.</p><h3 id=cards>Cards<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cards>#</a></h3><p>Cards are bagged by unlocking chests that are bought by coins. There are a variety of themed card sets, and each set includes nine cards. Grab all the nine in the set, and you will be awarded prizes, like free spins, massive coin inflows, and even pets.
There are 3 types of chests that you can buy; the costlier the chest, the more cards you’ll find inside. When you advanced to the higher levels of the village, you will get the opportunity to earn exclusive gold cards from the chests you open. Gold cards are essentially rarer variants of other cards, and their sets provide far higher prizes upon accomplishment.
Among the most thrilling concepts in coin, the master is the card trading system. You can offer up to five cards to your friends daily, so it’s a smart idea to join the coin master forums and communities. Many of them have designated card trading sections where you can enter into trading agreements with other coin master players.</p><h3 id=chests>Chests<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chests>#</a></h3><p>You can buy these using in-game coins and all the chests can grant you up to 5-star quality cards. However, as mentioned before he is costlier than the chest, you’ll have a greater chance of bagging high-quality cards and vice-versa. You can also get pet treats, pet XP, or chest bonus spins which are added to the inventory on top of the cards you get and don’t influence the card drop chances.</p><h3 id=card-drop-odds-by-chest>Card Drop Odds By Chest<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#card-drop-odds-by-chest>#</a></h3><p>Solely based on the chest you open up, you have a good chance of winning a unique rareness of the card. Just the mystery, ruby, and valentine’s chests are expected to drop the joker card the rest of them don’t.
Wooden, golden & magical chests are readily accessible after completing the village 2. The small lucky chest is available at village 4, small easter chest at village 10, big easter chest and emerald chest at village 20, valentine’s chest and big lucky chest at village 30, Viking chest and Saphir chest at village 70, fortune chest at village 100, ruby chest at village 110 and finally epic chest at village 130.

The joker card has the potential to turn to any card you desire, including gold cards. Please remember that joker cards have a deadline, so make sure to use them before they expire.</p><h3 id=pets>Pets<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pets>#</a></h3><p>Pets are unveiled by navigating the pet screen from the game menu or by clicking the egg under the slots machine.
Once triggered, your pet can offer you a bonus for the next four hours. When these four hours are over, your pet will fall asleep and you won’t be willing to enjoy their benefits for a considerable amount of time.
You may accelerate their healing by providing them with treats. You can pay actual cash to get food right away or take a spin on the slots machine for a shot to get treats. Treats are offered in addition to the usual compensation you get from your spin result. The benefits given to pets can be improved by offering them XP potions that boost them up.

Rhino<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-rhino>#</a></h3><p>Rhino can be activated by clearing the creature’s card collection.

Foxy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-foxy>#</a></h3><p>Foxy is the very first pet you unleash when you play Coin Master, but it’s also the most important one further in the game. Foxy provides an extra hammer in raids that ensures you’ve got one more opportunity to find a coin or dig a chest. You can unlock foxy at level 4.</p><h2 id=tips-and-tricks>Tips and Tricks<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tips-and-tricks>#</a></h2><h3 id=dont-hoard-your-coins>Don’t hoard your coins<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dont-hoard-your-coins>#</a></h3><p>You are often vulnerable to possible raid stealing out a significant amount of your coin stash. So whenever possible you must spend them especially when you are short of shields or haven’t enabled the Rino pet yet.
Holding a huge stash of coins also makes you a perfect target for big raids. A Big Raid is the highest possible bet Raid that, if effective, could end with the Raider stealing away zillions of your coins.</p><h3 id=big-raids>Big Raids<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#big-raids>#</a></h3><p>If you have a lot of spins at your fingertips, it can be enticing to want to increase your bet number and reap the compounded spin bonus. This is an entirely plausible way to make your Coin revenues quicker. However, it’s best to spare a really rich player from your spins for raiding.
Just above the slots machine, you’ll see a Coin Master assigned to you along with their latest coin stores. Save loads of coins to bet for your Coin Master. As the volume of Coin, you gain from the
Raid is proportional to the amount of Coin the player has on them, by only using Maximum Bets on very wealthy Coin Masters, you have a shot to earn a lot of Coins in a very brief period.

To complete your chest collection get the lower level cards in the beginning levels itself as there is nothing worse than giving up the valuable joker just to replace the missing common card that you could have obtained earlier in the game. Don’t Waste</p><h3 id=your-pets-bonuses>Your Pet’s Bonuses<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#your-pets-bonuses>#</a></h3><p>The enhanced effect of your pet will be activated just for 4 hours so if any chance you are not willing to play for the next 4 hours avoid activating them and use them to your maximum benefit when you can devote 4 hours following the pet’s activation.
