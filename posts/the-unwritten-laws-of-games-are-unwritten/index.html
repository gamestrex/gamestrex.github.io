It became an immensely popular hobby, with millions of people playing on their PC, laptop, console, mobile device and mobile phones every day. However, there are some unwritten rules that all gamers should adhere to. Some people love online gaming, while others like one on one with a friend. Here are the top unwritten rules for gaming.\nPlayer 1 The person with the console or the computer, the player, is valued as the player 1. You’re the best person in order to earn, but your attention becomes one count. In short, it’s their game, and therefore their rules. This does have limitations, of course. They cant cheat or give you ridiculously unfair disadvantage, force you to use a hard computer, or something similar. No matter what, respect the rules of the player.\nPlayer 2 In other words, if you are player 2, you must accept you’re going to get the short end of the stick. As player 2, you’ll probably have the controller that doesn’t work more and sticks a bit. You’ll also have the second choice of everything, character or map, the game that you’ll play. When you’re home, keeping the player two rules isn’t a hard pill to swallow.\nWinner stays Depending on the game and the number of friends you are around, you’ll probably turn up to play. The easiest way to keep this system moving is to make sure that the winner of every game stays. It’s useful to adjust this system for the winner to be much better than anyone else. When you use this King of the Hill type system you can see the difference between this one and the other, you can have a chance and play more than one game.\nCutscenes You must follow two rules when you play with a cutscene. Firstly watch every video without skipping, especially if it is the first time that we play the game, and secondly, he doesn’t talk when there are scenes. Games tell stories. While you’d rather play them and advance the story, cutscenes are a critical part of the film, such as movies. Skipping through them is like fast-forwarding parts of a movie, and to talk about them is just very annoying.\nClean hands Wash your hands before using another PC or controller. It’s really easy to eat and get all your hands dirty and oily with a friend, and then to turn it into a greasy mess. You can do that at home by using the controller, keyboard and mouse. Nevertheless, the gaming community often complains about playing with dirty hands, especially when you use expensive hardware such as a Scuf controller or a custom keyboard.\nPass the controlperson. This does mainly applies to racing games. At the moment, if you are far from the line, pass the controller to someone who is not playing, or simply switch the controllers for a few more games. Watching someone cruise to the hard battle is not fun, it isn’t fun to be dead all the time and not competing. Switch up; this allows for more skilled players to play.\nRespect banned characters. Games like Street Fighter, Tekken, Smash Bros, League of Legends and Dota are all designed for you. If the players are playing against the newbies, the problem is that some characters can be unstoppable in the hands of an experienced player. As a result, the idea of not having to respect that ban isn’t only a way of keeping games very fair; it’s time to change all the time. Repeating the same time as the other three moves will be very fast.\nQuitting isn’t allowed. If you were not a team member, the quitting because you stayed alive, or didn’t come back soon. You end up ruining the games of the left and it isn’t ok. Instead of thinking about the whole game, you shouldn’t be unhappy about how your teammates played against you. In games like FIFA, losing doesn’t mean that you quit, watch the game out, then play another game. It’s a big deal, but you won’t ruin the other side’s fun at all.\nThere is no backseat game to play with. Drive on backseat is easy to do, and the speed of taking backseat does not matter. If you aren’t playing, just let the people who like it make mistakes and die for a stupid reason. That’s their game. You can’t hear that you went wrong, you missed an item, why did you do that, why aren’t you doing that? Let people play what they want to play, and with your help, you can do what you want to.\nMic etiquette This is applicable to online games, but when you are in a multiplayer space, shave your microphone in mind. Nobody wants to listen to your dog barking, or to someone screaming from the back or to what you are eating. It does matter, too, as you may think the songs you were listening to are great, but nobody entered Call of Duty and then listened to your favourite music. If you don’t talk, don’t forget your microphone on; it’s important to turn it off – it’s necessary not to have others listen to you.\nGood game Whether you win or lose, you often type GG in the chat or say it over the mic, no matter what game you play. It’s a simple sign of respect and is like a handshake at the end of a football game. It is not something you have to do, but it gives up quickly how fast every gamer does it all the time.\n","wordCount":"943","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-02T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Rosa Harris"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/the-unwritten-laws-of-games-are-unwritten/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>The Unwritten Laws Of Games Are Unwritten</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-02 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 2, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;943 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Rosa Harris</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#player-1>Player 1</a></li><li><a href=#player-2>Player 2</a></li><li><a href=#winner-stays>Winner stays</a></li><li><a href=#cutscenes>Cutscenes</a></li><li><a href=#clean-hands>Clean hands</a></li><li><a href=#pass-the-controlperson>Pass the controlperson.</a></li><li><a href=#respect-banned-characters>Respect banned characters.</a></li><li><a href=#quitting-isnt-allowed>Quitting isn’t allowed.</a></li><li><a href=#there-is-no-backseat-game-to-play-with>There is no backseat game to play with.</a></li><li><a href=#mic-etiquette>Mic etiquette</a></li><li><a href=#good-game>Good game</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Gaming isn’t just the hobby of young people in their moms.
