The vocal voice of Viera on 4 on combat have been adjusted. The Character Renaming service is now available for players even when servers are congested. However, character name generators will never save a long time, especially in difficult times of server congestion. The following questions have been resolved. The issue of a behavior that accompanying NPCs has weird characteristics in areas with elevation change. In the Chronicles of a Newera quest whose quest Gods of Elds prevented progressing to an early point in the final quest of the endwalker main scenario. Where a person and a wife complete an eighteen dungeon via duty roulette (Teaf 50/60/70/80). In undertaking an quest Searching Inspiration, completion of level eighteon to 89 dungeons by duty roulette proved unreasonable. A question wherein daily quests Ixal require belts. A problem wherein the HP of the tunnel armor was incorrect was with the ship undertaking the Battle of Castrum Lacus Litore. Wherever an objective is to hunt in the 6.0 areas where guildship mark bill does not reward sacks of nuts under certain circumstances. In Thavnair, an issue where enemies spell more often than they intended. An issue when playing gunbreakers wherein number of charged cartridges displayed incorrectly in the Powder Gauge after disengaging levels sync under certain conditions. When you play a ninja, an issue where execution of Hollow Nozuichi was a source of an ending point for the status effects Forked Raiju Juice and Fleeting Raiju Juice to expire. An issue where a description for the trait Enhanced Apex Arrow was incorrect. * The problem didn’t affect this trait’s function. An issue wherein descriptions for samurai PvE actions Mangetsu and Oka put Fuga as their combo actions even after learning the Fuko action. * This issue didn’t affect the function of this action. The issue where the descriptions of the status effect Enhanced Flare erroneously read the next Flare cast will deal increased damage. The task is not related to this point. An issue wherein the description for the sage action Eukrasia didn’t say that its recast timer is unaffected by status or gear attributes. * This issue didn’t affect the functionality of the action. The characterizations of the reaper PvP actions Blood Stalk, Unveiled Gibbet, Unveiled Gallows and Grim Swathe are mistaken. * This problem didn’t affect this operation’s functionality. A problem where the hairstyle Both Ways were incorrectly displayed under certain conditions. It was in a situation where dyes weren’t applied to paladins Idealized Chevalier gear. In this way, one topic where job-specific gear introduced in Patch 6.0 didn’t include IL and affects synced with current job levels in their descriptions. A problem in the last quarter introduced in Patch 6.0 wherein enemies that spawn in FATEs attack players even if this sneak happens. A problem when undertaking the studies orders where the players were granted experience points when crafting the goods necessary to the quest quest. An object where the materials used in the carpenter recipe in the Rarefied Integral Fishing Rod were incorrect. The question is where certain potions restored more HP than they did in certain conditions. An error was discovered on the sales price of Competent Craftsmans Draught, Commanding Craftsmen Draught and Cunning Craftsmans Draught. The difference is that the price of items presented incorrectly when toggling the displays of high and low quality items. A matter in the Lord of Verminion, wherein certain minion action descriptions stated their ATK had 180 tyres, it was in fact higher. In Lord of Verminion, an issue whereby certain poppet minion actions slowed the movement of enemies despite the fact that their descriptions of enemies in range are bound for effect duration. When viewing the credits is a problem wherein players were disseminated forcibly due to inactivity. In the opening movie of the Endwalker, there was an problem where the audio channel was switched, making noise noise irresponsible (PlayStation4 and PlayStation5). When selecting Logitech PRO-G 50mm under Sound Settings, the noise didn’t affect the quality of sound. A question where the possibility of forcing Immerse Spatial Audio to enable sound effects would prevent them from playing under certain conditions. It’s a question where certain sounds don’t play perfectly under certain conditions. * We anticipate that sound issues caused by Patch 6.0 will be solved in sound engines, as they were created by changes. If you fail to experience sound-related problems, we recommend: Open Windows control panel, select your favorite audio device and turn down the properties. Then select a higher setting on the Advanced tab for the standard format. (A low rate and Hz range is less system intensive.) Other minor text issues, too, have been resolved. A problem involving low polygon counts in Labyrinthos caused a reduced of over the amount of grapes in order to reduce the number of memory in this area. * They were adjusted to fit into the Crystarium.\nIf you don’t get an update, you’ll be sure to let us know of that.

The issue of a behavior that accompanying NPCs has weird characteristics in areas with elevation change. In the Chronicles of a Newera quest whose quest Gods of Elds prevented progressing to an early point in the final quest of the endwalker main scenario. Where a person and a wife complete an eighteen dungeon via duty roulette (Teaf 50/60/70/80). In undertaking an quest Searching Inspiration, completion of level eighteon to 89 dungeons by duty roulette proved unreasonable. A question wherein daily quests Ixal require belts. A problem wherein the HP of the tunnel armor was incorrect was with the ship undertaking the Battle of Castrum Lacus Litore. Wherever an objective is to hunt in the 6.0 areas where guildship mark bill does not reward sacks of nuts under certain circumstances. In Thavnair, an issue where enemies spell more often than they intended. An issue when playing gunbreakers wherein number of charged cartridges displayed incorrectly in the Powder Gauge after disengaging levels sync under certain conditions. When you play a ninja, an issue where execution of Hollow Nozuichi was a source of an ending point for the status effects Forked Raiju Juice and Fleeting Raiju Juice to expire. An issue where a description for the trait Enhanced Apex Arrow was incorrect. * The problem didn’t affect this trait’s function. An issue wherein descriptions for samurai PvE actions Mangetsu and Oka put Fuga as their combo actions even after learning the Fuko action. * This issue didn’t affect the function of this action. The issue where the descriptions of the status effect Enhanced Flare erroneously read the next Flare cast will deal increased damage. The task is not related to this point. An issue wherein the description for the sage action Eukrasia didn’t say that its recast timer is unaffected by status or gear attributes. * This issue didn’t affect the functionality of the action. The characterizations of the reaper PvP actions Blood Stalk, Unveiled Gibbet, Unveiled Gallows and Grim Swathe are mistaken. * This problem didn’t affect this operation’s functionality. A problem where the hairstyle Both Ways were incorrectly displayed under certain conditions. It was in a situation where dyes weren’t applied to paladins Idealized Chevalier gear. In this way, one topic where job-specific gear introduced in Patch 6.0 didn’t include IL and affects synced with current job levels in their descriptions. A problem in the last quarter introduced in Patch 6.0 wherein enemies that spawn in FATEs attack players even if this sneak happens. A problem when undertaking the studies orders where the players were granted experience points when crafting the goods necessary to the quest quest. An object where the materials used in the carpenter recipe in the Rarefied Integral Fishing Rod were incorrect. The question is where certain potions restored more HP than they did in certain conditions. An error was discovered on the sales price of Competent Craftsmans Draught, Commanding Craftsmen Draught and Cunning Craftsmans Draught. The difference is that the price of items presented incorrectly when toggling the displays of high and low quality items. A matter in the Lord of Verminion, wherein certain minion action descriptions stated their ATK had 180 tyres, it was in fact higher. In Lord of Verminion, an issue whereby certain poppet minion actions slowed the movement of enemies despite the fact that their descriptions of enemies in range are bound for effect duration. When viewing the credits is a problem wherein players were disseminated forcibly due to inactivity. In the opening movie of the Endwalker, there was an problem where the audio channel was switched, making noise noise irresponsible (PlayStation4 and PlayStation5). When selecting Logitech PRO-G 50mm under Sound Settings, the noise didn’t affect the quality of sound. A question where the possibility of forcing Immerse Spatial Audio to enable sound effects would prevent them from playing under certain conditions. It’s a question where certain sounds don’t play perfectly under certain conditions. * We anticipate that sound issues caused by Patch 6.0 will be solved in sound engines, as they were created by changes. If you fail to experience sound-related problems, we recommend: Open Windows control panel, select your favorite audio device and turn down the properties. Then select a higher setting on the Advanced tab for the standard format. (A low rate and Hz range is less system intensive.) Other minor text issues, too, have been resolved. A problem involving low polygon counts in Labyrinthos caused a reduced of over the amount of grapes in order to reduce the number of memory in this area. * They were adjusted to fit into the Crystarium.</p><p>If you don’t get an update, you’ll be sure to let us know of that.
