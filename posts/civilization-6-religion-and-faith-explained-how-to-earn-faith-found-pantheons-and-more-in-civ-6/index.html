A quick note: we’ve refreshed out Civ 6 guides for the game’s launch on Nintendo Switch, but just be aware that they contain information regarding the Rise and Fall DLC as well as the base game, which means some things only apply if you have that DLC! Otherwise… crack on!\rFor those uninitiated to the ways of Civilization however - or anyone returning after a little break - opening up that Religious beliefs menu for the first time to see a whole screen of percentages and bonuses can be paralyzing, so below we’ve quickly broken down, in simple terms, how Religion and Faith work in Civ 6.\nReligion is both a victory condition and a general benefit - Just like Culture or Science, Religion can play a role of varying importance in your Civ 6 playthrough, and is by no means only something to think about when going for the Religious Victory.

The first thing you’ll do is found a Pantheon - Like a mini pre-Religion, Pantheons offer long-term benefits from their respective beliefs. To found one, you’ll need to amass 16 Faith, at which point you’ll be prompted to make your choice of belief. A Religion is then founded when you acquire a Great Prophet - Great Prophets, one of the many types of Great People in Civ 6, are earned when you have accrued enough Great Person points of that type. Those are earned from various buildings and wonders, such as your Holy Site and it’s buildings. A Great Prophet can also be acquired by completing the Stonehenge Wonder. With a Religion foudned, you can then go about adding new beliefs - Once founded, all cities in your civ with a Holy Site will convert to your new Religion.
