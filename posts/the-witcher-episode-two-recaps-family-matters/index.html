Again we see a lot of placing on Ciri’s young shoulders, and again, she proves that she is much stronger than she looks. Lambert is at an unusual rate during this episode, which is the biggest shock of all time. Before we get stuck in the utmost respect for Ciri and Geralt, let’s get into the final moments that I believe will be the most successful. In spite of their mother’s loss, Francesca and Filavandrel decide to leave Nilfgaard. It’s revealed that Dara is a Redandian spy who knew with Dijkstra about what was going down. Dara decides not to do that anymore right before the baby is murdered. He blames himself for her death. Francesca tells me it wasn’t his fault. And they leave for Redania, her hatred of the people is restored. Once she leaves for a thirty, she cuts down to every baby, before dying all in one fell swoop. It’s a frightening scene where several babies scream before the silence of the mother erupts, and then become chastised. Francesca wants justice for her people, not revenge, and it won’t be the last time we see brutality from her. Episode 8 The “family” is a “family”. Lauren Schmidt Hissrich was written by him. Ed Bazalgette is the director. In the Nord, Tissaia and Vilgefortz get a visit from Dijkstra, who told them in the previous episode that Ciri was power. Tissaia believes that the child is too powerful even if it is a Brotherhood; therefore she organizes a meeting with King Foltest, King Henselt and Queen Meve to decide whether they should kill that girl and all the people who protect them, with the exception of Geralt and the Witchers. In Redania, the King Vizimir wishes to combine their kingdoms with marriage so he can be a part of the most powerful Northern kingdom of the world. You’re pretty bad, aren’t you? At least in Nilfgaardians, they’re telling you a moment before their killings. The list of those who hunt Ciri grows longer, while she is now in danger of killing Witchers. Voleth Meir sees in Ciri that she hardly misses her family; so takes her to the grand hall, where they find her grandmother and Mousesack. This keeps Ciri distracted and happy while Voleth Meir can use her body for the bid. Vesemir instructs the Witchers to take whatever elixirs they can, and Geralt persuades Vesemir to try his way first: to leave a whole bunch of creatures alive from Ciri. Yen recruits Jaskier for potion-making duties, which do you’d imagine doing as well. He was tasked with bringing Jasper to Geralt, a stone that can correct wrongs. Keep in mind that Voleth Meir feeds off hatred and despair, as it will be important later. Voleth Meir shouts at the Medallion tree in which he discovers a tiny monolith inside. This shatters and opens a portal through which two basilics erupted. The witchers try to get through to Ciri while Geralt seems to be unable to imagine it. Vesemir eventually frightened Maria Meir, but her wounds heal. Jaskier manages to tell Geralt a few moments ago that if Voleth Meir explains why he hates the Witcher and he’s letting his hair down to the fact that he was not the Witcher, and that she hasn’t realized that they’ve been doing that all wrong.

Even David had some positive comments. Yen sees what’s happening then realizes she can sacrifice herself to save Ciri and sell it for an extended time. She slit her hands and the Witchers pushed Ciri out of her dream state and told her family. Now Ciri leaves the grand hall and returns to Kaer Morhen, leaving Voleth Meir in Yen’s body. Ciri opens a portal, but before Yen can expel Voleth Meir, they’re thrown through it. They reemerge in red land and Voleth Meir floats away. This is quick. But before they can get their bearings, they see a band of horsemen heading towards them. It’s a wild hunt, and they’re asking Ciri to join them. As soon as they get to Yen and Geralt, Ciri clings to Glinne and teleports them back to Kaer Morhen. We see, for the first time, that Ciri is capable of teleporting, but she’s capable of travelling to other countries. That’s very good news there. Yen and Geralt agree that Yen will train Ciri and together they will protect her. Hurry for family! In Redania, Istredd is captured by the Eleven and then reveals his existence as Hen Ikeir, meaning he was a king of death. Francesca realizes that Ciri could help them restore the elves, since they are effective leaders of the continent, so a second party is seeking her. And finally, both big reveals. I remarked that everybody wants to talk to anyone, and I was right. Phillipa is Vizimir’s court mage and polymorphes make her a polymorphed animal. She is an old boy and is one of the best of the world, so it’s definitely worth seeing how her character develops in season three. Philip and Dijkstra are in an octopus, but in other words a bad news for everyone. In Cintra, Fringilla and Cahir wax lyrical to Emperor Emhyr that they always planned to turn the elves on Redania and ordered the murder of the child. It’s all fair and good, except Emhyr was the murderer, and he was thrown away for a thorny killing. But what does Emperor do with Ciri? Those who watch closely will recognise his voice and dark hair and not unlike Duny’s widow’s father. And that’s for the second season. We will have to wait two years for season 3. Because I can’t wait to find out what the heroes will be waiting for. Hope of the king of the soul.\n","wordCount":"1134","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-20T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Katherine Galea"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/the-witcher-episode-two-recaps-family-matters/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>The Witcher Episode Two Recaps Family Matters</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 20, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1134 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Katherine Galea</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>(Image credit: Netflix)
