If your goal is to buy the biggest display for your gaming dollars, then the 17.3-inch Nitro, powered by GeForce RTX 3080 graphics and AMD’s massive Ryzen 5800H CPU, is worth your attention. This review is part of the ongoing list of the best laptops. Go and find out how we tested these products.\nSpecifications The new model is at $2,099.99. It pairs the AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU with GeForce RTX 3080 graphics. Here’s our total spec list: — our review unit.\nCPU: Snapdragon 7 7 5800H Intel. Memory: 16GB Graphics: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 with 100 TGP rating. Storage: 1TB-TB PVMe M2 SSD. A display: 17.3 inches, 19201280. The videocam is 1080p from the resonator. Connectivity: Right side: 1.30 oz USB Superspeed 10gbps Type-C, 2.30 oz USB Superspeed 5gbps Type-A, HDMI 2.0. Left hand side: 2x USB SuperSpeed 10Gbps Type-A (one with power-off charging), ethernet, jack combo. Networking: Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5,0. Biometrics: None. 57.5 hours of battery life: battery capacity. Measures: 15,9 x 11,0 x 0.98 inch. Exactly 5 lbs. / 2 lbs. /Alta/cylindrical capacity 1 / 1/ / Irres in weight.\nAcer sells a variety of Nitro-5 models, but cheaper, and also cheaper versions of 17.3 mm and 5. The initial model costs $1,450 and features RTX 3060 graphics while the mid-range version costs $1,700 with RTX 3070 graphics. The three models have the same CPU that Ryzen 5800H, 16GB of RAM and 1TB SSD. This mid-tier configuration has a QHD (25601440), where the top and bottom models have a FHD (201280). The baseline version with significantly lower RTX 3050 Ti graphics, and an Intel processor are also available in the 17-inch form factor for $1,100.\nWe have an amazing Nitro 5 design. No matter what size you chose, Nitro 5 comes in a bulky plastic bin. Such a design makes sense when the price is about a dollar or less, but it’s harder to justify when the price goes above $2,000. That means that 17-inch laptops with RTX 3080 graphics usually cost a thousand dollars more than the Nitro 5 of the house. Those two wheels look beautiful, with little flex and no creaking that can destroy plastic designs. I wouldn’t call Nitro 5 svelte, but it weighs less than other 17-inch gaming laptops recently we reviewed and weighed. The Nitro 5 weighs not too much in comparison to the MSI GE76 Raider and Gigabyte Aorus 17G, both of which weigh 6,6 pounds. The 180-watt power brick costs 1.2 pounds to carry weight, while the 280-watt power bricks of the MSI and Gigabyte machines weigh a lot more than 0.2 pounds each. Matt Elliott/IG. If youre familiar with the popular 15-inch Nitro 5, then you’ll immediately recognize its 17-inch sibling. He follows the same principles: a swivel body with angular accents and red vent covers. That lightweight plastic bezel is the cheapest part of the design. Thinning them out a little and adding a glossy finish would improve the overall aesthetic. To its best, it’s a lightweight laptop. This configuration is really packed with high-end components. The keyboard is for gamers. The arrow keys and the WASD keys are added with a white border and are lighted with RGB backlighting. These keys guide gamers to the most popular keys. In addition to all 17-inch laptops, the keyboard includes a dedicated number pad. Using 15-inch laptops, the number pads are slightly narrower and the left Shift key gets cut to accommodate the full-sized arrow keys. The letter and number pad keys can be folded onto either side of the keyboard. It’s a bummer that Acer didn’t take advantage of the space that had grown up and produce a roomier keyboard. The shortened Right-Shift key may have little impact when it comes to gaming, but it was annoying for the general Windows user. Matt Elliott/IDG. There’s also one other key outlined in white, except for the WASD and arrow keys. The special N key above the numpad has introduced the Acers NitroSense utility, which lets you adjust the laptop’s power modes and fan speed. On a touchscreen, there are 4 zone zones and 4 color schemes. Matt Elliott/IDG. The touchpad looks thin, despite the large expanse of the wide keyboard deck surrounding it. Its shape is really bad, and this is the only problem. This felt good, but the clicked was perfect for the day.\nDisplay in fine HD at 17,3oz. The 17.3-inch pixel screen has a full HD (191080) resolution. It works well with gaming and web browsing, but, the step-down model is also nicer with a 425601440. Most gamers need anything above 1080p, but the high resolution would make the Nitro 5 more good for general use. For example, content creators will appreciate better resolution for photo and video editing. Matt Elliott and the IDG merged. The biggest problem with this display is its lack of brightness. If you do the most of your games in a darkened city, you’ll get good. In sunnier environments, you can’t be caught from the light without even getting to feel even worse. The wide angle of the screen is in contrast to the brightness. A bright LED doesn’t get any more luminous when you come out of the center. The 720p webcam is completely unsuitable. Even in a fast-ideal environment, the webcam produces a grainy image with oversaturated colors. It’s also lacking in privacy. The speakers give a great laptop sound. Their sound can fill a small room, but there is little bass. YouTube and Zoom calls sound good, but you wanna use your headphones to play and watch movies. Matt Elliott and the group of the Israelis. Matt Elliott/IDG The ports are not accompanied by pleasant surprises. That’s not enough for a dongle. As with other AMD laptops, the USB-C port doesn’t support Thunderbolt. Matt Elliott/IDG The 1TB M.2 SSD lets you store a large game library. If there’s no enough room to take a trip in about 2.5 o’clock. Acer also includes the necessary cable and screws in the box, so that you can make an addition to this kind of thing easy. It’s necessary that the 2 8GB laptops have only two DIMM slots, to increase the workload of 16 GB of RAM.\nAcer Nitro 5 performance was achieved by acer. Our Nitro 5 AN517 test is based on AMD’s octo-core Ryzen 7 5800H CPU and Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3080 GPU. Certain versions of the RTX 3080 are full of 16GB of VRAM, but this one is not more of the common 8GB extortion. The GPU has a minimum total graph power (GA) of 100 Watts to keep the temperature in check. Some performance will be shown with RTX 30-80 GPUs. We have most of the 155Watt range. We compared the Nitro 5 and other gaming laptops as the Asus ROG Zephyrus S17, the Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition, the MSI GS66, and the Dell XPS 179710. Acer’s Nitro 5 AN515, which weighs 15 pounds, was also included. The GPUs of AMD and Intel both have 8 physical cores and 16 processing threads. In order to find out how hard a laptop handles a load of shards for a long time, we used HandBrake, which allows free video to encode the content and code of the computer. By transcoding a 30GB MKV file to a format suitable for Android tablets, the Nitro 5 topped the Core i7-based Dell XPS 17 9710 but finished behind a few other systems. Those are killings row of graphics powerhouses, however. All proved they encoded videos with relatively quick times. Matt Elliott/GDF? Cinebench is another CPU-intensive test, but that makes a complex 2D scene in a short time. The Nitro 5 came fourth with only 15 inches in the face. The Nitro 5, which scores two times more than the usual 4th, is more than capable of handling big photo editing tasks. The single-threaded score of all the laptops here was excellent, except the MSI GS66 Stealth which was well behind the Nitro five. Matt Elliott and the Interims. Matt Elliott/IDG\nGraphics performance The Nitro 5 did a very good job in terms of graphics. When we ran Time Spy 1.2 on 3DMark (these cinematic clips are designed to push the GPU to its limits), the Radeon RX 6800M-based Asus RX Strix G15 and the RTX 3080-based Asus ROG Zephyrus S17 reached 10,000 scores. The Nitro 5 didn’t come close to the point. I think that these laptops have the best advantage on the CPU, namely: Ryzen or Core i9 processors. Matt Elliott and the idgy Department of Energy. For real-world game testing, we played Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 191080 resolution with the best graphics preset and Metro Exodus at 191080 with the highest graphics preset. After playing Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Nitro 5 turned in 97 fps. The more demanding Metro Exodus measured only 42 fps. Also, you need to a little more enjoyable experience. Matt Elliott/IDG Matt Elliott/IDG, the association of intellectual property, and social property professionals.\nBattery life The Nitro 5 lasted nearly six hours on our battery-drain test, which is around average for games. We have a computer and a power switch with a DVD player and an audio recording on the Mac. However, battery life isn’t important on a big gaming laptop that will spend the most time on a wall outlet. Matt Elliott and the IDG are all interested in this work.\nPerformance, design and performance. If you’re looking for the best price for a gaming buck, the 17-inch Acer Nitro 5 is a good buy. A re-reading experience along with AMD’s excellent Ryzen 7 5800H and a roomy 1TB SSD for $2,100 is a great deal, as most laptops with the same graphics are priced closer to $3,000. If you imagine that a premium laptop with aluminum chassis and bright display with colors popping, then you’ll be less enamored at the Nitro 5:10 p.m.\n","wordCount":"1784","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-17T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-17T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Stuart Barnhart"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/the-new-mini-laptop-from-acer-nitro-is-extremely-powerful/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>The New Mini Laptop From Acer Nitro Is Extremely Powerful</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-17 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 17, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1784 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Stuart Barnhart</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#you-get-the-best-price-today>You get the best price today.</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#specifications>Specifications</a></li><li><a href=#we-have-an-amazing-nitro-5-design>We have an amazing Nitro 5 design.</a></li><li><a href=#display-in-fine-hd-at-173oz>Display in fine HD at 17,3oz.</a></li><li><a href=#acer-nitro-5-performance-was-achieved-by-acer>Acer Nitro 5 performance was achieved by acer.</a></li><li><a href=#graphics-performance>Graphics performance</a></li><li><a href=#battery-life>Battery life</a></li><li><a href=#performance-design-and-performance>Performance, design and performance.</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h3 id=you-get-the-best-price-today>You get the best price today.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#you-get-the-best-price-today>#</a></h3><p>Retailer Price Delivery $2,259.00 View Prices for more than 24 thousand stores in the world are comparable to that of one in four stores worldwide.

If youre familiar with the popular 15-inch Nitro 5, then you’ll immediately recognize its 17-inch sibling. He follows the same principles: a swivel body with angular accents and red vent covers.

The 1TB M.2 SSD lets you store a large game library. If there’s no enough room to take a trip in about 2.5 o’clock. Acer also includes the necessary cable and screws in the box, so that you can make an addition to this kind of thing easy. It’s necessary that the 2 8GB laptops have only two DIMM slots, to increase the workload of 16 GB of RAM.</p><h2 id=acer-nitro-5-performance-was-achieved-by-acer>Acer Nitro 5 performance was achieved by acer.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#acer-nitro-5-performance-was-achieved-by-acer>#</a></h2><p>Our Nitro 5 AN517 test is based on AMD’s octo-core Ryzen 7 5800H CPU and Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3080 GPU. Certain versions of the RTX 3080 are full of 16GB of VRAM, but this one is not more of the common 8GB extortion. The GPU has a minimum total graph power (GA) of 100 Watts to keep the temperature in check. Some performance will be shown with RTX 30-80 GPUs. We have most of the 155Watt range.
We compared the Nitro 5 and other gaming laptops as the Asus ROG Zephyrus S17, the Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition, the MSI GS66, and the Dell XPS 179710. Acer’s Nitro 5 AN515, which weighs 15 pounds, was also included. The GPUs of AMD and Intel both have 8 physical cores and 16 processing threads.
In order to find out how hard a laptop handles a load of shards for a long time, we used HandBrake, which allows free video to encode the content and code of the computer. By transcoding a 30GB MKV file to a format suitable for Android tablets, the Nitro 5 topped the Core i7-based Dell XPS 17 9710 but finished behind a few other systems. Those are killings row of graphics powerhouses, however. All proved they encoded videos with relatively quick times.

Cinebench is another CPU-intensive test, but that makes a complex 2D scene in a short time. The Nitro 5 came fourth with only 15 inches in the face. The Nitro 5, which scores two times more than the usual 4th, is more than capable of handling big photo editing tasks. The single-threaded score of all the laptops here was excellent, except the MSI GS66 Stealth which was well behind the Nitro five.

Matt Elliott/IDG</p><h2 id=graphics-performance>Graphics performance<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#graphics-performance>#</a></h2><p>The Nitro 5 did a very good job in terms of graphics. When we ran Time Spy 1.2 on 3DMark (these cinematic clips are designed to push the GPU to its limits), the Radeon RX 6800M-based Asus RX Strix G15 and the RTX 3080-based Asus ROG Zephyrus S17 reached 10,000 scores. The Nitro 5 didn’t come close to the point. I think that these laptops have the best advantage on the CPU, namely: Ryzen or Core i9 processors.
Matt Elliott and the idgy Department of Energy.
For real-world game testing, we played Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 191080 resolution with the best graphics preset and Metro Exodus at 191080 with the highest graphics preset. After playing Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Nitro 5 turned in 97 fps. The more demanding Metro Exodus measured only 42 fps. Also, you need to a little more enjoyable experience.

Matt Elliott/IDG, the association of intellectual property, and social property professionals.</p><h2 id=battery-life>Battery life<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#battery-life>#</a></h2><p>The Nitro 5 lasted nearly six hours on our battery-drain test, which is around average for games. We have a computer and a power switch with a DVD player and an audio recording on the Mac. However, battery life isn’t important on a big gaming laptop that will spend the most time on a wall outlet.
Matt Elliott and the IDG are all interested in this work.</p><h2 id=performance-design-and-performance>Performance, design and performance.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#performance-design-and-performance>#</a></h2><p>If you’re looking for the best price for a gaming buck, the 17-inch Acer Nitro 5 is a good buy. A re-reading experience along with AMD’s excellent Ryzen 7 5800H and a roomy 1TB SSD for $2,100 is a great deal, as most laptops with the same graphics are priced closer to $3,000. If you imagine that a premium laptop with aluminum chassis and bright display with colors popping, then you’ll be less enamored at the Nitro 5:10 p.m.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/the-medium-free-download-v1-2-nexus-games/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Medium Free Download V1 2 Nexus Games</span></a>
