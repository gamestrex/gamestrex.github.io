Rarity: 5-Star. Weapon: Sword. Banner: Twirling Lotus. Best build: Hybrid main and sub DPS. Normal Attack: Dance of Samser. Elemental Skill: Dance of Haftkarsvar. Elemental Burst: Dance of Abzendegi - Distant Dreams, Listening Spring. Passive one: Court of Dancing Petals (When your entire party is Dendro and Hydro, Nilou grants all characters the Golden Chalice’s Bounty for 30 seconds after her third dance step of Dance of Haftarsvar, which increases Elemental Mastery by 100 for 10 seconds whenever they are hit by Dendro attacks, and triggering Bloom reactions will create Bountiful Cores in place of Dendro Cores which have a larger Area of Effect - but Bountiful Cores can’t trigger Hyperbloom or Burgeon). Passive two: Dreamy Dance of Aeons (Every 1,000 HP after 30,000 will cause the damage of Bountiful Cores to increase by 9%, with a maximum increase of 400%). Cooking bonus: White Jade Lotus (There is a 12% chance to obtain double food when Perfect Cooking is performed).\nNilou Normal Attack - Dance of Samser It’s the standard sword strikes for Nilou with her normal attack, as she’s able to perform up to three consecutive stikes, or charge and consume stamina to perform a twirling slash. Plunging from the air instead damages opponents on her way down and causes AOE (Area of Effect) damage upon impact.\nNilou Elemental Skill - Dance of Haftkarsvar Nilou enters a Pirouette state, dealing Hydro damage to nearby opponents based on her maximum HP. If Nilou then uses a normal attack on her third ‘dance step’, she will enter the Sword Dance stance, whereas if she uses her Elemental Skill on the third dance step, she enters the Whirling Steps stance instead. While in the Sword Dance stance, Nilou unleashes a Luminous Illusion, dealing Hydro damage to opponents and granting the Lunar Prayer effect, which converts her normal attacks into Sword Dance techniques, with her final hit unleashing a Luminous Illusion. Whereas in the Whirling Steps stance, Nilou creates a Whirling Water Wheel that deals AOE Hydro damage and creates a Tranquility Aura that follows the active character, applying Wet to opponents within its AOE.\nNilou Elemental Burst - Dance of Abzendegi: Distant Dreams, Listening Spring Begins a dance that causes a Lotus of Distant Waters to bloom, dealing AOE Hydro damage scaled off Nilou’s maximum HP and applying the Lingering Aeon effect to any opponents hit. After a short interval, opponents affected by lingering Aeon will take Hydro damage.\nGenshin Impact Nilou Talent materials To get the most out of using Nilou, you will have to level her skills up by using Talent materials, which vary from character-to-character.\rFor Nilou, you’ll need to farm a lot of Praxis and Crystalline Cyst Dust materials (if you don’t already have them) to fully upgrade her capabilities. As Nilou has three Talents, you will have to spend three times the Talent materials listed below to fully upgrade all of her abilities, which we’ve also detailed below the table.\rHere’s what Nilou Talent materials and Mora you need to improve one of her abilities:\rHere’s what Talent Materials you’ll need to fully upgrade one of Nilou’s skills:\nx1 Crown of Insight x3 Teachings of Praxis x6 Fungal Spores x6 Tears of the Calamitous God x21 Guide to Praxis x22 Luminescent Pollen x31 Crystalline Cyst Dust x38 Philosophies to Praxis 1,652,500 Mora\nTo upgrade all three of Nilou’s skills, here’s all the Talent Materials you’ll need:\nx3 Crown of Insight x9 Teachings of Praxis x18 Fungal Spores x18 Tears of the Calamitous God x63 Guide to Praxis x66 Luminescent Pollen x93 Crystalline Cyst Dust x114 Philosophies to Praxis 4,957,500 Mora\nGenshin Impact Nilou Ascension materials Just like Talents, you need to use Nilou Ascension materials to upgrade her health, attack, defence, and critical hit effectiveness.\rYou’ll need to farm a lot of Padisarah and Perpetual Caliber materials for Nilou (if you don’t already have them) to fully upgrade her capabilities. Unlike Talent materials, you only need to spend the below Ascension materials once to fully raise Nilou to her highest character level. There is also Acquaint Fate rewarded for reaching certain Ascension levels. You can spend this Fate on the standard and beginner Banners to Wish for characters and weapons.\rHere’s what Nilou Ascension materials and Mora you need to upgrade her for each Ascension level:\rIn total, here’s all the Ascension Materials you need for Nilou in Genshin Impact:\nx1 Varunada Lazurite Sliver x6 Varunada Lazurite Gemstone x9 Varunada Lazurite Fragment x9 Varunada Lazurite Chunk x18 Fungal Spores x30 Luminescent Pollen x36 Crystalline Cyst Dust x46 Perpetual Caliber x168 Padisarah 420,000 Mora\nGenshin Impact Nilou Constellation By getting duplicates of Nilou from wishing on Banners, you will receive her Stella Fortuna. This material allows you to unlock Constellation levels, with each upgrade either improving an existing Talent or Passive ability.\rHere are all of Nilou’s Constellation level upgrades in Genshin Impact:\nDance of the Waning Moon (C1): During Nilou’s Elemental Skill, Dance of Haftkarsvar, Luminous Illusion damage is increased by 65%, and Tranquility Aura’s duration is extended by six seconds. The Starry Skies Their Flowers Rain (C2): An opponent’s Hydro OR Dendro Resistance is decreased by 35% for 10 seconds depending on if a character under the effect of Golden Chalice’s Bounty deals Hydro or Dendro damage to that opponent. Beguiling Shadowstep (C3): Increases the level of Dance of Abzendegi: Distant Dreams, Listening Spring by three, with a maximum upgrade level of 15. Fricative Pulse (C4): Nilou gains 15 Elemental Energy and damage from her Elemental Burst is increased by 50% for eight seconds when the third dance step of her Elemental Skill, Haftkarsvar’s Pirouette, hits opponents. Funerary Rite: Twirling Light (C5): Increases the level of Dance of Haftkarsvar by three. Frostbreaker’s Melody (C6): For every 1,000 HP, Nilou’s crit will increase by 0.6% with a maximum increase of 30%, and her crit damage is increased by 1.2% with a maximum increase of 60%.\nHow to play Nilou in Genshin Impact Nilou has a very specific playstyle that requires you to have only Hydro and Dendro characters in your party in order to take full advantage of her talents. While you can insert her into other party types, it should only really be in place of characters you haven’t pulled yet, and even then we wouldn’t really recommend it unless you’re only playing Nilou for her unique dance attacks on field, and not her damage potential with the right party. The best way to build Nilou is as a sort of hybrid main DPS and sub DPS. This is because you’ll need at least one Dendro teammate to apply Dendro to enemies, and then you’ll use Nilou to apply Hydro to create a Bloom reaction and produce Dendro Cores. With Nilou’s Court of Dancing Petals passive talent, she’ll create Bountiful Cores instead of Dendro Cores, which have a greater AOE, and take about a sixth of the time to explode - making them better for DPS potential. This Golden Chalice’s Bounty effect from Court of Dancing Petals lasts 30 seconds and increases the Elemental Mastery of all teammates for thirty seconds. You’ll want to be applying this effect as often as possible, which means you’ll need a Hydro or Dendro healer on your team to support the damage you’ll be taking from Nilou’s Bountiful Cores. This damage is unavoidable in a good Nilou team, as you actually need to take this damage to lower an enemy’s resistance to Hydro or Dendro in order to increase your DPS. To ensure you’re lowering an enemy’s Hydro or Dendro resistance, keep pressing the Elemental Skill button after you activate it until you see a blue aura around Nilou, as if you use a normal attack as the third input after activating her skill, Nilou will go into a different stance, which won’t help you with this particular playstyle. We also don’t recommend using a Nilou team for single enemy encounters, as your team needs to produce two Dendro Cores to maximise damage potential, and only one is achievable at a time with single targets. In short, spam Nilou’s Elemental Skill as often as possible in your rotations, then create a Bloom reaction with at least one Dendro teammate to produce Bountiful Cores, and heal when required, as these cores should be exploding often if you’re rotating correctly.\nBest Nilou team comp in Genshin Impact It’s very important to build a good team with Nilou or you’ll produce lacklustre damage and might struggle in important encounters otherwise. The main thing you need to remember is that you are going to need a team of only Hydro and Dendro when Nilou is on your team to get the most out of her Talents. As there aren’t many Dendro characters in the game at the moment, your options are limited in that regard. They’ll be used to create Dendro Cores primarily, so we recommend the Dendro Traveler for this, or even Collei, but she has a slightly more difficult application method. As your team will be taking damage from lots of Nilou’s Dendro and Bountiful Cores, you will also need a Dendro or Hydro healer. As there’s currently no Dendro healer in the game, it’ll have to be a Hydro healer, and the best option for this is Kokomi. As a free-to-play option, you can also slot Barbara into this healer role, but Kokomi is vastly superior, so you should use her in your Nilou team if you have her. The fourth slot in most teams are usually quite flexible, but as you can only have Hydro or Dendro characters in a good Nilou team, your fourth slot will depend on who you have. That said, we currently recommend a Hydro character, as there are more of them available, and you can produce Bloom reaction quicker with a Hydro character who can apply Wet often, like Xingqiu or even Ayato or Yelan. Keep in mind that 5-Star Nahida is likely to debut in the 3.2 update, who will be better at applying Dendro support than the Dendro Traveler, or even in the same team as them, based on beta information. As always, we’ll have to wait to see if this is accurate when she is officially released, but it’s likely Nahida will be required for the best Nilou team in the future.\nBest Nilou Artifacts in Genshin Impact With at least one Dendro character needed for Nilou’s best build and team comp, you should have someone on your team with the four-piece Deepwood Memories. Ideally, this should be on a Dendro character to boost their Dendro damage, but any party member can equip Deepwood Memories to help decrease enemies’ Dendro resistance and raise your party’s DPS potential. Specifically for Nilou herself, we recommend the two-piece Tenacity of the Millelith for a 20% health increase. The other two-piece is based on what your particular team comp needs. Emblem of Severed Fate has you covered for a 20% Energy Recharge increase, Heart of Depth increases your Hydro damage by 15%, Noblesse Oblige increases Elemental Burst damage by 20% - there’s a lot of options here, so go through what you have and pick what seems best for your party. Lastly, for all Artifacts, you should have HP as your main and sub-stat priority.\nBest Nilou weapon in Genshin Impact As with most signatures, the 5-Star Key of Khaj-Nisut sword sword is Nilou’s best weapon in Genshin Impact. Signature weapons are basically custom built for characters, as is the case with the Key of Khaj-Nisut sword and Nilou. The Key of Khaj-Nisut sword increases Nilou’s HP by a massive 66.2%, and increases HP by a further 20% at Refinement Rank 1 (R1), increasing to 40% at R5. As well as this huge health increase (which some of Nilou’s attacks scale off of), her Elemental Mastery increases by 0.12% of her Maximum HP at R1 when Nilou activates her Elemental Skill. When it reaches three stacks, or the third stack refreshes, other party members will receive a 0.2% Elemental Mastery increase for 20 seconds at R1, scaled off Nilou’s maximum health.\nIf you don’t want to spend your Fate on Wishing on character and weapon Banners, however, then you can repurpose other 5-Star swords instead, most notably the Primordial Jade Cutter for its HP increase. However, you might want to consider a sword that gives your more crit or Elemental Mastery, like the Mistsplitter Reforged, as your Artifact sub-stats need to prioritise HP. As for 4-Star weapon options, the Favonius Sword and Xiphos’ Moonlight seem to be great options for Nilou if you need Energy Particles for her Burst, or another teammate’s Burst. Genshin Impact version 3.3 is here, with new codes, and new character Scaramouche (Wanderer), so find out where he’s placed on our tier list. You’ll need Primogems and luck of the Pity and 50/50 systems to Wish with Fate for him and other current and next banners. You’ll also need the right Adventure Rank for events. For more Sumeru help, we’ve got pages on Sumeru Reputation, Tree of Dreams, Dendroculus locations, the Aeonblight Drake boss, the Garden of Endless Pillars Domain, and locations for Nilotpala Lotus, Padisarah, Scarabs, and Redcrest.\rYou can also now unlock the Genius Invokation TCG and, if you want help building your deck, check out our Genius Invokation TCG Card List.\rIf you want to relax, however, why not try fishing at one of the many fishing spot locations?\nBest Nilou build in Genshin Impact If you want to take advantage of her very specific hybrid sub and main DPS capabilities, we have compiled what we think is currently the best Nilou build in Genshin Impact:\nNilou Best Weapon: 5-Star Key of Khaj-Nisut sword. Nilou Best Artifacts: 2-piece Tenacity of the Millelith and 2-piece Noblesse Oblige. Nilou Best team comp: Kokomi, Dendro Traveler, Xingqiu.\nIt’s up to you whether the time it takes to farm for Nilou’s materials in order to raise her stats is worth it, as she has a very specific playstyle, with an equally specific team comp needed to make her talents work as best they can. Nilou may get even better when more Dendro supports are added in the future, but for now, she does take a lot of work to maintain a good DPS output. Good luck levelling up Nilou in Genshin Impact!\n","wordCount":"2620","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-21T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Joseph Jones"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/genshin-impact-nilou-best-build-talent-ascension-materials-constellation-team-and-weapon/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Genshin Impact Nilou Best Build Talent Ascension Materials Constellation Team And Weapon</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-21 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 21, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2620 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Joseph Jones</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#genshin-impact-nilou-talents-skills-star-element-and-weapon>Genshin Impact Nilou Talents, skills, star, element, and weapon</a><ul><li><a href=#nilou-normal-attack---dance-of-samser>Nilou Normal Attack - Dance of Samser</a></li><li><a href=#nilou-elemental-skill---dance-of-haftkarsvar>Nilou Elemental Skill - Dance of Haftkarsvar</a></li><li><a href=#nilou-elemental-burst---dance-of-abzendegi-distant-dreams-listening-spring>Nilou Elemental Burst - Dance of Abzendegi: Distant Dreams, Listening Spring</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#genshin-impact-nilou-talent-materials>Genshin Impact Nilou Talent materials</a></li><li><a href=#genshin-impact-nilou-ascension-materials>Genshin Impact Nilou Ascension materials</a></li><li><a href=#genshin-impact-nilou-constellation>Genshin Impact Nilou Constellation</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-play-nilou-in-genshin-impact>How to play Nilou in Genshin Impact</a></li><li><a href=#best-nilou-team-comp-in-genshin-impact>Best Nilou team comp in Genshin Impact</a></li><li><a href=#best-nilou-artifacts-in-genshin-impact>Best Nilou Artifacts in Genshin Impact</a></li><li><a href=#best-nilou-weapon-in-genshin-impact>Best Nilou weapon in Genshin Impact</a></li><li><a href=#best-nilou-build-in-genshin-impact>Best Nilou build in Genshin Impact</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Nilou is featured as the boosted 5-Star character in her Twirling Lotus Banner in version 3.1, but she will eventually return at some point in the future when the Banner schedule cycles back to her.

Plunging from the air instead damages opponents on her way down and causes AOE (Area of Effect) damage upon impact.</p><h3 id=nilou-elemental-skill---dance-of-haftkarsvar>Nilou Elemental Skill - Dance of Haftkarsvar<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#nilou-elemental-skill---dance-of-haftkarsvar>#</a></h3><p>Nilou enters a Pirouette state, dealing Hydro damage to nearby opponents based on her maximum HP. If Nilou then uses a normal attack on her third &lsquo;dance step&rsquo;, she will enter the Sword Dance stance, whereas if she uses her Elemental Skill on the third dance step, she enters the Whirling Steps stance instead.
While in the Sword Dance stance, Nilou unleashes a Luminous Illusion, dealing Hydro damage to opponents and granting the Lunar Prayer effect, which converts her normal attacks into Sword Dance techniques, with her final hit unleashing a Luminous Illusion.
Whereas in the Whirling Steps stance, Nilou creates a Whirling Water Wheel that deals AOE Hydro damage and creates a Tranquility Aura that follows the active character, applying Wet to opponents within its AOE.</p><h3 id=nilou-elemental-burst---dance-of-abzendegi-distant-dreams-listening-spring>Nilou Elemental Burst - Dance of Abzendegi: Distant Dreams, Listening Spring<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#nilou-elemental-burst---dance-of-abzendegi-distant-dreams-listening-spring>#</a></h3><p>Begins a dance that causes a Lotus of Distant Waters to bloom, dealing AOE Hydro damage scaled off Nilou&rsquo;s maximum HP and applying the Lingering Aeon effect to any opponents hit. After a short interval, opponents affected by lingering Aeon will take Hydro damage.</p><h2 id=genshin-impact-nilou-talent-materials>Genshin Impact Nilou Talent materials<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-nilou-talent-materials>#</a></h2><p>To get the most out of using Nilou, you will have to level her skills up by using Talent materials, which vary from character-to-character.
For Nilou, you&rsquo;ll need to farm a lot of Praxis and Crystalline Cyst Dust materials (if you don&rsquo;t already have them) to fully upgrade her capabilities.
As Nilou has three Talents, you will have to spend three times the Talent materials listed below to fully upgrade all of her abilities, which we&rsquo;ve also detailed below the table.
Here&rsquo;s what Nilou Talent materials and Mora you need to improve one of her abilities:
Here&rsquo;s what Talent Materials you&rsquo;ll need to fully upgrade one of Nilou&rsquo;s skills:</p><p>x1 Crown of Insight x3 Teachings of Praxis x6 Fungal Spores x6 Tears of the Calamitous God x21 Guide to Praxis x22 Luminescent Pollen x31 Crystalline Cyst Dust x38 Philosophies to Praxis 1,652,500 Mora</p><p>To upgrade all three of Nilou&rsquo;s skills, here&rsquo;s all the Talent Materials you&rsquo;ll need:</p><p>x3 Crown of Insight x9 Teachings of Praxis x18 Fungal Spores x18 Tears of the Calamitous God x63 Guide to Praxis x66 Luminescent Pollen x93 Crystalline Cyst Dust x114 Philosophies to Praxis 4,957,500 Mora</p><h2 id=genshin-impact-nilou-ascension-materials>Genshin Impact Nilou Ascension materials<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-nilou-ascension-materials>#</a></h2><p>Just like Talents, you need to use Nilou Ascension materials to upgrade her health, attack, defence, and critical hit effectiveness.
You&rsquo;ll need to farm a lot of Padisarah and Perpetual Caliber materials for Nilou (if you don&rsquo;t already have them) to fully upgrade her capabilities.
Unlike Talent materials, you only need to spend the below Ascension materials once to fully raise Nilou to her highest character level. There is also Acquaint Fate rewarded for reaching certain Ascension levels. You can spend this Fate on the standard and beginner Banners to Wish for characters and weapons.
Here&rsquo;s what Nilou Ascension materials and Mora you need to upgrade her for each Ascension level:
In total, here&rsquo;s all the Ascension Materials you need for Nilou in Genshin Impact:</p><p>x1 Varunada Lazurite Sliver x6 Varunada Lazurite Gemstone x9 Varunada Lazurite Fragment x9 Varunada Lazurite Chunk x18 Fungal Spores x30 Luminescent Pollen x36 Crystalline Cyst Dust x46 Perpetual Caliber x168 Padisarah 420,000 Mora</p><h2 id=genshin-impact-nilou-constellation>Genshin Impact Nilou Constellation<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-nilou-constellation>#</a></h2><p>By getting duplicates of Nilou from wishing on Banners, you will receive her Stella Fortuna. This material allows you to unlock Constellation levels, with each upgrade either improving an existing Talent or Passive ability.
Here are all of Nilou&rsquo;s Constellation level upgrades in Genshin Impact:</p><p>Dance of the Waning Moon (C1): During Nilou&rsquo;s Elemental Skill, Dance of Haftkarsvar, Luminous Illusion damage is increased by 65%, and Tranquility Aura&rsquo;s duration is extended by six seconds. The Starry Skies Their Flowers Rain (C2): An opponent&rsquo;s Hydro OR Dendro Resistance is decreased by 35% for 10 seconds depending on if a character under the effect of Golden Chalice&rsquo;s Bounty deals Hydro or Dendro damage to that opponent. Beguiling Shadowstep (C3): Increases the level of Dance of Abzendegi: Distant Dreams, Listening Spring by three, with a maximum upgrade level of 15. Fricative Pulse (C4): Nilou gains 15 Elemental Energy and damage from her Elemental Burst is increased by 50% for eight seconds when the third dance step of her Elemental Skill, Haftkarsvar&rsquo;s Pirouette, hits opponents. Funerary Rite: Twirling Light (C5): Increases the level of Dance of Haftkarsvar by three. Frostbreaker&rsquo;s Melody (C6): For every 1,000 HP, Nilou&rsquo;s crit will increase by 0.6% with a maximum increase of 30%, and her crit damage is increased by 1.2% with a maximum increase of 60%.</p><h2 id=how-to-play-nilou-in-genshin-impact>How to play Nilou in Genshin Impact<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-play-nilou-in-genshin-impact>#</a></h2><p>Nilou has a very specific playstyle that requires you to have only Hydro and Dendro characters in your party in order to take full advantage of her talents. While you can insert her into other party types, it should only really be in place of characters you haven&rsquo;t pulled yet, and even then we wouldn&rsquo;t really recommend it unless you&rsquo;re only playing Nilou for her unique dance attacks on field, and not her damage potential with the right party.
The best way to build Nilou is as a sort of hybrid main DPS and sub DPS. This is because you&rsquo;ll need at least one Dendro teammate to apply Dendro to enemies, and then you&rsquo;ll use Nilou to apply Hydro to create a Bloom reaction and produce Dendro Cores. With Nilou&rsquo;s Court of Dancing Petals passive talent, she&rsquo;ll create Bountiful Cores instead of Dendro Cores, which have a greater AOE, and take about a sixth of the time to explode - making them better for DPS potential.
This Golden Chalice’s Bounty effect from Court of Dancing Petals lasts 30 seconds and increases the Elemental Mastery of all teammates for thirty seconds. You&rsquo;ll want to be applying this effect as often as possible, which means you&rsquo;ll need a Hydro or Dendro healer on your team to support the damage you&rsquo;ll be taking from Nilou&rsquo;s Bountiful Cores. This damage is unavoidable in a good Nilou team, as you actually need to take this damage to lower an enemy&rsquo;s resistance to Hydro or Dendro in order to increase your DPS.
To ensure you&rsquo;re lowering an enemy&rsquo;s Hydro or Dendro resistance, keep pressing the Elemental Skill button after you activate it until you see a blue aura around Nilou, as if you use a normal attack as the third input after activating her skill, Nilou will go into a different stance, which won&rsquo;t help you with this particular playstyle.
We also don&rsquo;t recommend using a Nilou team for single enemy encounters, as your team needs to produce two Dendro Cores to maximise damage potential, and only one is achievable at a time with single targets.
In short, spam Nilou&rsquo;s Elemental Skill as often as possible in your rotations, then create a Bloom reaction with at least one Dendro teammate to produce Bountiful Cores, and heal when required, as these cores should be exploding often if you&rsquo;re rotating correctly.</p><h2 id=best-nilou-team-comp-in-genshin-impact>Best Nilou team comp in Genshin Impact<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-nilou-team-comp-in-genshin-impact>#</a></h2><p>It&rsquo;s very important to build a good team with Nilou or you&rsquo;ll produce lacklustre damage and might struggle in important encounters otherwise.
The main thing you need to remember is that you are going to need a team of only Hydro and Dendro when Nilou is on your team to get the most out of her Talents. As there aren&rsquo;t many Dendro characters in the game at the moment, your options are limited in that regard. They&rsquo;ll be used to create Dendro Cores primarily, so we recommend the Dendro Traveler for this, or even Collei, but she has a slightly more difficult application method.
As your team will be taking damage from lots of Nilou&rsquo;s Dendro and Bountiful Cores, you will also need a Dendro or Hydro healer. As there&rsquo;s currently no Dendro healer in the game, it&rsquo;ll have to be a Hydro healer, and the best option for this is Kokomi. As a free-to-play option, you can also slot Barbara into this healer role, but Kokomi is vastly superior, so you should use her in your Nilou team if you have her.
The fourth slot in most teams are usually quite flexible, but as you can only have Hydro or Dendro characters in a good Nilou team, your fourth slot will depend on who you have. That said, we currently recommend a Hydro character, as there are more of them available, and you can produce Bloom reaction quicker with a Hydro character who can apply Wet often, like Xingqiu or even Ayato or Yelan.
Keep in mind that 5-Star Nahida is likely to debut in the 3.2 update, who will be better at applying Dendro support than the Dendro Traveler, or even in the same team as them, based on beta information. As always, we&rsquo;ll have to wait to see if this is accurate when she is officially released, but it&rsquo;s likely Nahida will be required for the best Nilou team in the future.</p><h2 id=best-nilou-artifacts-in-genshin-impact>Best Nilou Artifacts in Genshin Impact<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-nilou-artifacts-in-genshin-impact>#</a></h2><p>With at least one Dendro character needed for Nilou&rsquo;s best build and team comp, you should have someone on your team with the four-piece Deepwood Memories. Ideally, this should be on a Dendro character to boost their Dendro damage, but any party member can equip Deepwood Memories to help decrease enemies&rsquo; Dendro resistance and raise your party&rsquo;s DPS potential.
Specifically for Nilou herself, we recommend the two-piece Tenacity of the Millelith for a 20% health increase. The other two-piece is based on what your particular team comp needs. Emblem of Severed Fate has you covered for a 20% Energy Recharge increase, Heart of Depth increases your Hydro damage by 15%, Noblesse Oblige increases Elemental Burst damage by 20% - there&rsquo;s a lot of options here, so go through what you have and pick what seems best for your party.
Lastly, for all Artifacts, you should have HP as your main and sub-stat priority.</p><h2 id=best-nilou-weapon-in-genshin-impact>Best Nilou weapon in Genshin Impact<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-nilou-weapon-in-genshin-impact>#</a></h2><p>As with most signatures, the 5-Star Key of Khaj-Nisut sword sword is Nilou&rsquo;s best weapon in Genshin Impact. Signature weapons are basically custom built for characters, as is the case with the Key of Khaj-Nisut sword and Nilou.
The Key of Khaj-Nisut sword increases Nilou&rsquo;s HP by a massive 66.2%, and increases HP by a further 20% at Refinement Rank 1 (R1), increasing to 40% at R5. As well as this huge health increase (which some of Nilou&rsquo;s attacks scale off of), her Elemental Mastery increases by 0.12% of her Maximum HP at R1 when Nilou activates her Elemental Skill. When it reaches three stacks, or the third stack refreshes, other party members will receive a 0.2% Elemental Mastery increase for 20 seconds at R1, scaled off Nilou&rsquo;s maximum health.<br>If you don&rsquo;t want to spend your Fate on Wishing on character and weapon Banners, however, then you can repurpose other 5-Star swords instead, most notably the Primordial Jade Cutter for its HP increase. However, you might want to consider a sword that gives your more crit or Elemental Mastery, like the Mistsplitter Reforged, as your Artifact sub-stats need to prioritise HP.
As for 4-Star weapon options, the Favonius Sword and Xiphos&rsquo; Moonlight seem to be great options for Nilou if you need Energy Particles for her Burst, or another teammate&rsquo;s Burst.
Genshin Impact version 3.3 is here, with new codes, and new character Scaramouche (Wanderer), so find out where he&rsquo;s placed on our tier list.
You&rsquo;ll need Primogems and luck of the Pity and 50/50 systems to Wish with Fate for him and other current and next banners. You&rsquo;ll also need the right Adventure Rank for events. For more Sumeru help, we&rsquo;ve got pages on Sumeru Reputation, Tree of Dreams, Dendroculus locations, the Aeonblight Drake boss, the Garden of Endless Pillars Domain, and locations for Nilotpala Lotus, Padisarah, Scarabs, and Redcrest.
You can also now unlock the Genius Invokation TCG and, if you want help building your deck, check out our Genius Invokation TCG Card List.
If you want to relax, however, why not try fishing at one of the many fishing spot locations?</p><h2 id=best-nilou-build-in-genshin-impact>Best Nilou build in Genshin Impact<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-nilou-build-in-genshin-impact>#</a></h2><p>If you want to take advantage of her very specific hybrid sub and main DPS capabilities, we have compiled what we think is currently the best Nilou build in Genshin Impact:</p><p>Nilou Best Weapon: 5-Star Key of Khaj-Nisut sword. Nilou Best Artifacts: 2-piece Tenacity of the Millelith and 2-piece Noblesse Oblige. Nilou Best team comp: Kokomi, Dendro Traveler, Xingqiu.</p><p>It&rsquo;s up to you whether the time it takes to farm for Nilou&rsquo;s materials in order to raise her stats is worth it, as she has a very specific playstyle, with an equally specific team comp needed to make her talents work as best they can. Nilou may get even better when more Dendro supports are added in the future, but for now, she does take a lot of work to maintain a good DPS output.
Good luck levelling up Nilou in Genshin Impact!</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Nilou-Genshin-Impact.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Nilou-Genshin-Impact.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact Nilou best build  Talent  Ascension materials  Constellation  team  and weapon -
