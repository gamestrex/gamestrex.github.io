RELATED: 37th Annual Film-Independent Spirit Awards Nominations Dominated by A24, Netflix, and Neon. Julia Stamey: Nick \u0026 I met in 2018, when I was a sophomore and he was a senior in the United Nations-Chapel Hill. We were both media teachers, and worked together for Student Television and the Carolina Film Association, so we knew we could work well on a film. However, the work in the Pacific Spheres of the Nations, which was staged in the film “Papper Players” we got to know the musical world. Since we feared that the future of our new friends from Rocky was a perfect opportunity to collaborate on the filmmaking medium, but then we discovered that our secret musical film category popped up, and we were eager to bring the talent of our new friends and fellow members of our new friends from the band Rocky. What did Fix say for you that made you want to change it? I like a challenge. I always wanted to aim high and do outrageous things. Even if I fail my final goal, I’ll still get plenty done at the end of the project. The unique challenge of Musical Film was a real interest to me because I had just started getting involved in theatre the first year of the senior year in the UC, so I found it convenient and exciting to see these new art modes through the movie medium that I had already enjoyed. Julia: So much fun as Nick said. Our two bad habits are of naiveness of trying to avoid a challenge. That felt like a perfect shoot for the moon project that would combine all of us interests. How was Fix’s most difficult aspect, and how did you manage that? Nicholas: One of the most difficult problems of Fix was having to do so many different parts of production on our own. Although we were fortunate to work with Chris Stamey as our sound engineer, our team of 40 students had hardly any professional experience, so we were able to learn many things on the fly, often when we were working 3-4 roles in our movie set. At a time, I was acting as a camera, light a scene, and walking around the background of the shot. Even though that seems to be very traumatic, I will appreciate the experience, since I can now pick up a lot of skills I know I not normally feel like I’m not interested in, and this new toolkit lets me work in a producer’s work. Julia: For me personally, although many films are coming out this year, COVID was a big challenge. The score was not yet set at right – the country had been shut down by a time when the shooter had already finished in May. I was able to see some very talented musicians, such as Charles Cleaver, Dan Davis and Matt Douglas, in order to record a recording from home or to come in the studio to make ends meet a beautiful soundtrack that I am very proud of. Have you ever heard of a lot of fun stories about the re-imagines of Fix? Nicholas: During the period of pre-production for Fix, our writers were able to adapt Matthew’s script, so our production team raised funds for equipment and various other expenses. We managed a successful Kickstarter for our friends and family, but we didn’t even think it would be a great idea to do a bake sale for a weekend. It would be very cold, but selling brownies and cookies to the swarms of college kids walking around Franklin St. and helping everyone who was listening to us was a memorable experience. So we raised a decent sum to help us buy some of the equipment. Julia: For a long time, the song In A Heartbeat rained and I couldn’t find out what the score was missing. Dan Davis was set to play the drums on the track, and it was a little helping, but at one moment, Chris, our recording engineer, pulled me aside and said I’ve got a idea, can I try this? I told her sure, and turned to Dan and said, imagine you were a little goblin laughing at the character and laughing at him when he was arguing over their fight. Dan \u0026 I started laughing because I had a ridiculous direction, and he, even when Dan gave us his best interpretive goblin laugh on the drums, the song worked like magic. I never will follow his way to Chris again. Is the Unforgivable interview Sandra Bullock \u0026 Rob Morgan talking about Netflix drama? What were the things that you learned about Fix that you were excited to apply to future projects? According to Nicholas, The Fix was my first feature-length project. It’s like the list of things that I learned long enough. By wearing a hat in multiples, I became a better producer because I couldn’t imagine all the different puzzle pieces coming together and also had the importance of not procrastinating. The extra feature of planning everything around the calendars of more than 40 students was an individual obstacle, but the production team took in stride to get the task done and managed with late-night shooting and the crews. Julia: Is it wrong to say everything? Filmmaking, as well as the most skilled artistic ability, is one of those things that you can study, but not even without practice. Working on Fix and trying to apply what I learned in the Communiocation Dept. was very fun, but I can’t wait to apply to our next project.\n","wordCount":"1041","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-16T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-16T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Charles Minor"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/interview-nicholas-bafia-and-julia-stamey-talk-about-the-musical-fix/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Interview Nicholas Bafia And Julia Stamey Talk About The Musical Fix</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-16 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 16, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1041 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Charles Minor</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>Fixfeatures eleven original songs, all recorded and produced by North Carolina indie rock legend Chris Stamey at Modern Recording.

What brought you to the Bafia-Stamey production?
As it turns out the musical movie category of the Academy Awards was long overdue, we took it as a challenge. The goal was to build upon our friends and resources from the Film, TV and Theatre sector at UNC to make an original musical film and try to win one of the biggest entertainment awards while operating in a fun niche.
