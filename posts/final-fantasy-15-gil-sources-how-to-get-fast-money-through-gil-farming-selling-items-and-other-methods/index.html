Thankfully, there’s a number of reliable sources of income that you can always rely on to help you throughout the adventure. Once you’re done, you might also be interesting ways to get fast EXP and fast AP, too. Sell Treasures - Money doesn’t grow on trees, but it does lie around on the ground. As you explore you’ll find all kinds of random odds and ends scattered. Some of them will be useful, but a great deal of the stuff you find is of no practical benefit to you and can be sold to any merchant around the world (or even remotely via the Regalia). Common items such as scraps of rusty metal will net you a handful of Gil, but some can be worth several thousand so it’s worth keeping your eyes peeled and rummaging off the beaten path while you explore. Fishing and also picking up ingredients in the wild can also be sold easily. There are some treasures you need for certain side-quests - such as Cid’s weapon upgrades - but these are few and far between and most importantly, aren’t missable - so you can always head off and collect more fairly easily. As you upgrade your equipment, find better accessories, and generally get more tooled up don’t forget to sell off any unused items too - that bracelet that was such a bonus back when you first started will be pretty much junk later on, so when something has outlived its usefulness just get rid of it. Monster drops - On a similar note, monsters will give out random loot when they’re killed, and by upgrading Gladio’s survival skills the frequency and value of the drops can be increased. Sometimes they’ll drop something you can sell, other times they’ll drop something that saves you from having to buy one, but either way the overall effect is more money in your pocket. Side quests - Most side-quests give you some Gil for participation, but as with EXP, some are more lucative than others. Here’s some of the more profitable questlines:\nHolly’s questline (from Chapter 8 in Lestallum) is pretty straightforward and offers good rewards - with three missions handing out 2500, 5000 and 10,000 Gil rewards a pop. Broken down cars (throughout the world) often handout four digit rewards. Keep an eye out for any on the roadside, and make sure you carry some Repair Kits (sold at Hammerhead) to help. Monster rescues (throughout the world), as above, also handout four digit rewards and are worth looking out for whenever you explore on foot. Keep a stock of potions and other consumables at hand so you can complete these quests. Vyv photo quest missions (which begin in Lestallum and before you have to leave for the Tomb in Chapter 3) are pretty lucrative, with four to five figure Gil rewards per completed quest. Get every Scraps of Mystery map piece and you can sell the Mythril Ingot treasure for 20,000 Gil. Taking down Adamantoise nets you a cool 50,000 EXP and 50,000 Gil as a reward for the marathon battle.\nTotomostro - When you reach Altissia, you can go to a colosseum where you get medals on monster battles. Medals cost 10 Gil a pop, and by winning and raising the numbers of Medals you earn, you can trade 2,500 Medals for one Great Garula Tusk, which can sell for 1,700 Gil - a pretty decent return at high numbers. If you’re serious about the mini-game, then invest in a Horn so you can boost your team’s stats to help them win. Need more help? Our Final Fantasy 15 guide and walkthrough can provide tips on main story, as well as the open-world’s many quests and activities. Learning how to get AP fast, EXP fast and money or Gil fast will aid you in many optional dungeons and tombs - including how to open and explore their locked doors. There’s also plenty of interesting side-quests, too, such as the Scraps of Mystery and Professors Protege frog locations. And if you want to get around easier, you can rent a Chocobo, learn the infinite sprint trick and later in the game, get the flying car Regalia Type F. There’s also more to see and do with DLC, such as Episode Gladiolus and Episode Prompto. As mentioned above, increasing your Survival skill can increase the number of drop rates. While it’s perhaps slower than Totomostro betting, you also get a load of AP while at it (and do it earlier in the game) which is arguably much harder to come by.
