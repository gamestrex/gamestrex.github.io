Since the return of offline competition, Project+ has seen a new guard of elite players rise to the top. Kevin The Doctor Ascate won his first major victory in Undertow by Mario. Similarly, Kyle Kycse Carrero used Charizard to win his first major at Shipwrecked. Now, Michael techboy Leleniewski became a member of their ranks, piloting the Ice Climbers to his biggest tournament victory on Blacklisted six. In his last four qualifying match, techboy was defeated 3-2 by Cory The Ivy Player M., a Kirby player who had knocked out Kyle Switch Carlon in pools. Notably, the five-game face-off ended up being techboys closest set until grand finals. He beat Kevin Blue Rosas Hope 3-1 to qualify for top-earth top-eight on the winners side. In the semis, techboy gained a convincing 3-0 victory over Malachi Malachi Covington, the no. 1 player in the PMRank 2019. Lastly, he battled Undertow champion The Doctor – both in the winners final and grand final. After the success of the Ice Climbers, the Doctor was no match for techboys. He defeated him 3-1 in finals and 3-2 in grand finals. Three months, three majors, three new national champions. What time to play when the pm is here? Sabre (@Sabre_Metrics) November 8, 2021\nThe doctor proved to be a consistent threat. Although he’s the first to take Blacklisted six, the Doctor technique underperformed by finishing in second place. Whatever his performance he showed, he wasn’t just as good he could. As the tides of high-level Project+ change, it is only possible to remain consistent from tournament to tournament. There seems to be a doctor doing that. The Doctors run through winners saw him defeat Spencer Mr. Watch\u0026Learn McLaughlin 3-0, Anna Kumatora Mayorskiy 3-1, Nick Stango-3-2 and Brian-Godley-Sibelius 3–1. He eliminated 3-1 with the third in the losers final while only losing to the championship champion, techboy. The doctor has long been established as the best Project+ Mario, thus rocking the Dr. Mario’s skin as he has it said it is, as should the name. The California native can give confirmation that he is one of the best Project+ players period at Jailbreak, a shadow major running along Mainstage 2021. Have just finished qualifying for this! I was very excited to go to the first invitation to visit me. This is so great for P+! https://t.co.mp4ySekKjp https://t.co.edu/. Kevin Ascate (The Doctor) (@The Doctor) November 8, 2021.\nTwisty pilots Wario through a deep loss run. Will Twisty Gomez has emerged with consistently strong performances this season, putting in the top 12 of every Project+ major this year. Since Twisty suffered an upset defeat to Brennan Bongo Avery in pools, maintaining a streak at Blacklisted 6 proved difficult to maintain. Yet, the Wario main walked through the losers bracket to place five, matched his placement at Undertow. Twisty made up the top 24 of the ‘Phresh Williams’, eliminating 3-3 in the case of Messiah and 3-5 in the case of Mike guttey Pettit. He ran back to the ground with the victory against Yono, a Knuckles major who ran to fifth at Undertow and also placed fifth. After defeating Nick Boiko 3-1, Twisty hunkered Blue in a top-op-eight qualifier match. They had already met at the same place in bracket at Shipwrecked, where Blue beat Twisty 3-0 to finish his run in ninth place. Twisty reversed that storyline at Blacklisted, defeating Blue with three wins in top eight. From there, Twisty won a five-game set against Ivan Ivayne Castaneda before gaining a second five-game set to dvd. Top 8 is happening NOW! Feat.

He ran back to the ground with the victory against Yono, a Knuckles major who ran to fifth at Undertow and also placed fifth. After defeating Nick Boiko 3-1, Twisty hunkered Blue in a top-op-eight qualifier match.
They had already met at the same place in bracket at Shipwrecked, where Blue beat Twisty 3-0 to finish his run in ninth place. Twisty reversed that storyline at Blacklisted, defeating Blue with three wins in top eight. From there, Twisty won a five-game set against Ivan Ivayne Castaneda before gaining a second five-game set to dvd.
