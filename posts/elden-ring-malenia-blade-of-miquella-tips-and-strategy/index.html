While you should ideally be dodging her attacks, having a high guard boost and stamina gauge means you’ll withstand the first part of her fatal flurry combo that will normally kill you.\rIt will also help to have armour or items that give you high resistance to scarlet rot during her second phase. Oh yes, there’s a second phase.\nHow to defeat Malenia, Blade of Miquella While she can be a very agile opponent, Malenia approaches you at a walking pace to begin with, meaning you have plenty of time to summon a spirit, neck a potion like a Flask of Wondrous Physick before you properly clash.\rMalenia attacks with slashes and thrusts from her blade, and the real kicker is her attacks recover her health with each hit, even if you’re blocking. This is a particular downside to bringing allies with you since this potentially means more opportunities for her health bar to stay topped up, so coordination is paramount.\rHer frightening attack power is balanced by the fact that she has low poise so her attacks can easily be interrupted, though you preferably want to stagger her before she even begins her attack animation.\rPlayers with an ally should try to flank her and coordinate attack timings to prevent her from having any breathing room.\rSuccessive attacks (such as two combos of the Bloodhound’s Fang’s unique skill and follow-up) will knock her down and open for a critical attack, although she’s quite nimble and can easily pirouette out of your range.\rHer attacks can also be parried, but be warned it takes three successive parries to stun her for a riposte, so this tactic isn’t recommended unless you’re incredibly confident with your parry timings.\rA few attacks that you need to watch out for, one is her charged thrust that has a huge range but which takes a couple seconds to charge so you can usually anticipate this and dodge roll under it.\rThe other is a grapple which has a much smaller window to react as she pulls her arm back before reaching out to grab you.\rIf caught, she’ll throw you up in the air then impale you on her sword, which will in all likelihood kill you right away. A high-level spirit caught in this attack will however survive it.\rThe most deadly attack Malenia has occurs once you’ve taken her health below 75%. She will leap in the air, hold for about a second and then home in on you with a vicious flurry of attacks that deal enough damage to kill you.\rAnd if it doesn’t, then she follows up with a second flurry, and then a third, which finishes with a small stationary AOE flurry.

Malenia attacks with slashes and thrusts from her blade, and the real kicker is her attacks recover her health with each hit, even if you’re blocking.
This is a particular downside to bringing allies with you since this potentially means more opportunities for her health bar to stay topped up, so coordination is paramount.
Her frightening attack power is balanced by the fact that she has low poise so her attacks can easily be interrupted, though you preferably want to stagger her before she even begins her attack animation.
Players with an ally should try to flank her and coordinate attack timings to prevent her from having any breathing room.
Successive attacks (such as two combos of the Bloodhound’s Fang’s unique skill and follow-up) will knock her down and open for a critical attack, although she’s quite nimble and can easily pirouette out of your range.
Her attacks can also be parried, but be warned it takes three successive parries to stun her for a riposte, so this tactic isn’t recommended unless you’re incredibly confident with your parry timings.
A few attacks that you need to watch out for, one is her charged thrust that has a huge range but which takes a couple seconds to charge so you can usually anticipate this and dodge roll under it.

Consider this area radioactive until the petals have dropped down and fade away, as this not only damages your health but also inflicts scarlet rot.
The good news is that Malenia stays still for the whole duration, so ranged or magic users can take this opportunity to unleash their most powerful attacks from a safe distance.
Melee players can still rush in safely at the last moment to get in a couple hits too.
One other new attack to beware of is when Malenia is flying in the air and fires out spirit versions of herself to attack you.
You can lock on to her and dodge the spirits as they come but also look out as she ends this with a swooping attack herself.
She’s also got an attack where she jumps in the air then slams her blade on the ground, followed by a burst of scarlet rot-inducing wind in front of her. This burst happens a little while afterwards, giving you a small window to attack before backing away.
Your best bet is to avoid the worst of these attacks and continue coordinating with your spirit, if they are still alive.
Also make sure you’ve got the maximum number of healing flasks and hope that you didn’t use too many during her first phase.
Because of the heavy damage and potential scarlet rot, you’ll want to keep your health at max at all times.
Once you have settled on a starting class and starting Keepsake item,
you should first work out how to level up, how to respec and use Ashes of War.

Congratulations on overcoming Elden Ring’s greatest challenge!</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/elden-ring-malenia-cover.png/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/elden-ring-malenia-cover.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Elden Ring Malenia  Blade of Miquella tips and strategy - 22"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/elden-ring-malenia-2.png/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/elden-ring-malenia-2.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Elden Ring Malenia  Blade of Miquella tips and strategy - 32"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/elden-ring-malenia-3.png/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/elden-ring-malenia-3.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Elden Ring Malenia  Blade of Miquella tips and strategy - 89"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/elden-ring-malenia-4.png/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/elden-ring-malenia-4.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Elden Ring Malenia  Blade of Miquella tips and strategy - 2"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/elden-ring-malenia-5.png/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/elden-ring-malenia-5.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Elden Ring Malenia  Blade of Miquella tips and strategy - 10"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/elden-ring-malenia-6.png/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/elden-ring-malenia-6.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Elden Ring Malenia  Blade of Miquella tips and strategy - 93"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/elden-ring-malenia-7.png/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/elden-ring-malenia-7.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Elden Ring Malenia  Blade of Miquella tips and strategy - 38"></p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/elden-ring-golden-seed-locations/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Elden Ring Golden Seed Locations</span></a>
