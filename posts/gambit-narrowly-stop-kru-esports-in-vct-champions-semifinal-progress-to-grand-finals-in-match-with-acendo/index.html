VALORANT Champions Tour (@ValorantEsports) December 11, 2021. Gambit got back on track despite nearly throwing away a 5v1 advantage during their defensive pistol round and tied the map back up at 8-8 before the first full buy. The first buy round was a smooth one for Gambit, with some Ogun shots from d3ffo as a boost to the Masters Berlin champs’ defense. The Chronicle and the d3ffo continued to hit huge shots to take most of KRU off the sites and play when needed, carrying a flawless defensive half to finish his victory on Breeze.

With only their own map pick, KRU sorted through the enemy with a chance of hitting the A site, the two duelists against Gambits zero duelist comp. KRUs Reyna/Jett combo ran by keznit and NagZ opened up a few rounds just because of the opening frags generated, even against sound Gambit defensive setups. The men were seven o’clock at halftime. Gambit struggled to get onto sites without due list, using Skyes flashes and arrows to try and get on its site. But when those abilities failed or that agent finally fell, Gambit had to dive into sites without utility and end up getting lost by the waiting KRU defenders. KRU won six straight round on defense to turn 13-7. That is twelve for @KRUesports. #VALORANTChampions pic.twitter.com/KFfPWTNSl8. Champions Tour (@ValorantEsports) December 11, 2021. KRU jumped out of town for the third straight map. It helped Gambit to become a more difficult worker because of the rapid trade. Gambit had a few knock-side rounds, but a Brimstone ult from Delz1k in the final half capped off a 8-4 lead for KRU, before transferring sides. KRU won a powerful pistol round to start their attack side, continuing their lead thanks to their ability to retake the Gambits defense with utility. Gambit finally built momentum on defense, bringing KRU’s six-round lead into a one-round lead, before a hacked spam on the B site made it 11-9, thus becoming the first to try on Gambit. KRU responded to a Chronicle ace by pushing, according to an agressive, Raze-led thrifty B push to reach match point at 12-10. Only nAts could hit back with a massive 4K from behind his Viper wall. Just Spectres, KRU couldn’t find the kills needed to close out, leaving the map to overtime. [email protected] – THE ACE! #VALORANTChampions pic.twitter.com/TOUQQYK74F#Pagebook-Hex.

Gambit fought its best OT round in order to start the fourth period, resulting in flawless application of the A site with all the power and timed peeks. KRU returned fire with a powerful A execute, reverting to some key missed shots from Gambit and going to a fifth overtime. Gambit took another lead after another attack round and closed out the map with a Chronicle lurking and another naAts hold, 18-16.
