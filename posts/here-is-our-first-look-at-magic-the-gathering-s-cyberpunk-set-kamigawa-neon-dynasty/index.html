The teaser has been posted by WeeklyMTG, followed by an informative blog post, but now it’s open-air, which will be announced late January. We didn’t show new mechanics. But there was another glance at the new Planeswalker, the cyborg ninja Kaito Shizuki, and the other few other Ninjas to the set.\nPlaneswalker: Kaito Shizuki, kiyama and yyakuja. Kaito is a dimir (blue/black) Planeswalker. He is a clever, intuitive robot and can make non-introduction-earthed creatures and even cheat blue/black creatures directly from the battlefield. He has phasing, a rare and often-used mechanic last seen in Objects in the Forgotten Realms, that lets Kaito feel more evasive than normal planeswalkers. If you like to learn more about Kaito, Wizards has already released a short story on his emergence as a Planeswalker. This story introduces us to this old-fashioned Kamigawa. The story is entirely based on the historical figures from the Neon Dynasty to the end of the season. From the 11 et 21 of January a series of stories will be released for the 1200 years between the original Kamigawa set and the Neon Dynasty, followed by the set’s official story on the 24-26 of January. There was confirmation that The Wanderer will appear in the set, as she appears at the end of the incredible teaser trailer. The Wanderer has been a mysterious figure in Magic’s lore since she appeared in War of the Spark, but we’ll finally get answers to what she really is in Neon Dynasty.\nFull art aiko-e Lands. A particularly interesting reveal was that Neon Dynasty will have showcased full-art lands inspired by Japanese Ukiyo-e paintings. Each of the five basic lands is made up of two different art types, and available in draft, set and collector’s boosters. In the pack of the draft and set boosters, Ukiyo-e lands will appear in about one third of packs, while in the collection of boosters one will always be guaranteed. There will also be basic land, which will be available in the remainder of draft and set packs as well as in the booster bundle box. The Ukiyo-e lands represent the primary conflict of Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty, the conflict between modern and tradition. Only half of the sets will focus on futuristic cyberpunk aesthetics, while the other half will return to the more traditional, historical Kamigawa you know from the older sets.\nNew, attractive, and dark-looking structures: Ninja, Soft Glow and Hidden Neons. Neon Dynasty will have very different set-ups, such as an ultra-rare, found only in one percent of collector’s boosters. First is the Ninja frame, which will presumably be used for the many Ninjas of Neon Dynasty in the same way as the Fang frame used to the vampires of Innistrad: Crimson Vow. The only one we’ve seen at this time is for Kaito Shizuki, but it is rich in angles and metal plating in an effort to draw attention to an armour of a Ninja. The second part of the screen is a hard-y, soft groan. Although the type of cards that will appear on were confirmed, the frame is surrounded by a neon glow and a futuristic form. The third kind announces is ‘Hidden Neon’; it’s unique for showcase frames, and in that it will only be available on a single card. Hidetsugu, Devouring Chaos. Hidetsugu was a popular character of the original Kamigawa sets and is returning to the country here as a Full-On Ogre Demon. To celebrate, there will be four different Hidden Neon versions available on the display, which, according to the official media report, are printed using a new technique to make it look like the card is actually glowing with neon. The blue, green and red shades for Hidden Neons are only available in one percent of Collector’s boosters. Yellow is the fourth colour of the game, and it is due as a promo card in the partnered WPN Premium stores. Wizards confirmed that there is also a fourth type that’ll be made available. It is implied that this will feature Japanese artists’ art; it will be announced later by the Japanese Magic the Gathering team. It is worth noting that the cards of this style are not yet made up of by Japanese artists, such as the alternative art for Atsushi, the Blazing Sky (seen below) that was illustrated by the renowned Duel Masters artist Toshiaki Takayama.\nLegendary Dragons The five dragon guardians of the plane are returning in Neon Dynasty, although none of them died during the original Kamigawa block story. One was found, the red Atsushi, a blue sky, which is a beautiful gift or a special prize when it died. The 5 dragons will form a cycle, with one colour for each colour, but they aren’t the only creatures of the planet that exist in the set. We’re excited to see Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty, as confirmed by the stream, the set has the Legends theme and, accordingly, has the most “real” number of Legendary creatures for a premiere (Standard-legal) set.\nMore to come. Today’s stream was only a sneak peek of what will come, with the full reveal taking place on January 27. We’ll hear more about the two Commander decks that set holds. It won’t be the second time we hear about Kamigawa in general, though. On January 11, there will be a “Creative Roundtable”, where creatives of the set will probably discuss the process behind making Neon Dynasty, and how it got such a striking art style. Kamigawa: The Neon Dynasty will begin on February 17 as tabletop games and a day earlier as digital games are broadcast through Arena and Magic the Gathering.\n","wordCount":"989","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-04T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Naomi Landry"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/here-is-our-first-look-at-magic-the-gathering-s-cyberpunk-set-kamigawa-neon-dynasty/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Here Is Our First Look At Magic The Gathering S Cyberpunk Set Kamigawa Neon Dynasty</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 4, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;989 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Naomi Landry</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#planeswalker-kaito-shizuki-kiyama-and-yyakuja>Planeswalker: Kaito Shizuki, kiyama and yyakuja.</a></li><li><a href=#full-art-aiko-e-lands>Full art aiko-e Lands.</a></li><li><a href=#new-attractive-and-dark-looking-structures-ninja-soft-glow-and-hidden-neons>New, attractive, and dark-looking structures: Ninja, Soft Glow and Hidden Neons.</a></li><li><a href=#legendary-dragons>Legendary Dragons</a></li><li><a href=#more-to-come>More to come.</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty is set in an inspired Japanese plane, 1200 years since our last encounter in the early ’00s Kamigawa building.
