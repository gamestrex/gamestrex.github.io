However, the 2021 League of Legends World Championship was the most popular esport in November. In recorded a ten-minute peak viewership of over 4m, the tournament is second highest ever in 2021, except for Chinese viewers. According to Esports Charts, the World Championship was the highest peak viewership, average viewership and most hours watched in the world event. In addition, World 2021 was only the seventh esports tournament in history to have an average viewership of more than 1 million spectators. The success of a League of Legends, as well as the VALORANT Champions 2021 recording a high audience of over 1m, shows how a strong year for Riot Games has brought to the attention of the industry. Copyright: Esports Charts.\nBLAST and PGL secure a great finish. The two events achieved in November by CS:GO and major Stokholm 2021 – a final in the British Premiers’ Fall 2021 finale – with both events gaining top-five place in the Esports Charts table. First, the biggest CS:GO event ever received 274 viewers. A previous record of 1.33m with the MTL was real amassed during four separate match throughout the event. PGL also recorded a Russian audience of more than 1m peak viewers. What’s more impressive is that only six CS:GO tournaments have ever experienced a total peak viewership of one million or more. Credit: Sports Charts. Whilst PGL got the attention, the figures of the BLAST Premiers will not be ignored. According to Esports Charts, the tournament recorded a maximum viewership of 861,383 and generated 17m hours per night, which is the highest total for every BLAST CS:GO event. The shooter finished the competition earlier this month, with its final season of the season XVI and Winter at the peak time of 308,457 viewers, what was recorded during the quarterfinal match between Gambit and Vitality.\nMobile sports remain a leading concern among users. Following the third and fourth page finish in the January 2012 edition of the Esports Charts, the Mobile Legends is finished in the year 2006 edition with a “fooll”, a Free Fire and a Bang Band before the first announcement, the new year was coming to its end in December. ONE Esports MPL Invitational recorded a high viewing rate of 1.73, making Mobile Legends the sixth most popular tournament. In comparison to the first event of the invitational ceremony last year, he saw an increase in audience volume. This means more than double the events average viewership (12142,038, 341,464) and increasing the number of guest viewers by over 1m. A copy of the esports chart includes an Esports diagram. Garanas decided to cancel the second 2021 Free Fire World Series event in August, but instead host regional tournaments. One of the most popular was the Free Fire Asia Championship in 2021. At the same time, a maximum viewership exceeded 1,08m. The Open Fire tournament was named the seventh most popular tournament in terms of viewership. In the first half of the South Asian Championships, participants saw a larger viewership, but in the second half, the Asian Championships, the two Xvii edots made a difference. According to the Sports Charts, the India Championship recorded a sleeve in Hindi with an average of 984,000. That’s 80 percent more than Asia Championship. Reporting on competition in all competitions was compared to the Esport Charts October 2021.\nEsports can keep momentum going in December. However, the years have passed since the 2015 deadline, and many other esports competitions have still occurred this month. Moreover, the teams in Mobile Legends and Gold Arena currently compete in the respective titles. Up to 2,6 million viewers currently attend the M3 World Championship. This means the title still has a lot of work to do if it wants to beat the previous record of 3m which was achieved at the M2 Championship in January. Nevertheless, since finals often attract highest audience figures, the mobile title could certainly reach its record again.
