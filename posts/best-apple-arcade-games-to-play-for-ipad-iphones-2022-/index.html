Capturing our hearts with their visuals and our minds with the actions on the beat, we can’t help but pine for The Fool as she fights the Cursed Arcana, all while gaining each of their hearts. The synthpop OST and constantly changing vaporwave visuals have a way of keeping you hooked for hours on end. The game is an obvious first choice and it is no mistake if it comes off as a personal favorite.\nSneaky Sasquatch Genre: Stealth-lite\nThere’s a good reason we humans are afraid of Sasquatches but here we are, encouraging our Sasquatch friend to steal camper’s food and other resources that they probably need to enjoy their own holidays in the woods. The animation in this game is absolutely adorable and is sure to make you chuckle as you hide from the mean ranger and other (scared) campers in disguises or good old bushes and inside porta potties that get you as far away from your designated station in the park as possible.\nAssemble With Care Genre: Puzzle Video Game\nA slow, story based game that makes almost anything fun and easy to do. Tune out the world and dive in with Maria on her journey around town, as she uncovers the stories each restored object has. Overcoming her own familial problems as she helps out others with their own, this game sure doesn’t look to just help you with your own surface tension. Maybe healing personal trauma is what we’re all looking for with free game therapy.\nNeo Cabs Genre: Indie RPG\nIn a near future for us with automated cabs soon becoming a reality, Lina, one of the only human drivers goes around Los Ojos as she picks up new customers and looks for her missing friend. You may not be able to rewind and undo an action but that definitely lends to making the experience that much more unique and realistic as every decision you take matters. A visual novel that puts gameplay in the backseat, Neo Cabs emphasizes the characters and their stories. Escape to the future while on your way home from work or as you take a break from the mundane reality that we currently live in and help Lina find her friend in this dark, dystopian world.\nGrindstone Genre: Puzzle Video Game\nGetting grindstones and killing creeps, jerks and bosses on the way as he scales Grindstone Mountain, George is in the midst of danger constantly. But you gotta do what you gotta do to bring the bacon home. At least he does. Taking the mundane colour matching game to another level with guts and glory, here is a game that is much more rewarding as the story continues. The grindstones that you collect are not only rewards themselves but also prove to be as fruitful as they are dangerous when they land on the board. Be careful out there as you grind your way to the top.\nOceanhorn 2 Genre: Adventure\nWhile learning the controls initially may be a bit difficult, once you get a grip on these bad boys, Oceanhorn is as close as we’re going to get to playing Breath of the Wild on an Apple device. There is no one that won’t admit that Oceanhorn and its successor Oceanhorn 2 are rip offs of the Legend of Zelda but hey, you know what they say- imitation is the greatest form of flattery. The game itself is enjoyable and interesting with a cute art style and soundtrack to keep you company as you fight off monsters and foes.\nUltimate Rivals: The Court Genre: sports arcade game\nEver wondered how your favourite athletes would play sports that they really have 0 inclination towards? Well here on the court of Ultimate Rivals, you get to do exactly that. Use the best athletes in dozens of sports come to the basketball court and slam dunk each other to shreds. Winning may be your goal but making Wayne Gretzky annihilate the opposition is mine. We are not the same.\nDisney Melee Mania Genre: Action game\nNot a sports fan but very interested in seeing your childhood icons beat each other up? The Disney Melee Mania game does not disappoint as you play any of the Pixar superstars, Disney princesses, villains of your choice and so much more come together and fight to the death. It may not be a fight to the death but a definite fight for your life is ensured as you try your best to win the trophy and level up with mini prizes along the way.\nWhat The Golf? Genre: Simulation Game\nWeird is an understatement for what this game is. Aiming for holes that move only after you swing, pushing footballs in between goal posts, hurling the human beings golfing into the hole or even swinging right into space. This is a game that really tests the meaning of ‘What really is Golf?’ and everything in between. And yet, it is the perfect game to play when you’re looking to relax and just pass your time. Reminiscent of games like ‘Dumb Ways to Die’, ‘What the Golf?’ has a similar animation style and feel without the gross (although enjoyable) deaths in between.\nCrossy Road Castle Genre: Platform Game\nWe all enjoyed Crossy Road so much that it comes as no surprise that Crossy Road Castle would also be a hit. And for good reason as well. Instead of the endless roads and wilderness, we now have a loooonggg and extremely fun castle to get through. Jumping on opponents, going up on rainbows and whatnot, all while collecting coins and avoiding death. Seems easy enough, right? I guess that there is only one question to ask yourself before you play: Why did the chicken cross the castle? That’s it from us, folks. These are the best Apple Arcade games to play that are guaranteed to just be fun for everyone. With some more challenging and others just bizarre, each one has something for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates and news on what’s good and what’s great in Apple Arcade Games. Until then, keep exploring Games Adda.\n","wordCount":"1054","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Karen Ellis"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/best-apple-arcade-games-to-play-for-ipad-iphones-2022-/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Best Apple Arcade Games To Play For Ipad Iphones 2022</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-27 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 27, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1054 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Karen Ellis</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#best-apple-arcade-games-to-try-out-in-2022>Best Apple Arcade Games To Try Out In 2022</a><ul><li><a href=#sayonara-wild-hearts>Sayonara Wild Hearts</a></li><li><a href=#sneaky-sasquatch>Sneaky Sasquatch</a></li><li><a href=#assemble-with-care>Assemble With Care</a></li><li><a href=#neo-cabs>Neo Cabs</a></li><li><a href=#grindstone>Grindstone</a></li><li><a href=#oceanhorn-2>Oceanhorn 2</a></li><li><a href=#ultimate-rivals-the-court>Ultimate Rivals: The Court</a></li><li><a href=#disney-melee-mania>Disney Melee Mania</a></li><li><a href=#what-the-golf>What The Golf?</a></li><li><a href=#crossy-road-castle>Crossy Road Castle</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h2 id=best-apple-arcade-games-to-try-out-in-2022>Best Apple Arcade Games To Try Out In 2022<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-apple-arcade-games-to-try-out-in-2022>#</a></h2><h3 id=sayonara-wild-hearts>Sayonara Wild Hearts<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sayonara-wild-hearts>#</a></h3><p>Genre: Rhythm action</p><p>There is no rhythm-based game that will ever be as mesmerizing or as daunting as ‘Sayonara Wild Hearts’.
