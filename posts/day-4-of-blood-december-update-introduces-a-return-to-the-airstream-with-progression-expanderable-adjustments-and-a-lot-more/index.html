A new time-limited supply line was added, and a new card type and new cards were added. A new addition is the holiday season event, which adds festive decorations to the Fore Hope and Firing Range, and unlockable cosmetics like character and weapon skins, emblems and sprays. This update is making a lot of alterations to the difficulty of playing. Turtle Rock’s previously admitted thatBack 4 Bloodhad proved to be much more difficult than its intended target, and with this new update, the developer’s is looking for a reduction in the disparity between difficulties, and making it more difficult for them so that it’s not as drastic as a jump from Recruit to Veteran to Nightmare. These include: buffs, debuffs, spawning adjustments, AI changes and much more. You can try to watch some of the more detailed notes below, or use here the full list. Back 4 Blood is available on Xbox, X/S, Xbox, and PC. Specialize with the public if necessary. NEW EATURES:\nWith Progression, campaign offline with a course of action. New Supply Lines: Revolving Merchants. This track was added to the calendar so that players could get up to 4 times to spend on supply points. New cards are Burn Cards. The new card type is available through the Roving Merchant Supply Lines. This card type can be played in every room of the Saferoom to increase the effectiveness of instant healing, currency boosts and increased resistances. Holidays Seasonal celebration. Holiday decorations were added to Fort Hope and the Firing Range. There’s a variety of natural colors: pumpkin, rose, carrots and ashburne. New (non-burn) cards are available. Belt clipIncrease Quickslot inventory by 12 cents. Reduce Quickslot Inventory by -2 % from – 10% from Damage Dealt. ToolheadsHow do teams prepare quickslots by 1? Ridden practice area put into Fort Hope. As an in-law, use play as a rigden in Fort Hope, to practise fighting and exploring mutant abilities. The bots that accompany the player in Solo Campaign are randomized to the same size as the bots. Ultrawide improvements Statistics are now available in Training. A notable bug fix:Attestable to the ability of players to record offensive utility objects. Fixable bug:Fixed an exploit that allowed players to select duplicates instead of one card.\nCAMPAIGN: Balance updating: Difficulty:\nDeveloper Note: This patch is to reduce the complexity of several difficulties, so it’s impossible to jump from Recruit to Veteran to Nightmare. Recruit: The player’s base damage resistance increased to 25 cents (was 20%). The additional currency bonuses increased to 300 (seven hundred), at 250 points. Continue Heal is being raised to 75 (was 25). Get the extra-sufficiency for repeat trauma cures to 25 (was 20). Veteran: The fire value was reduced by a standard-fire mode measure. Sleepers don’t call hordes anymore. The game’s base damage reached 100 o’clock (half the cost). The player base level of health increased to 115 (100%). Added 120 % more capacity with Player Base. A trauma-induced death in a safe room is healed by the therapy. The bonus paid for by continuing currency increased to 200 (was 150) and passed by by all. It was 15 years to keep up with the bonus. The free use of First Aid increases to two (was 1). Nightmare: Characterized friendly fire values. First aid cabinet free use increased to 1 (heavy) (in a range of 0). Special damage to the fawns reduced by 35 o’clock (was 75%). The common damage has been reduced by 50 % (is 100 %). Outdated trauma from incap reduced to 5 (was 10) pounds. Reduce nightmares resist on nightmares 25% (was 40%) a tiff. Attenuation reduced SpecialRidden health buffs to 75% (was 15%). Money saving increased to 100 (was 0). A maximum of ten dollars is expected to be made in future. The bonus for trauma treatment increased to 5 (0). Keep Card draw bonus was increased to 1 (the first is 0), a rate that was used to draw to a 0 (all three). Ammo bonus on a continue up to 15% (was 0). Extra incap trauma has risen to seven (six-six-six percent) during childhood. Spawnings Updates:\nIf the Hordes can be shortened, all the Hordes Special Ridden may be cut by two different sizes, or from one to another. The maximum number of people who have a specific body or animal are shortened, or they are replaced by the usual hordes. You’ve got a special squidden drop. Developer Note: This helps avoid a double digit of Special Ridden when multiple hordes are triggered. Timed Hordes made it impossible for a longer minimum resume time of 60 seconds (was 30,) with exception of custom events. Note: You may trigger a horde in order to a timed horde if the timed horde strikes after the initial horde. Roaming Special Ridden has now 4 (six). Developer Note: Limits the number of special risks when it comes to developing situations. Reduced chance for all Tallboy variants on veteran and nightmare difficults. Foregone 4rd trimester a length of 25 minutes at 60 cm. Wilderly Special Ridden raised minimum spawn distance to tenm (was 5m)\nRidden AI Update:\nWhen a lighted Ridden die, it doesn’t leave them in instant blast. Special Riddens defense against bullet penetration to weak spots has been reduced. Sleepers better link their targets with the sleepers. Tallboy and Bruiser hits are more accurate and their weak spots are better than to hit them. Developer Note: We cleaned the Rolls of the Tallboys to make it easier to hit them. If you have a precise weapon, it should be possible to reach their weak spot from the front. The following changes make your attacks too foggy. Tallboy \u0026 Bruiser His Overhead attack radius reduced to 205 units (was 250). Tallboys have a bad time, so they don’t have a chance to turn during a Burst transit. Reduced Crusher crush attached distance for squeeze attack to 200 units (upgraded to 300 units) Retchs effective range in meters decreased to 22 (was 25), tracking and ramp up time adjusted to work better. Retch will move slightly slower and track the target for slightly longer during vomit attacks (2.25 seconds in 1.6). Retch projectile spray starts at lower speed now (75 % higher than 90 %) and accelerates to maximum velocity for a longer period of time (0,75 oz instead of 0,4 oz) Exploders explosion radius is now visible to the Ridden player. Developer Note: With the following changes, Hockers should not be used as much, are easier to dodge and are not allowed to take as much damage as when an attack landed. The speed of the hocker pin projectile was lowered to two500 (was 3500) by 30 000 yards. Hocker pin miss cooldown increased to eight seconds. Using a pin on an appliance raised his speed to 8 o’clock (also 2 o’clock). The initial damage of the snake was reduced to 5 (10) at the time of the accident. A total of three years of damage has increased to 2,500. Getting sick is up to 7500 (8200) people. Addition coefficient for 50 points to 2,25 (was 2). It perched, but did absorb the heat in a cut. Developer Note: When the Stinger was perched, there was no cooldown on his projectile so she could quickly attack Cleaners.\n","wordCount":"1282","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-08T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-08T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Elvie Benham"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/day-4-of-blood-december-update-introduces-a-return-to-the-airstream-with-progression-expanderable-adjustments-and-a-lot-more/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Day 4 Of Blood December Update Introduces A Return To The Airstream With Progression Expanderable Adjustments And A Lot More</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-08 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 8, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1282 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Elvie Benham</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>One of the bigger problems withBack 4 Blood was that playing the game solo wasn’t really a viable option, since progression was blocked for those who were playing offline.
