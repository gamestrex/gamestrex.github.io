The stakes are high and with the guests rotating per episode, things tend to get intense. But the host of Is it Cake, Mikey Day does a good job of keeping it light as he uses his machete to slice into the dozens of cakes.\nNetflix Is it Cake Host Well, you can’t have a competition without a host. And Is it Cake has the perfect one. Mikey Day, popularly known for starring in Saturday Night Live has the audience laughing, and enjoying themselves immensely. He wields his machete with grace as he slices through the various cakes and items on the stage. This makes him the perfect Is it Cake host.\nNetflix Is it Cake Contestants Professional bakers that specifically have this skill are not common. In fact, the show only had nine compete. The show may have only had a few competitors but boy did they put up a good fight. The contestants of the Netflix show, Is it Cake are namely:\nAndrew Fuller Steve Weiss Hemu Basu Sam Cade Nina Marie Charles Justin Ellen April Julian Jonny Manganello Dessiree Salaverria\nNetflix Is it Cake Judges To keep things fair and interesting, the show had a huge list of judges that rotated for every episode. They would judge in groups of three and all got to have some delicious cake. Who wouldn’t say yes to that sweet job?\nCamille Kostek Bobby Moynihan Fortune Feimster Hester Sunshine, Michael Yo Jason Bolden Camille Kostek Chris Witaske Kellee Edwards Courtney Parchman Finesse Mitchell Farley Elliott Arturo Castro Jon Gabrus Rebecca Black Tony Rock Lyric Lewis King Princess Brittany Broski Heidi Gardner Dan Ahdoot Loni Love Bobby Moynihan Karamo Brown\n24 judges to cut down the competitors and bring it to one. Maybe one day, I’ll get to be a judge of Is it Cake or maybe the host. Definitely not skilled enough to be a contestant, for sure!\nIs it Cake Season 1 Winner Drumroll please…..ultimately, no matter how good everyone was, there could only be one winner. And that turned out to be the weirdly creative Andrew Fuller! Not only did he win the amazing cash prize of $50,000 but over the course of the show, he won our hearts as well. And that’s a wrap! A delicious one at that. These were all of the contestants, judges, host and winner in the season 1 of the hit show Is it Cake on Netflix. We can’t wait to see the second season and learn more about baking and the secrets of deception.
