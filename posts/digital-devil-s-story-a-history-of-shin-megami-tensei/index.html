The history of the e-books and the series as a result of its many spin-offs, and how Megami Tensei developed a worldwide phenomenon with the dedicated United States fanbase. This list doesn’t cover all megami Tensei meta-series, and games that have never received western releases and are not otherwise notable have been largely excluded. Bolded names indicate very important releases.\nThe genuss of the franchise was 1986-1990. Digital Devil: Megami Tensei (Family, Microsoft, PC, etc.) A movie: The Megami tensei II. Digital Devil story: Megami Tensei (Novel) The Digital Devil: The Demon City of the Old City (Novel): I will get a copy of it. Digital Devil Story 3: The Uninvited Uninvited Evil (Novel)\nThat is the way the megami Tensei franchise began, not with video games (and, yes, technically, the entire franchise is referred to as megami Tensei, not Shin Megami Tensei). The entire trilogy spans dozens of games and starts with three novels by Aya Nishitani, the Digital Devil Story trilogy. It introduces a wide range of concepts that the games would embrace and experiment with, as well as a program that summons demons. Megami Tensei (Credit: mobstets) The games themselves started with Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei, which is directly based on the first novel. We’re following Nishitanis story, but a Digital Devil Story is Megami Tensei that, truly, pointed the series toward a direction that makes Shin Megami Tensei happen. It was a departure from the books and it was about those who used demons to survive post-apocalyptic ruins. That is going to be an important theme in the entire SMT series.\nShin Megami Tensei takes over in Japan: 1990-1994. Majin Tensei (Super Famicom) Majin Kasseyahna: Last Bible (Game Boy). Shin Megami Tensei (Mac/Playstation, Mega-CD, Super Famicom) (pump, games), Mini-PC, Mini-PC, Mac OS/CD/ROM/PC/PC, Computer, etc.) Shin Megami Tensei II (Super Famicom, PlayStation) Shin Megami Tensei If (Super Famicom, PlayStation)\nThe Super Famicom (SNES in North America) is a movie star of Shin Megami Tensei. It became a franchise for Megami Tensei, and Atlus became a developer. Shin Megami Tensei built on Megami Tensei II’s story and mechanics, and introduced several series staples, such as the conflicts between law and chaos, and fusing demons to create stronger demons. Shin Shin Megami Tensei For the Moby Games article. Shin Megami Tensei would see a sequel and one of the series’ first spin-offs, Shin Megami Tensei If. The series was back to school for the first time since Megami Tensei started, and then ran on the theme, then gave the pomegranate to Persona. Shin Shin Ipao Kawa oi Do, as… (Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment) Another spin-off that puts Megami Tensei mechanics into a traditional fantasy setting. It only lasted a few years, but it received four games. Revelations: The last Bible. (Credit: “Hardcore Gaming 101”). None of these games were actually released in the United States at the time of its launch, although Megami Tensei Gaiden: Last Bible’s re-release of Game Boy Color will be localized for the west in 1999. As much as Atlus’s first attempt to bring the series here, it didn’t look too good. The Shin Megami Tensei will be released in 2014 on iOS but wasn’t updated yet, and has since been delisted, perhaps because it doesn’t work on modern Apple devices. This isn’t surprising, because it wasn’t really an ancient method of making music in the west, and the games, despite its extensive religious imagery, may afoul of Nintendo of Americas strict policies against it.\nPersona begins (Seasidely in Japan): 1995-2000. The Devil Summoner: The Ghosts of the Dead, The Man (playStation, Sega Saturn): The Monster Ghosts. Jack Bros (very famous boy) is a virtuose. Persona 2: Playstation: Innocent Sin. Persona 2: Forefathering punishment (PlayStation) Two tales: Persona (Station) Shin Megami Tiensei: Sega Saturn:\nThe late 1990s were the first time Atlus tried to bring the Megami Tensei series to the west, but it failed. It doesn’t make a difference because the wests first exposure to the Megami Tensei series was a run-and-gun game on the Virtual Boy. Yes, the first Megami Tensei game to come out in North America was Jack Bros. That doesn’t do that well as the Virtual Boy itself. Jack Bros. (Credit: Megami Tensei Wiki) Jack Brosnia wasn’t the only one to attempt, though. Atlus swung hard when releasing the first game of its new Persona spin-off series in North America, Revelations: Persona on the PlayStation. The criticisms did not let that happen, but it wasn’t one of the things gamers did. It didn’t help that Final Fantasy VII, one of which would come out two months later, would be on the same system. Peoplea 2: Empowerment. (Covet: Megami Temsei Wiki) In 2000, Atlus was used to the task of “Eternal Punishment”. It was very confusing for the two game’s sequel. On the third, the second game was the sequel of the PSP in 2011. Lastly, a PSP version of Eternal Punishment was unable to be released in North America, so it really baffled me all around.\nNocturne and the Devil: 2001-2004. DemiKids (PS2) is a policeman. Shin Matsuyi Tensei III: Nocturne (DP2)\nShin Tinu-Aj. (Credit: MobyGames) Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne was the first game of the series since 1994, and was the first in North America. The first two games’ first-person dungeon crawled instead of third-person solutions, which included a more intricate level design that leveraged the PlayStation 2’s graphical power. This became a really difficult invention for JRPG fans in the United States, to date with the re-release of it on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Windows earlier this year. Finally, the Megami Tensei series slowly became more popular in the west. DemiKids: Light Version. (Credit: Moby Games) Atlus released Dark and Light versions of the game Boy Advance in the US. This was part of the Devil Children series, which took the main series’ themes and mechanics, and made it a lot harder for children. It didn’t even seem to be able to observe Pokemon.\nPersonality and the hulphernical Golden Age: 2005-2012. Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Sofless Army (PS2) (Summer). The story reveals the story of the Man of the Devil (PD): Raidou Kuzunoha in the ’80s. Persona 3 (PH2, PPS) is in place. Persona 4 (Venticular), Ivan. Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor (DS) (dead-by-self) (MMS) Shin Mashi Tensei: Devil Survivor 2 (DS) The Digital Devil / Saga. Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil: 2:40. Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey (DS)\nNocturne gave the most favourable view to the Western JRPG audience for more Megami Tensei games. Atlus was happy to deliver. The new series, Shin Megami Tensei, wouldn’t debut until 2013, but it would feature a lot of spin-offs that appeal to fans. Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil saga. (Credit: Moby Games) This started with Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil, a big departure from previous games. Instead of recruiting and fusing demons, Digital Devil Saga merged characters with individual demons to make the party much more stable than conventional JRPG. It abandoned the Japanese setting and occupied a wasteland called the Junkyard, making the entire game seem far more alien than others. It would make for a sequel later that year, following its cliffhanger ending, thus making it the direct sequel to the ‘Directed Megami Tensei’ duology. Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the soulless Army. (Credit: Moby Games) Atlus turned the Devil Summoner spin-off series on its head with Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army, an action-RPG established in an alternate 1931 Japanese, completely different from that futuristic dungeon crawler Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers that came before it. The games weren’t as popular as it was with niche fans. Persona 3 (Credit: Moby Games) Then, in 2007, Personnea 3 went out in North America. This made the Persona series a buck in North America with far more graphics and mechanics than the previous Persona games. Both the fans and the critics liked it, and it was a significant step in appealing to the western audience, like Nocturne did. Persona 4 (Credit: Moby Games) Although Persona 4 was not hit in 2008, it was a hit. When Atlus invited players to solve the murder mystery by diving into a television and to explore peoples subconscious, the Megami Tensei series went out of the industry with record sales and critical acclaim. Even though the original Persona 5-star has gotten out, many fans consider Persona 4 (especially the enhanced PlayStation Vita and PC port, Persona 4 Golden) one of the best JRPGs of all time. Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor. (Credit: MobyGames) Since that era was when Atlus began to give a lot of time to the handhelds after the disastrous DemiKids. The sequel to Shin Megami Tensei was a dungeon crawler with an in-person view of first two and second-person events. After the horror story of Shin Megami Tensei 4 arrived, many people took it as a spiritual fourth game in this series. The movie Devil Survivor and Devil Survivor 2 both came from the perspective of Megami Tensei’s story and put it in an isometric turn-based strategy RPG. The two games were great in difficulty, but their depth is unforgiving.\nTrue Goddess Resurrection: 2013-2021. Persona 4: All Night. PS4, Vita. Persona 4 Arena Ultimax (Arcade, PS3, Xbox 360) Persona 5 (PP3, PS4) Persona 5 Strikers (Switch, PS4, Windows) Persona Q: The Labyrinth III. Shin, tensei IV (3DS) Shin Malayai Tensei IV: Apocalypse (3DS) Shin Megami Tensei V (Switch) Tokyo Mirage Seminar #FE (Wii U, Switch)\nPersona 5 (A-mail: Megami Tensei Wiki) The Megami tensei series, developed in North America, has been very well established. Persona 5 started out in 2017, with huge sales and so much critical love, that’s the same style that Persona 4 cultivated. It has created its own jazz-funk identity, too. Persona 4 – Dance all the night. (Directions: Megami Tensei Wiki). There were several spin-off games for the Persona series, and both action and dungeon crawlers included in the plethora of genres. Shin Shin Tamami XI: Apocalypse: apocalypse. (The Author: Moby Games) The main Shin Megami Tensei series returned once again, and has become the most popular one after over a decade, with the Shin Megami Tensei IV, an exclusive Nintendo 3DS package. It was followed by Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse, and together they form another dualology. Tokyo Mirage Sessions: #FE (Credit: Megami Tensei Wiki) The anime show, Shin Megami Tensei, went to the Nintendo Switch, and also came out. The JRPG had a persona-like character that used cinch, instead of a demon in your party. While its release on the unpopular Wii U kept it back, it wasn’t good enough to get the re-release on the Switch. Shin Megami Tensei V. (Credit: Atlus) And that brings us to Shin Megami Tensei V. This Switch-exclusive chapter of the main Shin Megami Tensei series comes out November 12 with a story that seems to be much more of a isekai (Japanese genre of that character, often a high school student, being taken to a strange land for adventures) rather than of a narrative centered around an apocalypse, but rather it’s trying to see where it goes. In fact, Shin Megami Tensei IV appeared to be an all-around fantasy adventure with demons and quickly became much more important.\n","wordCount":"1916","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-31T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-31T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Debra Wesley"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/digital-devil-s-story-a-history-of-shin-megami-tensei/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Digital Devil S Story A History Of Shin Megami Tensei</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-31 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 31, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1916 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Debra Wesley</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#the-genuss-of-the-franchise-was-1986-1990>The genuss of the franchise was 1986-1990.</a></li><li><a href=#shin-megami-tensei-takes-over-in-japan-1990-1994>Shin Megami Tensei takes over in Japan: 1990-1994.</a></li><li><a href=#persona-begins-seasidely-in-japan-1995-2000>Persona begins (Seasidely in Japan): 1995-2000.</a></li><li><a href=#nocturne-and-the-devil-2001-2004>Nocturne and the Devil: 2001-2004.</a></li><li><a href=#personality-and-the-hulphernical-golden-age-2005-2012>Personality and the hulphernical Golden Age: 2005-2012.</a></li><li><a href=#true-goddess-resurrection-2013-2021>True Goddess Resurrection: 2013-2021.</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>That wasn’t always the case.

Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne was the first game of the series since 1994, and was the first in North America. The first two games’ first-person dungeon crawled instead of third-person solutions, which included a more intricate level design that leveraged the PlayStation 2’s graphical power. This became a really difficult invention for JRPG fans in the United States, to date with the re-release of it on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Windows earlier this year. Finally, the Megami Tensei series slowly became more popular in the west.

Atlus released Dark and Light versions of the game Boy Advance in the US. This was part of the Devil Children series, which took the main series’ themes and mechanics, and made it a lot harder for children. It didn’t even seem to be able to observe Pokemon.</p><h2 id=personality-and-the-hulphernical-golden-age-2005-2012>Personality and the hulphernical Golden Age: 2005-2012.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#personality-and-the-hulphernical-golden-age-2005-2012>#</a></h2><p>Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Sofless Army (PS2) (Summer).

The new series, Shin Megami Tensei, wouldn’t debut until 2013, but it would feature a lot of spin-offs that appeal to fans.

This started with Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil, a big departure from previous games. Instead of recruiting and fusing demons, Digital Devil Saga merged characters with individual demons to make the party much more stable than conventional JRPG. It abandoned the Japanese setting and occupied a wasteland called the Junkyard, making the entire game seem far more alien than others. It would make for a sequel later that year, following its cliffhanger ending, thus making it the direct sequel to the ‘Directed Megami Tensei’ duology.

Atlus turned the Devil Summoner spin-off series on its head with Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army, an action-RPG established in an alternate 1931 Japanese, completely different from that futuristic dungeon crawler Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers that came before it. The games weren’t as popular as it was with niche fans.

Then, in 2007, Personnea 3 went out in North America. This made the Persona series a buck in North America with far more graphics and mechanics than the previous Persona games. Both the fans and the critics liked it, and it was a significant step in appealing to the western audience, like Nocturne did.
Persona 4 (Credit: Moby Games)
Although Persona 4 was not hit in 2008, it was a hit. When Atlus invited players to solve the murder mystery by diving into a television and to explore peoples subconscious, the Megami Tensei series went out of the industry with record sales and critical acclaim. Even though the original Persona 5-star has gotten out, many fans consider Persona 4 (especially the enhanced PlayStation Vita and PC port, Persona 4 Golden) one of the best JRPGs of all time.

Since that era was when Atlus began to give a lot of time to the handhelds after the disastrous DemiKids. The sequel to Shin Megami Tensei was a dungeon crawler with an in-person view of first two and second-person events. After the horror story of Shin Megami Tensei 4 arrived, many people took it as a spiritual fourth game in this series. The movie Devil Survivor and Devil Survivor 2 both came from the perspective of Megami Tensei’s story and put it in an isometric turn-based strategy RPG. The two games were great in difficulty, but their depth is unforgiving.</p><h2 id=true-goddess-resurrection-2013-2021>True Goddess Resurrection: 2013-2021.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#true-goddess-resurrection-2013-2021>#</a></h2><p>Persona 4: All Night.

The Megami tensei series, developed in North America, has been very well established. Persona 5 started out in 2017, with huge sales and so much critical love, that’s the same style that Persona 4 cultivated. It has created its own jazz-funk identity, too.

There were several spin-off games for the Persona series, and both action and dungeon crawlers included in the plethora of genres.

The main Shin Megami Tensei series returned once again, and has become the most popular one after over a decade, with the Shin Megami Tensei IV, an exclusive Nintendo 3DS package. It was followed by Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse, and together they form another dualology.

The anime show, Shin Megami Tensei, went to the Nintendo Switch, and also came out. The JRPG had a persona-like character that used cinch, instead of a demon in your party. While its release on the unpopular Wii U kept it back, it wasn’t good enough to get the re-release on the Switch.

And that brings us to Shin Megami Tensei V. This Switch-exclusive chapter of the main Shin Megami Tensei series comes out November 12 with a story that seems to be much more of a isekai (Japanese genre of that character, often a high school student, being taken to a strange land for adventures) rather than of a narrative centered around an apocalypse, but rather it’s trying to see where it goes. In fact, Shin Megami Tensei IV appeared to be an all-around fantasy adventure with demons and quickly became much more important.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/dig-or-die-free-download/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Dig Or Die Free Download</span></a>
