On this page:\nGenshin Impact Xiao Talents, Banner, rarity, element, and weapon Xiao is a 5-Star Anemo character with high DPS (damage per second) who uses a polearm weapon to cause AOE (area of effect) damage primarily by using plunge attacks. Plunging with a polearm while his Elemental Burst is active is Xiao’s main DPS attack.\rHere’s a summary of Xiao’s abilities and stats in Genshin Impact:\nElement: Anemo Rarity: 5-Star Weapon: Polearm Banner: Invitation to Mundane Life Best build: DPS Normal Attack: Whirlwind Thrust Elemental Skill: Lemniscatic Wind Cycling Elemental Burst: Bane of All Evil Passive one: Conqueror of Evil, Tamer of Demons (while under the effects of Bane of All Evil, all damage increases by a further 5% for every three seconds the ability persists, with the maximum damage bonus capping at 25%) Passive two: Dissolution Eon, Heaven Fall (using Lemniscatic Wind Cycling increases the damage of subsequent uses of the ability by 15%, lasts seven seconds at a maximum of three stacks, and gaining a new stack refreshes the effect’s duration) Exploration bonus: Transcension, Gravity Defier (decreases climbing stamina consumption for your party members by 20%, but is not stackable with other teammates who have a Talent that provides the same effect)\nXiao Normal Attack: Whirlwind Thrust Xiao can perform up to six consecutive spear strikes, and when charged, his normal attack consumes stamina to perform an upward thrust. You can press the attack button while in the air to perform a plunge attack, which causes AOE damage. Xiao is one of the few characters who does not take any damage from plunge attacks, regardless of how high he drops.\nElemental Skill: Lemniscatic Wind Cycling Xiao lunges forward, causing Anemo damage to enemies in his path. Lemniscatic Wind Cycling starts with two charges, and can also be used while in mid-air. Using this skill will generate three elemental particles when it hits an enemy, but it will not generate any particles if Bane of All Evil is active. This skill is very useful when exploring, as Xiao can use it twice in a row to bypass large gaps in the environment.\nElemental Burst: Bane of All Evil Xiao wears the Yaksha Mask to greatly increase his jumping ability, AOE range, and attack damage, which is converted into Anemo damage. This can’t be overridden by other elemental infusions. Unfortunately, Xiao continuously loses health while wearing the Yaksha Mask. The effect ends when Xiao leaves the field and is swapped for another active character.\nGenshin Impact Xiao Talent materials To get the most out of using Xiao, you will have to level his abilities up by using Talent materials, which vary from character-to-character.\rFor Xiao, you’re going to need to farm a lot of Slime and Prosperity items (if you don’t already have them) to fully upgrade his DPS capabilities. The table below explains all the Xiao Talent materials and the amount of Mora you need to improve one of his abilities.\rAs Xiao has three combat Talents, you will have to spend three times the Talent materials listed below to fully upgrade all of his abilities.\nGenshin Impact Xiao Ascension materials and Constellation Just like Talents, you need to use Xiao Ascension materials to upgrade his health, attack, defence, and critical hit effectiveness.\rFor Xiao, you’re going to need to farm a lot of Qingxin and and more slime materials (if you don’t already have them) to fully upgrade his DPS capabilities. Unlike Talent materials, you only need to spend the below Ascension materials once to fully raise Xiao to his highest character level. There is also Fate rewarded for reaching certain Ascension levels. You can spend Fate on Banners to Wish for characters or weapons.\rThe table below explains the Xiao Ascension materials and Mora you need to upgrade Xiao, and Fate rewards you gain from Ascension.\nXiao Constellation By getting duplicates of Xiao from wishing on Banners, you will receive his Stella Fortuna. This material allows you to unlock Constellation levels, with each upgrade either improving an existing Talent or Passive ability.\rHere are all of Xiao’s Constellation level upgrades in Genshin Impact:\nDissolution Eon, Destroyer of Worlds: Increases Lemniscatic Wind Cycling’s charges by one. Annihilation Eon, Blossom of Kaleidos: When in the party but not on the field, Xiao’s energy recharge is increases by 25%. Conqueror of Evil, Wrath Deity: Increases the level of Lemniscatic Wind Cycling by three, with a maximum upgrade level of 15. Transcension, Extinction of Suffering: When Xiao’s HP falls below 50% he gains a 100% defence bonus Evolution Eon, Origin of Ignorance Increases the level of Bane of All Evil by three, with a maximum upgrade level of 15. Conqueror of Evil, Guardian Yaksha: While Bane Evil is activated, hitting at least two opponents with Xiao’s plunging attack will grant him one charge of Lemniscatic Wind Cycling, and for the next second, he may use Lemniscatic Wind Cycling regardless of its cooldown status.\nGenshin Impact version 3.3 is here, with new codes, and new character Scaramouche (Wanderer), so find out where he’s placed on our tier list. You’ll need Primogems and luck of the Pity and 50/50 systems to Wish with Fate for him and other current and next banners. You’ll also need the right Adventure Rank for events. For more Sumeru help, we’ve got pages on Sumeru Reputation, Tree of Dreams, Dendroculus locations, the Aeonblight Drake boss, the Garden of Endless Pillars Domain, and locations for Nilotpala Lotus, Padisarah, Scarabs, and Redcrest.\rYou can also now unlock the Genius Invokation TCG and, if you want help building your deck, check out our Genius Invokation TCG Card List.\rIf you want to relax, however, why not try fishing at one of the many fishing spot locations?\nBest Xiao build in Genshin Impact Xiao is an excellent DPS character with a fun playstyle, who is most effective with a good team to support his energy and health needs.\rAs Xiao is a high DPS character whose Elemental Burst costs a lot of energy, he is best paired with a fellow Anemo character, like Sucrose or Venti, so they can recharge Xiao’s energy quickly. You’ll also want to have a party member who can heal Xiao, like Jean or Bennett, as he can lose a lot of health while his Elemental Burst is active.\rIt’s important to play Xiao on the field, using his plunge attacks and Elemental Burst as much as possible, only swapping to other characters when you need to recharge energy or start a healing field. If you swap to another character while Xiao’s Elemental Burst is active, the effect will end and you will lose out on causing damage to enemies.\rThe best Xiao Artifacts in Genshin Impact will either raise his attack or elemental damage stats. It’s best to try for the four piece Vermillion Hereafter set, but any Artifact that boosts his damage is a good substitute.\rAlternatively, if you don’t have a team that can help with Xiao’s energy needs, equipping some Artifacts that help with energy recharge is recommended. This does lower his DPS potential, but it’s better to activate his Elemental Burst as much as possible to get more opportunities to cause high Anemo damage. If running a low energy recharge team, you should take two sub DPS characters instead to raise Xiao’s attack damage as much as possible.\nBest Xiao DPS build With all this in mind, if you want to take advantage of his very high DPS capabilities, we have compiled what we think is currently the best Xiao build in Genshin Impact below:\nBest Weapon: Primordial Jade Winged-Spear (Blackcliff Pole or Prototype Starglitter as substitutes) Best Artifacts: x4 Vermillion Hereafter (or x2 Viridescent Venerer and x2 Gladiator’s Finale) Best team members: A support healer to negate Xiao’s life drain (like Jean or Bennett), another Anemo to help with Elemental recharge (like Sucrose, Jean, or Venti), and a support off-field to increase Xiao’s attack damage/longevity even more (like Fischl, Albedo, or Zhongli)\nWhile it can take a lot of time to find these Artifacts and Ascension/Talent materials to level-up Xiao, it’s worth the effort if you wish to main Xiao as a fairly straight-forward pure DPS character – as long as you have a good team to enhance his Talents.\rGood luck levelling up Xiao in Genshin Impact!\n","wordCount":"1480","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-30T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-30T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Terry Scott"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/genshin-impact-best-xiao-build-ascension-materials-talent-weapon-banner/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Genshin Impact Best Xiao Build Ascension Materials Talent Weapon Banner</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 30, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1480 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Terry Scott</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#genshin-impact-xiao-talents-banner-rarity-element-and-weapon>Genshin Impact Xiao Talents, Banner, rarity, element, and weapon</a><ul><li><a href=#xiao-normal-attack-whirlwind-thrust>Xiao Normal Attack: Whirlwind Thrust</a></li><li><a href=#elemental-skill-lemniscatic-wind-cycling>Elemental Skill: Lemniscatic Wind Cycling</a></li><li><a href=#elemental-burst-bane-of-all-evil>Elemental Burst: Bane of All Evil</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#genshin-impact-xiao-talent-materials>Genshin Impact Xiao Talent materials</a></li><li><a href=#genshin-impact-xiao-ascension-materials-and-constellation>Genshin Impact Xiao Ascension materials and Constellation</a><ul><li><a href=#xiao-constellation>Xiao Constellation</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#best-xiao-build-in-genshin-impact>Best Xiao build in Genshin Impact</a><ul><li><a href=#best-xiao-dps-build>Best Xiao DPS build</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>The reclusive Adepti is featured in his own Banner, Invitation to Mundane Life, in which you can spend Fate on Wishes to try and get him.

Good luck levelling up Xiao in Genshin Impact!</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Xiao-Genshin-Impact.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Xiao-Genshin-Impact.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact best Xiao build  Ascension materials  Talent  weapon  Banner - 17"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Genshin-Impact-Slime-Concentrate.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Genshin-Impact-Slime-Concentrate.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact best Xiao build  Ascension materials  Talent  weapon  Banner - 96"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Genshin-Impact-Qingxin.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Genshin-Impact-Qingxin.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact best Xiao build  Ascension materials  Talent  weapon  Banner - 9"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Xiao-Elemental-Burst-Genshin-Impact.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Xiao-Elemental-Burst-Genshin-Impact.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact best Xiao build  Ascension materials  Talent  weapon  Banner - 85"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Genshin-Impact-Xiao-best-team.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Genshin-Impact-Xiao-best-team.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact best Xiao build  Ascension materials  Talent  weapon  Banner - 89"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Xiao-best-weapon-Primordial-Jade-Winged-Spear.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Xiao-best-weapon-Primordial-Jade-Winged-Spear.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact best Xiao build  Ascension materials  Talent  weapon  Banner - 43"></p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/genshin-impact-2-8-banner-and-event-details/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Genshin Impact 2 8 Banner And Event Details</span></a>
