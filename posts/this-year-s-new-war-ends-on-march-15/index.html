We will keep up with you when we go!\nWarframe update 2.67 Notes | Warframe update 1.014 Notes | Warframe update 31 The New War Patch Notes: The New War is 7.5 GB on PS4 and 7.9 GB on PS5 (size variations are expected based on the ways the different systems operate), The New War is 6.6 GB on XBOX One and XBOX Series X (size variations are expected based on the ways in which the different systems operate). NON INTENTIONS DU NON MARCHEUR DUURS INSUMER! We’re all seasons. Growing in darkness, fading in the dark. Now, the same, yet, have all changed. Take the stairs, Tenno. New War is here, but nobody’s safe. When old enemies returned to the Origin System, will a faction of Ballas and Erra factions unite against the advancing Sentients, or will they buckle a full-scale invasion? Players can prepare their new war quest on one or two occasions: Prerequisites\nHave the pre-War preparation ready? We have changed the old Codex section to Prelude to War, and players have to complete this full order to participate in The New War Quest. Own a Necramech. Necramechs are used to winning a casino, or to get cash for Platinum. You’ll have a cabafe. A Railjack can be earned by completed the Rising Tide quest or by buying up a Platinum pen on the Market.\nNew War will take several hours to complete, so the normal Warframe work won’t run until the end of the quest. Plan accordingly! You’ll be restricted to your loadouts. We encourage you to build a Warframe, an Ncramech, an Operator, and an Ironjack Loadout, but also a Fashion Frame. You’re always letting a friend say, I CAN’t listen to that one! You may see your Operator sounds a bit different as he played The New War Quest. We hope that your current operator voices will be enjoyable. The familiar voice of Pre and Post-New War Operators will become known to you. A new accessibilitysetting was added for Struggle Action. This allows you to select either Hold or Tap if confronted with a conflict between opponents, where typically a mashing of a button would be requested. We recommend that you put this setting to your preference before the new War Quest to make sure you have the best experience. Players can turn on this in the arrows menu anytime in the quest, just above the arrows. A lot of effort has been spent to leveraging new graphics technologies and the level of the new war’s ability. The Playstation 5 uses this setting already. ***You can’t play the New War Quest once it’s done by this update. This is a feasible 2022 addition. Enjoy it, and we’re excited. NOTE: Only 5 new weapons are available after The New War. We will not denot them here for spoilers but seek them out once you’ve done the Quest! There are also some Boosters of all sizes at the end of the New War. NEW GREENBALL VALIDIAN. This is Caliban, the survivor, the adaptor, and heir of the twin kingdoms of biological and Sentient life. Free him from the aberrant path he was bound to by his creator, Erra. The nifty dollar store is one of the most expensive with his most expensive, low-cost, silver-colored prints from the tyre. In addition, CalibansPrex Cardcan are found after the completion of the New War Quest at a new location. Hide contents Caliban Component Blueprints can be purchased through Narmer Bounties in daylight on the Eidolon plains, and Orb Vallis on the Night cycle (Teaching in Cetus means a Bounty is available in Orb Vallis). Narmer has a few coins after the new war quest. APASSIVE ARMOR (SURRPOR) ADAPTIVE (PASSIVE) Allies in the Affinity range gain up to 50% resistance to the types of damage they are currently taking.\nNote that this does not stack additively to the Adaptation mod.\nRAZOR GYRE Take care of death. Put the switch to the button right in front of the mouse to be more powerful and reduce the damage of a man or target an enemy by clicking the switch right in front of the mouse. To kill enemies inflicted with Sentient Wrath produces a devastating explosion. SENTIENT WRATH Get the ground out, as well as a wave of destruction. In a short amount of time, those not killed by the initial explosion are relieved in the air. *Sentine Brath is Calibans Helminth Undersume ability. LETHAL PROGENY Call on Calibans Sentient aspect to take up to three Conculyst comrades to fight against his side and repair their shields. FUSION STRIKE Converge three streams of raw energy in a single point, thus causing a massive reactive blast. The fallout over the blast will strip the armor and shields from all enemies that touch it. Don’t miss Calibans Noble \u0026 Agile Animations! With a floating animation, our first male-presenting Warframe! VENATO Calibans signature scythe, which is forged from a limb that fell onto an Eidolon a thousand years ago. Caliban increase the 50 % chance of raising the coincaps of Melee compared to their counterparts. NEUROVYRE SYANDANA An arrow-shaped-symbiote named Syandana is a Sententine symbiote of Calibans. SPORAVYRE SUGATRA The docile Sentine possesses a weapon decoration. ORAL BY GORRY WELCOME SORCH SORCH LOSSE. A fearsome alternative helmet gives Caliban a look he hasn’t worn since the War. The FARM GROUP: After finishing the Quest, review the exam. Spoiler\nA new resource, New Set Mods, new Amps and Weapon Blueprints are available in Bounties to those who have completed The New War Quest. This new resource can also be used to collect resources if applicable.\nListed below, Calibans’ Component Blueprints can be used on these Bounties.\nOnce you finish the New War Quest, a new post-quest setting is already available in the Star Chart directly. Don’t miss it!\nIn the Personal Quarters of your Orbiter, after the New War, there are new options.\nHARROW PRIME SYLBRONEA is ARRIVE! HARROW PRIME The inquisitor eternal arises, hallowed by the Void, preaching a gospel containing iron and flame. SCOURGE PRIME Smit the nonrighteous with the signature gun of Harrow Primes. KNELL PRIME Call the Harrow Primes pistol to collect a toll from enemies’ skulls. SYANDANA NAVE PERFORMENTS. Let your Primer get this golden Syandana of holy office. TEMPLAR PRIME SUIT: A faithful legison wears the dress uniform proudly. PLUS! As an addition to his QoL, we made tweaks to his kit. Passive Harrow and Harrow Prime have now developed the Mod modes for Preparation and are passive, meaning Harrow has now +100% maximum energy that can be filled with Spawn. Condemn\nRadius growth is now in line with Range. Added a tonon scaling area of effect around Harrow that gets hit by it like Proteas Blaze Artillery, to address hit enemies that are right on top of you.\nPenance\nAdded a second burst of healing from sacrificed Shields.\nThurible\nWe have an increase in cost.\nPrime Ivara, Prime Baza, and Prime Aksomati come to Prime Voault! Since we are not in the 2021 o’clock rush for the upcoming Resurgence event, these prime items won’t be added to this run of the Resurgence event. Premiere Resurgence is our first attempt at more major events with the same prominence of New War. Well have plenty to study on the first and last day of Prime Resurgence to be able to dict our progress. If you don’t understand the Prime Resurgence event, be sure to enlighten us in our official Dev Workshop. After Vaulting comes the shift of Syndicate Sacrifices:\nPerrins Sequence Sacrifice of Baza Prime Stock with Panthera Prime Receiver. Perrin Splice – Sacrifice of the Prime Systems Ivara with the Prime Chassis Octavia. Remplaced Red Veil Sacrifice of Theiva Prime Chassis with Nizha Prime Chassis.\nRiven Disposition Change: Check the list of the latest versions of the Prime Access program. See full Version. If you utilize these primes already or have their Relics in your inventory, they will continue to be unused. Legendary Rank 2-Signal:\nAlthough we’ve got enough content to shave Legendary Rank 2, we are resuscending the test until 2022. This decision was not lightly made, but we felt we could not perform the necessary tests to release them in this build.\nNEW COSMETICS Platinum is available on the in-game Market. The Protovyre is a new cosmetic set and is evolving. To become a first-class cosmetic that grows as you complete the tasks the need arises. ARMOR PROTOVYROR (CHEST, SEARCH, \u0026 LEG) There is an evolving armor set that uses Sentine technology. Defeat Sentient enemies with this Armor equipped to unlock two more looks. PROTOVYRE SYANDANA Creating a new Syandana that uses Sentient technology. To unlock two more looks, assemble Relics and Ayas. PROTOVYRE EPHEMERA An evolving Ephemera is built on Sentine technology.

At theProtovyretier, followed by the Protovyre Emergenttier and the final Protovyre Apextier. Progress toward each tier is saved and can be returned to at any point. Progress can be sorted out by the arsenal description and UI popups for the cosmetics and the in-mission UI. SKIN WITH MESA PROJECTIONALLYST SMILE. Mesa resembling her as the Sentients would have designed her. VOLT ELECTROLYST SKIN. He would have lived well, should the Sentients created him. KERULYST SENTINEL SKIN KERULYST. Give your Sentinel the appearance of a Kerulyst, lower-res, but that evolved to become powerful laborers in the Tau System. NARMER SHAWZIN READ AT YOUR RISK. NEW DECORATIONS An 11th Dojo and 13th Orbiter Decoration have been added. All of this new decoration will be based on The New War Quest. Check them out once you’ve finished the Quest! Three new Community-made displays have been added.These are available now for purchase and buy with Platinum. The pieces are available by Twitch Drops on Sunday, December 14th at 14 o’clock. ET December 21st, 2 p.m. ET.\nKahl-175 Community Display byMura Casardis. At the Veso Community Show Karu, TBG, the Veso logo. Teshin Community Display byDatLoon byDatLoon.\nREY / PERFORMANCE REY PERFORMANCE CHANGES: We continuously wanted to improve the accessibility of Quest related items (Emp, etc.) and reduce the Standard of Vox Solaris Sacrifice. The Syndicate makes its way through higher-class offer.\nRank 5 (Chasse) Crisma Toroid from 5 to 3 is now available. Repeller Systems from 5 to 3rd Grade. Rank 4 (Instrument) Sola Toroid, 10, to 5, and a size 10 from 10 to 5? Repeller Systems from five to three. Place 3 (Hand) Calda Toroid from 10 to 5 by means of the name. Atmo Systems at 10 to 5 people are able to use atmo technology. Rank 1 (Agent) is the Rank 2 of the ranks. Vega Toroid from 10 to 5 is from 10. Gyromag Systems from 15 to 8 o’clock. Rank 1 (Operative) Calda Toroid from 2 to 1 Add to Vega’s Toroid from 2 to 1 o’clock. Sola Toroid from two to 1 is sold at the same time.\nOPTIMIZATIONS:\nOptimized the rabid-rabidometer. Noggles’ performance is improved. Made multiple micro-optimizations to reduce the memory footprint. Precision optimization made systemic microoptimizations to meet load requirement. Power upgrades used during transmission. Made micro-optimizations for Playstation.\nGENERAL CHANGES:\nWe altered the SKIP CINEMATIC confirmation to include a HOLD BUT, instead of going to get the same order. This is intended to stop players who often skip cinematics from a button mashing a way that could seriously stop the Quest storyline experience. This change does not affect regular gameplay cinematic skipping (mission fly-in/drop-down etc). Companions will receive 100% of Affinity from kills you make. This matches shared Affinity functionality (you receive 100%, Companion receives 100%). Moved the Ghoul Bounty Aya drops to the final phase instead of being in the majority of the Phases. Like I said above. The Operator Voice icons were updated to reflect their title. You may have noticed this before, but email displays on the login screen will now always be censored, whether it’s using Creator Mode or not. Your email will only display the first and last two letters before the domain, and the letters in between are censored as asterisks. Decrease our accessorized the login email lock icon by hovering text into a single-shape to read “All passwords” and clear email to clarify the function. Creator Mode still censors your email to become asterisk. The email domain is not censored by default, so please use the Creator Mode to hide your whole email. Moved the K-Driven Race objective markers closer to the actual K-Drive instead of wagging many meters. The grineer Lancers got a far higher back space to find cover, so they could shoot for longer. Enemies are more likely to throw grenades at targets with cover. Removed Tenet Livia, Primary Kitgun beam-based weapons, Cadus and Volnus Prime from the Conclave. These new weapons were in the Conclave without proper balance passes. Set up max instances on Mirages Eclipse loops so they don’t multiply out of control when Hall of Mirrors is used. The transverse adjustment for the x w, so that he doesn’t get a bit off in the middle. AI cover positions are adjusted to be more consistent. Brachiolysts are going to be punished instead of equipping electroprods. Decals on Harrows Condemn now uses Deferred Rendering to earn better performance. When you put off the Nidus, made slightly modifications to the Prime Chest Plate. Rescue Targets are incredibly unlikely to go after an AFK player more than an active player now. Juno Geminex Moas projectiles aOE damage, respects line-of-sight and won’t deal damage through cover. Changed the Dojo Orokin Lab description to Void focused research to remove obsolete Solar Rails-indicator. The Quest Codex section is now ordered, just like in the previously intended order of progression. The Quests you haven’t completed for free will remain top of the list for ease of access. More depth has been done to older hair materials.\nFIXES:\nFixed Companions can’t receive shared Affinity from other players when you are in Necramech or Operation. When the script crashed, it was transferred to the operator. If you succumbed to an injury, the Specter got lost in the fight and was not able to get involved in the Specter fight. Quickly following an attack, a misfortune caused an uptick quickly spreading. Fixed Steel Path Hijack is an object of normal quality and has proper health. Fixed enemies struggling to target the Hijack escort. Fixed Junction Specter is normal level of the shortest time while trying to complete it on Steel Lane. Fixed Client players saw Mission Failed screen after leaving railjack between missions. Fixed transfer between the service provider and Warframe would not like that burden of money. Fixed an issue with spot-loading Archwing, K-Drive, Necramech etc. when returning to the Orbiter (distance when returning to ship would freeze while fading out). By using the K-Drive, you would be able to ragdoll yourself through Cambion Drift. Fixed the Titanias Solstice skin, with the Prime Details toggle missing. Hek and Sobek were missing the hit effect. Fixed Aya dropped into the Open Zone Bounties due to the stretching of icon imagery. Fixed players are not taking damage over time outside Purifier bubbles if Armor is 0% in Infested Salvage missions (Oestrus, Eris). Fixed that Yareli can take the chance to enter Orphix field by riding on Merulina. The energy circle in the right of the screen was getting greyed out. Fixed not able to install the Forma you bought from the arsenal Warframe upgrade screen. Fixed locked Nightwave Acts showing how to read the Act. Only unlocked Acts show how-to instructions to avoid spoilers. Fixed script error when opening Prime Resurgence scheduled from Varzias wares. Fixed Mind Controlling Thralls as yx prevents its killing from a melee finisher. Fixed missing button callouts so that mouse/joysticks leave and right. When the left button rotates the decoration, you get a hint to move the right stick left/right, as well as when scaling a button, and the hint to move the stick up/down. Fixed Clients who join the Host missions aren’t seeing pickup resources after a Host Migration. Gausss gauge in Redline had a puffy smoke effect on it. Fixed an issue where clicking the plus icon in the squad panel while in Solo mode gave two errors popups. Despite the fact that Clients are taking up Yareli, the Vacuum-like mods weren’t working all the time, so the customer is not able to ride Merulina. We became caught off, and became caught by motor motors when the bus stopped while driving into the map front of the Eidolon plains. The Teralyst is fixing the script error. Sometimes transmissions have been inoperable. Fixed the script error with the Aerolysts projectiles. The problem is that bosss can be triggered while a player is out of place as an Operator, locking them out of the game. Fixed animation issues where enemies wouldn’t turn back when they approached them. Fixed the possibility to dodge Trade Zone restrictions in the Maroos Bazaar around Varzia by jumping. We fixed-loading from Larvling in-mission to generate Kuva Lich weapons. Fixed Dojo Decorate Mode HUD legend only showing two options if opened through the Dojo console rather than the menu. In case of an incomplete Tenno guide, the missing prompts were repaired. When you can replicate Decorations, write error. Fixed several Armor angioplastys that scrounged through Nidus Kuvael Scrounger Skin. Fixed a harmful script error that could occur during the fight against the Exploiter Orb. The script bug could come up if you caught a fish soon after the migration. Fixed Deimos Claws Having the Skin ill appear in mission when equipped with Keratinos. Since you changed your Necramech weapon, the Archwing loadout doesn’t work. Fixed Juggernauts stomp no more attack spawning new enemies. Fixed that inability to place Decorations on the Codex table in the Orbiter would be good for that. When viewed from the front door into the room, noticed a flickering glass texture in one of the Corpus Outpost Spy windows of the central tower. Fixed chained mission in the Corps ship delaying the over-dark. We fixed the inability to view the codex which runs of the Railjacks and the Granums. Fixed a stalker spawning and pushing you into the other side of the tunnel. Having fixed and replete an enemy which was lost Xaku Gaze, Loki Radial Disarm, Baruuk deolates and serene Storm, Naramon Defensive, Gorilla Depression Magnetism, or Kubrow Neutralism puts an indebted attack on mission. Fixed multiple issues while clicking Quests in the Codex. Fixed Syndicate Relic Pack incorrectly stating a guaranteed Rare as it pulls the description from the market Relic Pack. Fixed Nightwave Act description for Day Trader claiming only 1 win is required when in fact it is 3. Fixed Titanias Razorwing kills on normal ground missions due to the advance of The From On High Challenge. The omission to use an ungilded moa instead of an ungilded hound was fixed in trying to polarize. Fixed Landing Craft Skin always means you don’t own that Landing Craft when you do, though. Fixed Augments are not being properly marked as the property of the Syndicate Offerings. Several Syandanas aren’t sitting on Railjack Crew members. If a hive the first step, dick the third round, then exhilarate the Necralisk. Adding the hoops to Equinox skin’s waist by the leg while installing on Equinox prime was fixed. If you were to hang out in the Cambion Drift, you removed the overly aggressive UI shake. Fixed the problem that I was unable to replicate the Ayatan Statues in the Dojo if there was any variation in the Vault. Fixed normal Star Chart nodes being locked after an event expires (e.g., Necralisk after Night of Naberus). Fixed Mods marked NEW throughout the mission, in addition to those who have lost the NEW tag on the end of the mission’s screen. Using one of Vors taunt Transmissions play two times in two different missions during a Presidency Quest. Tyl Regors Shield now has a Shield Regeneration delay of 2 seconds, compared with how it instantly regenerates now, thereby giving new players more chance.\nDevelopers and players demanded that he remove spoilers, but they also remove spoilers. Developers offer an Open Letter: The New War comes to an end. The cinematic quest came together from all the people of our team and gathered from all over the world to bring it to you. Perhaps it was too long for some veteran Tenno, but it ended today. After the beginning of the year 2018 we planned on the New War trailer. Over the course of the years, the events moved on and ended with some cryptic hints, and finally lock-down happened, which truly meant that a year back. This isn’t a great excuse, it’s a fact that deserves attention. We were planning to ship the cinematic quest experience much earlier, but the delays caused us, then the world’s delays were eventually here, but that ended now. While we were waiting for our surprise, we could not end up with it. The Tenno story. New War is the biggest in the history of Digital Extremes, and we also have new perspectives for our Tenno. It’s been many years since the Tenno realized a clear story point. We now have that long goal: to take the second dream and save it. If you have started the journey, you’ll have better planned it, so make sure you’re prepared. The New War is here. The stage is going to be set for the future. So long as you’ve finished, join us in 2022 for the next Warframe in a post-New War world. Tenno, thank you for your patience and kindness. That’s a lot of new stuff!

IMPORTANT: As we have already said, there’s 2 patched in order to fully update the update. We’ve prepared the first patch, and we’re waiting for the successful release before the second. Due to this, there may be a little time between launches. If this process takes place, you’ll be expected to get a version mismatch error, whereas this time you’ll be asked to get the latest, which means your system is waiting for the second deploy. We will keep up with you when we go!</p><h3 id=warframe-update-267-notes--warframe-update-1014-notes--warframe-update-31-the-new-war-patch-notes>Warframe update 2.67 Notes | Warframe update 1.014 Notes | Warframe update 31 The New War Patch Notes:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#warframe-update-267-notes--warframe-update-1014-notes--warframe-update-31-the-new-war-patch-notes>#</a></h3><p>The New War is 7.5 GB on PS4 and 7.9 GB on PS5 (size variations are expected based on the ways the different systems operate), The New War is 6.6 GB on XBOX One and XBOX Series X (size variations are expected based on the ways in which the different systems operate).
NON INTENTIONS DU NON MARCHEUR DUURS INSUMER!
We’re all seasons.
Growing in darkness, fading in the dark.
Now, the same, yet, have all changed.
Take the stairs, Tenno. New War is here, but nobody’s safe. When old enemies returned to the Origin System, will a faction of Ballas and Erra factions unite against the advancing Sentients, or will they buckle a full-scale invasion?
Players can prepare their new war quest on one or two occasions:
Prerequisites</p><p>Have the pre-War preparation ready? We have changed the old Codex section to Prelude to War, and players have to complete this full order to participate in The New War Quest. Own a Necramech. Necramechs are used to winning a casino, or to get cash for Platinum. You’ll have a cabafe. A Railjack can be earned by completed the Rising Tide quest or by buying up a Platinum pen on the Market.</p><p>New War will take several hours to complete, so the normal Warframe work won’t run until the end of the quest. Plan accordingly!
You’ll be restricted to your loadouts. We encourage you to build a Warframe, an Ncramech, an Operator, and an Ironjack Loadout, but also a Fashion Frame. You’re always letting a friend say, I CAN’t listen to that one!
You may see your Operator sounds a bit different as he played The New War Quest. We hope that your current operator voices will be enjoyable. The familiar voice of Pre and Post-New War Operators will become known to you.
A new accessibilitysetting was added for Struggle Action. This allows you to select either Hold or Tap if confronted with a conflict between opponents, where typically a mashing of a button would be requested. We recommend that you put this setting to your preference before the new War Quest to make sure you have the best experience. Players can turn on this in the arrows menu anytime in the quest, just above the arrows.
A lot of effort has been spent to leveraging new graphics technologies and the level of the new war’s ability. The Playstation 5 uses this setting already.
***You can’t play the New War Quest once it’s done by this update. This is a feasible 2022 addition. Enjoy it, and we’re excited.
NOTE: Only 5 new weapons are available after The New War. We will not denot them here for spoilers but seek them out once you’ve done the Quest! There are also some Boosters of all sizes at the end of the New War.
NEW GREENBALL VALIDIAN. This is Caliban, the survivor, the adaptor, and heir of the twin kingdoms of biological and Sentient life. Free him from the aberrant path he was bound to by his creator, Erra.
The nifty dollar store is one of the most expensive with his most expensive, low-cost, silver-colored prints from the tyre. In addition, CalibansPrex Cardcan are found after the completion of the New War Quest at a new location.
Hide contents
Caliban Component Blueprints can be purchased through Narmer Bounties in daylight on the Eidolon plains, and Orb Vallis on the Night cycle (Teaching in Cetus means a Bounty is available in Orb Vallis). Narmer has a few coins after the new war quest.
APASSIVE ARMOR (SURRPOR) ADAPTIVE (PASSIVE) Allies in the Affinity range gain up to 50% resistance to the types of damage they are currently taking.</p><p>Note that this does not stack additively to the Adaptation mod.</p><p>RAZOR GYRE Take care of death. Put the switch to the button right in front of the mouse to be more powerful and reduce the damage of a man or target an enemy by clicking the switch right in front of the mouse. To kill enemies inflicted with Sentient Wrath produces a devastating explosion. SENTIENT WRATH Get the ground out, as well as a wave of destruction. In a short amount of time, those not killed by the initial explosion are relieved in the air.
*Sentine Brath is Calibans Helminth Undersume ability.
LETHAL PROGENY Call on Calibans Sentient aspect to take up to three Conculyst comrades to fight against his side and repair their shields.
FUSION STRIKE Converge three streams of raw energy in a single point, thus causing a massive reactive blast. The fallout over the blast will strip the armor and shields from all enemies that touch it.
Don’t miss Calibans Noble & Agile Animations! With a floating animation, our first male-presenting Warframe!
VENATO Calibans signature scythe, which is forged from a limb that fell onto an Eidolon a thousand years ago. Caliban increase the 50 % chance of raising the coincaps of Melee compared to their counterparts.
NEUROVYRE SYANDANA An arrow-shaped-symbiote named Syandana is a Sententine symbiote of Calibans.
SPORAVYRE SUGATRA The docile Sentine possesses a weapon decoration.
ORAL BY GORRY WELCOME SORCH SORCH LOSSE. A fearsome alternative helmet gives Caliban a look he hasn’t worn since the War.
The FARM GROUP: After finishing the Quest, review the exam.
Spoiler</p><p>A new resource, New Set Mods, new Amps and Weapon Blueprints are available in Bounties to those who have completed The New War Quest. This new resource can also be used to collect resources if applicable.</p><p>Listed below, Calibans’ Component Blueprints can be used on these Bounties.</p><p>Once you finish the New War Quest, a new post-quest setting is already available in the Star Chart directly. Don’t miss it!</p><p>In the Personal Quarters of your Orbiter, after the New War, there are new options.</p><p>HARROW PRIME SYLBRONEA is ARRIVE!
HARROW PRIME The inquisitor eternal arises, hallowed by the Void, preaching a gospel containing iron and flame.
SCOURGE PRIME Smit the nonrighteous with the signature gun of Harrow Primes.
KNELL PRIME Call the Harrow Primes pistol to collect a toll from enemies’ skulls.
SYANDANA NAVE PERFORMENTS. Let your Primer get this golden Syandana of holy office.
TEMPLAR PRIME SUIT: A faithful legison wears the dress uniform proudly. PLUS! As an addition to his QoL, we made tweaks to his kit.
Passive
Harrow and Harrow Prime have now developed the Mod modes for Preparation and are passive, meaning Harrow has now +100% maximum energy that can be filled with Spawn.
Condemn</p><p>Radius growth is now in line with Range. Added a tonon scaling area of effect around Harrow that gets hit by it like Proteas Blaze Artillery, to address hit enemies that are right on top of you.</p><p>Penance</p><p>Added a second burst of healing from sacrificed Shields.</p><p>Thurible</p><p>We have an increase in cost.</p><p>Prime Ivara, Prime Baza, and Prime Aksomati come to Prime Voault!
Since we are not in the 2021 o’clock rush for the upcoming Resurgence event, these prime items won’t be added to this run of the Resurgence event.
Premiere Resurgence is our first attempt at more major events with the same prominence of New War. Well have plenty to study on the first and last day of Prime Resurgence to be able to dict our progress. If you don’t understand the Prime Resurgence event, be sure to enlighten us in our official Dev Workshop.
After Vaulting comes the shift of Syndicate Sacrifices:</p><p>Perrins Sequence Sacrifice of Baza Prime Stock with Panthera Prime Receiver. Perrin Splice – Sacrifice of the Prime Systems Ivara with the Prime Chassis Octavia. Remplaced Red Veil Sacrifice of Theiva Prime Chassis with Nizha Prime Chassis.</p><p>Riven Disposition Change:
Check the list of the latest versions of the Prime Access program. See full Version.
If you utilize these primes already or have their Relics in your inventory, they will continue to be unused. Legendary Rank 2-Signal:</p><p>Although we’ve got enough content to shave Legendary Rank 2, we are resuscending the test until 2022. This decision was not lightly made, but we felt we could not perform the necessary tests to release them in this build.</p><p>NEW COSMETICS Platinum is available on the in-game Market. The Protovyre is a new cosmetic set and is evolving. To become a first-class cosmetic that grows as you complete the tasks the need arises.

How Do the atoxamine Cosmetics work?
One tier is permanently unlocked and can be attached to your Arsenal as a single attachment once necessary. At theProtovyretier, followed by the Protovyre Emergenttier and the final Protovyre Apextier. Progress toward each tier is saved and can be returned to at any point. Progress can be sorted out by the arsenal description and UI popups for the cosmetics and the in-mission UI.
SKIN WITH MESA PROJECTIONALLYST SMILE. Mesa resembling her as the Sentients would have designed her.
VOLT ELECTROLYST SKIN. He would have lived well, should the Sentients created him.
KERULYST SENTINEL SKIN KERULYST. Give your Sentinel the appearance of a Kerulyst, lower-res, but that evolved to become powerful laborers in the Tau System.
NARMER SHAWZIN READ AT YOUR RISK. NEW DECORATIONS
An 11th Dojo and 13th Orbiter Decoration have been added. All of this new decoration will be based on The New War Quest. Check them out once you’ve finished the Quest!
Three new Community-made displays have been added.These are available now for purchase and buy with Platinum. The pieces are available by Twitch Drops on Sunday, December 14th at 14 o’clock. ET December 21st, 2 p.m. ET.</p><p>Kahl-175 Community Display byMura Casardis. At the Veso Community Show Karu, TBG, the Veso logo. Teshin Community Display byDatLoon byDatLoon.</p><p>REY / PERFORMANCE REY PERFORMANCE CHANGES:
We continuously wanted to improve the accessibility of Quest related items (Emp, etc.) and reduce the Standard of Vox Solaris Sacrifice. The Syndicate makes its way through higher-class offer.</p><p>Rank 5 (Chasse) Crisma Toroid from 5 to 3 is now available. Repeller Systems from 5 to 3rd Grade. Rank 4 (Instrument) Sola Toroid, 10, to 5, and a size 10 from 10 to 5? Repeller Systems from five to three. Place 3 (Hand) Calda Toroid from 10 to 5 by means of the name. Atmo Systems at 10 to 5 people are able to use atmo technology. Rank 1 (Agent) is the Rank 2 of the ranks. Vega Toroid from 10 to 5 is from 10. Gyromag Systems from 15 to 8 o’clock. Rank 1 (Operative) Calda Toroid from 2 to 1 Add to Vega’s Toroid from 2 to 1 o’clock. Sola Toroid from two to 1 is sold at the same time.</p><p>OPTIMIZATIONS:</p><p>Optimized the rabid-rabidometer. Noggles’ performance is improved. Made multiple micro-optimizations to reduce the memory footprint. Precision optimization made systemic microoptimizations to meet load requirement. Power upgrades used during transmission. Made micro-optimizations for Playstation.</p><p>GENERAL CHANGES:</p><p>We altered the SKIP CINEMATIC confirmation to include a HOLD BUT, instead of going to get the same order. This is intended to stop players who often skip cinematics from a button mashing a way that could seriously stop the Quest storyline experience. This change does not affect regular gameplay cinematic skipping (mission fly-in/drop-down etc). Companions will receive 100% of Affinity from kills you make. This matches shared Affinity functionality (you receive 100%, Companion receives 100%). Moved the Ghoul Bounty Aya drops to the final phase instead of being in the majority of the Phases. Like I said above. The Operator Voice icons were updated to reflect their title. You may have noticed this before, but email displays on the login screen will now always be censored, whether it’s using Creator Mode or not. Your email will only display the first and last two letters before the domain, and the letters in between are censored as asterisks. Decrease our accessorized the login email lock icon by hovering text into a single-shape to read “All passwords” and clear email to clarify the function. Creator Mode still censors your email to become asterisk. The email domain is not censored by default, so please use the Creator Mode to hide your whole email. Moved the K-Driven Race objective markers closer to the actual K-Drive instead of wagging many meters. The grineer Lancers got a far higher back space to find cover, so they could shoot for longer. Enemies are more likely to throw grenades at targets with cover. Removed Tenet Livia, Primary Kitgun beam-based weapons, Cadus and Volnus Prime from the Conclave. These new weapons were in the Conclave without proper balance passes. Set up max instances on Mirages Eclipse loops so they don’t multiply out of control when Hall of Mirrors is used. The transverse adjustment for the x w, so that he doesn’t get a bit off in the middle. AI cover positions are adjusted to be more consistent. Brachiolysts are going to be punished instead of equipping electroprods. Decals on Harrows Condemn now uses Deferred Rendering to earn better performance. When you put off the Nidus, made slightly modifications to the Prime Chest Plate. Rescue Targets are incredibly unlikely to go after an AFK player more than an active player now. Juno Geminex Moas projectiles aOE damage, respects line-of-sight and won’t deal damage through cover. Changed the Dojo Orokin Lab description to Void focused research to remove obsolete Solar Rails-indicator. The Quest Codex section is now ordered, just like in the previously intended order of progression. The Quests you haven’t completed for free will remain top of the list for ease of access. More depth has been done to older hair materials.</p><p>FIXES:</p><p>Fixed Companions can’t receive shared Affinity from other players when you are in Necramech or Operation. When the script crashed, it was transferred to the operator. If you succumbed to an injury, the Specter got lost in the fight and was not able to get involved in the Specter fight. Quickly following an attack, a misfortune caused an uptick quickly spreading. Fixed Steel Path Hijack is an object of normal quality and has proper health. Fixed enemies struggling to target the Hijack escort. Fixed Junction Specter is normal level of the shortest time while trying to complete it on Steel Lane. Fixed Client players saw Mission Failed screen after leaving railjack between missions. Fixed transfer between the service provider and Warframe would not like that burden of money. Fixed an issue with spot-loading Archwing, K-Drive, Necramech etc. when returning to the Orbiter (distance when returning to ship would freeze while fading out). By using the K-Drive, you would be able to ragdoll yourself through Cambion Drift. Fixed the Titanias Solstice skin, with the Prime Details toggle missing. Hek and Sobek were missing the hit effect. Fixed Aya dropped into the Open Zone Bounties due to the stretching of icon imagery. Fixed players are not taking damage over time outside Purifier bubbles if Armor is 0% in Infested Salvage missions (Oestrus, Eris). Fixed that Yareli can take the chance to enter Orphix field by riding on Merulina. The energy circle in the right of the screen was getting greyed out. Fixed not able to install the Forma you bought from the arsenal Warframe upgrade screen. Fixed locked Nightwave Acts showing how to read the Act. Only unlocked Acts show how-to instructions to avoid spoilers. Fixed script error when opening Prime Resurgence scheduled from Varzias wares. Fixed Mind Controlling Thralls as yx prevents its killing from a melee finisher. Fixed missing button callouts so that mouse/joysticks leave and right. When the left button rotates the decoration, you get a hint to move the right stick left/right, as well as when scaling a button, and the hint to move the stick up/down. Fixed Clients who join the Host missions aren’t seeing pickup resources after a Host Migration. Gausss gauge in Redline had a puffy smoke effect on it. Fixed an issue where clicking the plus icon in the squad panel while in Solo mode gave two errors popups. Despite the fact that Clients are taking up Yareli, the Vacuum-like mods weren’t working all the time, so the customer is not able to ride Merulina. We became caught off, and became caught by motor motors when the bus stopped while driving into the map front of the Eidolon plains. The Teralyst is fixing the script error. Sometimes transmissions have been inoperable. Fixed the script error with the Aerolysts projectiles. The problem is that bosss can be triggered while a player is out of place as an Operator, locking them out of the game. Fixed animation issues where enemies wouldn’t turn back when they approached them. Fixed the possibility to dodge Trade Zone restrictions in the Maroos Bazaar around Varzia by jumping. We fixed-loading from Larvling in-mission to generate Kuva Lich weapons. Fixed Dojo Decorate Mode HUD legend only showing two options if opened through the Dojo console rather than the menu. In case of an incomplete Tenno guide, the missing prompts were repaired. When you can replicate Decorations, write error. Fixed several Armor angioplastys that scrounged through Nidus Kuvael Scrounger Skin. Fixed a harmful script error that could occur during the fight against the Exploiter Orb. The script bug could come up if you caught a fish soon after the migration. Fixed Deimos Claws Having the Skin ill appear in mission when equipped with Keratinos. Since you changed your Necramech weapon, the Archwing loadout doesn’t work. Fixed Juggernauts stomp no more attack spawning new enemies. Fixed that inability to place Decorations on the Codex table in the Orbiter would be good for that. When viewed from the front door into the room, noticed a flickering glass texture in one of the Corpus Outpost Spy windows of the central tower. Fixed chained mission in the Corps ship delaying the over-dark. We fixed the inability to view the codex which runs of the Railjacks and the Granums. Fixed a stalker spawning and pushing you into the other side of the tunnel. Having fixed and replete an enemy which was lost Xaku Gaze, Loki Radial Disarm, Baruuk deolates and serene Storm, Naramon Defensive, Gorilla Depression Magnetism, or Kubrow Neutralism puts an indebted attack on mission. Fixed multiple issues while clicking Quests in the Codex. Fixed Syndicate Relic Pack incorrectly stating a guaranteed Rare as it pulls the description from the market Relic Pack. Fixed Nightwave Act description for Day Trader claiming only 1 win is required when in fact it is 3. Fixed Titanias Razorwing kills on normal ground missions due to the advance of The From On High Challenge. The omission to use an ungilded moa instead of an ungilded hound was fixed in trying to polarize. Fixed Landing Craft Skin always means you don’t own that Landing Craft when you do, though. Fixed Augments are not being properly marked as the property of the Syndicate Offerings. Several Syandanas aren’t sitting on Railjack Crew members. If a hive the first step, dick the third round, then exhilarate the Necralisk. Adding the hoops to Equinox skin’s waist by the leg while installing on Equinox prime was fixed. If you were to hang out in the Cambion Drift, you removed the overly aggressive UI shake. Fixed the problem that I was unable to replicate the Ayatan Statues in the Dojo if there was any variation in the Vault. Fixed normal Star Chart nodes being locked after an event expires (e.g., Necralisk after Night of Naberus). Fixed Mods marked NEW throughout the mission, in addition to those who have lost the NEW tag on the end of the mission’s screen. Using one of Vors taunt Transmissions play two times in two different missions during a Presidency Quest. Tyl Regors Shield now has a Shield Regeneration delay of 2 seconds, compared with how it instantly regenerates now, thereby giving new players more chance.</p><p>Developers and players demanded that he remove spoilers, but they also remove spoilers.
Developers offer an Open Letter:
The New War comes to an end. The cinematic quest came together from all the people of our team and gathered from all over the world to bring it to you. Perhaps it was too long for some veteran Tenno, but it ended today.
After the beginning of the year 2018 we planned on the New War trailer. Over the course of the years, the events moved on and ended with some cryptic hints, and finally lock-down happened, which truly meant that a year back. This isn’t a great excuse, it’s a fact that deserves attention. We were planning to ship the cinematic quest experience much earlier, but the delays caused us, then the world’s delays were eventually here, but that ended now.
While we were waiting for our surprise, we could not end up with it. The Tenno story.
New War is the biggest in the history of Digital Extremes, and we also have new perspectives for our Tenno. It’s been many years since the Tenno realized a clear story point. We now have that long goal: to take the second dream and save it. If you have started the journey, you’ll have better planned it, so make sure you’re prepared.
The New War is here. The stage is going to be set for the future. So long as you’ve finished, join us in 2022 for the next Warframe in a post-New War world.
Tenno, thank you for your patience and kindness.
That’s a lot of new stuff! Let others know when the next title changes.
