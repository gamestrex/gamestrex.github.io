Once you complete ‘Sounds From Afar’, the first act of this event story quest, you will then gain access to the four mini-events that make up Of Ballad and Brews when each becomes available.\nOf Ballads and Brews rewards and Festive Fever explained Over the course of three days, four mini-events will become available in Mondstadt as part of the Of Ballads and Brews event. The first two of these mini-events, Autumn Crisis and Highwind Trial, are available from the first day Of Ballads and Brews starts, Thursday 29th September. Charity and Creativity then unlocks the next day at 3am (server time) on 30th September, and Fecund Blessings finally becomes available the day after that at 3am (server time) on 1st October. There’s also an event story quest called ‘Of Ballads and Brews’ that involves Razor and his lineage. Act 1 is available on the first day of the event, with Act 2 unlocking on Sunday, 2nd October, and Act 3 finally unlocking on Wednesday, 5th October. You’ll need to complete all three to complete the quest, but only need to do Act 1, ‘Sounds From Afar’, in order to gain access to the mini-events and their rewards. For completing challenges as part of the mini-events, and completing acts of Razor’s story quest, you’ll earn Festive Fever points. Earning enough Festive Fever is how you unlock the overarching rewards available in the event - just remember that you’ll also receive rewards for completing each challenge of the four mini-events. Once you have enough Festive Fever to get a reward, you’ll need to navigate to the ‘Events’ sub menu and press the button or touch the screen where your Festive Fever is displayed on the Of Ballads and Brews section. You can then claim any reward you have earned enough points to get. You have until Monday, 17th October to earn Festive Fever as part of the event, but you can still claim any rewards with Festive Fever you have left up until Monday, 24th October. Here’s every reward and how much Festive Fever you need to unlock it in Of Ballads and Brews:\nGenshin Impact Autumn Crisis rewards and challenges To start Autumn Crisis, follow the ‘Secret Forest Shadow’ World Quest to speak with Edmund, near Springvale, which is just south past the lake surrounding Mondstadt City. After speaking with Edmund, you’ll gain access to all Autumn Crisis challenges when they unlock:\nExpulsion - available from start of event Capture - unlocks Sunday, 2nd October at 3am (server time) Uproot - unlocks Wednesday, 5th October at 3am (server time)\nThe Expulsion challenge requires you to hit boars to earn points, but you can only use normal attacks, and must pick up buffs to strengthen your attacks. The bigger and tougher the boar you eliminate, the more points you will get at the end of the challenge. Here’s all the rewards available in the Expulsion challenge of Autumn Crisis: For the Capture challenge, you instead need to capture boars and other animals with a net to earn points. Here’s all the rewards available in the Capture challenge of Autumn Crisis: for the Uproot challenge, you need to defeat the Snowboar King boss by using both the hunting net and normal attacks. As well as the Hunter’s Shield that appears in the Expulsion challenge, traps, smoke machines, and lures will appear in Capture and Uproot to help you complete their challenges. Here’s all the rewards available in the Uproot challenge of Autumn Crisis:\nGenshin Impact Highwind Trial rewards and challenges To start Highwind Trial, follow the ‘Exemplary Adventurer’ World Quest to speak with Leni, near Springvale, which is just south past the lake surrounding Mondstadt City. After speaking with Leni, you’ll gain access to all Highwind Trial challenges when they unlock:\nFierce Combat Test - available from start of event Ambush Test - unlocks Sunday, 2nd October at 3am (server time) Endurance Test - unlocks Wednesday, 5th October at 3am (server time)\nAll three of these challenges are combat focused, and require you pick up green ‘Sublime Anemogranum’ buffs that are more effective at grouping enemies together the more you pick up, but you can only have up a maximum of three at a time. When you pick up at least one Sublime Anemogranum, you’ll group enemies with Anemo when you switch to another active character in your party. This is great for unleashing devastating elemental attacks on lots of enemies at once, while also applying Swirl to the Element you’re using. For this reason, you don’t really need to take an Anemo character with you for these combat challenges, unless you rely on their healing. You can access each stage of the challenges from the Of Ballads and Brews event menu, or you can use the wind currents that appear after each stage is completed to quickly travel to the next, with the fifth stage containing a boss enemy as well as grunts. Here’s all the rewards available in the Fierce Combat Test challenge of Highwind Trial: And here’s all the rewards available in the Ambush Test challenge of Highwind Trial: Finally, here’s all the rewards available in the Endurance Test challenge of Highwind Trial: Genshin Impact version 3.3 is here, with new codes, and new character Scaramouche (Wanderer), so find out where he’s placed on our tier list. You’ll need Primogems and luck of the Pity and 50/50 systems to Wish with Fate for him and other current and next banners. You’ll also need the right Adventure Rank for events. For more Sumeru help, we’ve got pages on Sumeru Reputation, Tree of Dreams, Dendroculus locations, the Aeonblight Drake boss, the Garden of Endless Pillars Domain, and locations for Nilotpala Lotus, Padisarah, Scarabs, and Redcrest.\rYou can also now unlock the Genius Invokation TCG and, if you want help building your deck, check out our Genius Invokation TCG Card List.\rIf you want to relax, however, why not try fishing at one of the many fishing spot locations?\nGenshin Impact Charity and Creativity rewards and challenges Charity and Creativity started on Friday, 30th September, with the Charity Alliance challenges unlocking at 3am (server time) on Monday, 3rd October - and the mini-event is a completely different experience than previous combat challenges, as it tasks you with opening and running a shop! For a complete guide on how the mini-event works, be sure to check out our Charity and Creativity customer cycle solutions page to ensure you get every reward. As a general summary to the mini-event, you have to complete some small quests after speaking with Bernhard in Springvale (south of Mondstadt City) to secure funds and actually get the shop up and running. When your shop is open, you’ll then have to manage your funds into three different priorities: product quality, business efficiency, and holistic service, while also employing Shop Stratagems. Adjusting these three sliders and Stratagems until they’re just right will result in you earning more ‘Business Earnings’. You’ll also be able to hire your Genshin Impact friends as assistants to help you out, and will eventually be able to run three shops at once after reaching certain milestones. Here’s every Genshin Impact Charity and Creativity reward:\nGenshin Impact Fecund Blessings rewards and challenges Fecund Blessings unlocks on Saturday, 1st October at 3am (server time), and this time, you’ll be going on a sort of treasure hunt, where you have to follow clues in order to locate ‘Fecund Hampers’ (chests) scattered about Teyvat. These hampers contain lots of different types of rewards, including decorations you can actually use to fulfil commissions for your shop in Charity and Creativity. We have a Fecund Hamper locations pages to help you get every reward!
