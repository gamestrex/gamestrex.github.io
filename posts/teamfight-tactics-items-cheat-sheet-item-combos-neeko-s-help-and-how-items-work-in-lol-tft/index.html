On this page: This page is up to date as of Patch 9.18. There are only two ways to get items in Teamfight Tactics: by picking a Champion from the carousel, such as at the start of the game because all Champions on the carousel will come with an item equipped; and at random, from defeated enemies in the PvE rounds. If you add two basic items to a Champion, such as a BF Sword and a Recurve Bow, those two will combine into an advanced item, in this case a Sword of the Divine. Avanced items provide both stat boosts and a unique secondary effect - in the Sword of the Divine’s case, that’s base stats of +15% Attack Speed and +15 Attack Damage (from the Recurve Bow and BF Sword respectively), plus the added effect where every second that passes the Champion holding the item has a 5% chance to gain 100% Critical Strike Chance until the end of combat. There are plenty of little subtleties though that you’re probably wondering about, so here’s a quick runthrough of the essentials: Key things to know about items:\nAny two basic items will form an advanced item when equipped on a Champion, there are no incompatible items or combos, so you can never have two basic uncombined items on one Champion. See the cheat sheet below for an at-a-glance look at what plus what equals what! You can equip a maximum of three advanced items on a Champion. When Champions are combined and are holding items, the items combine or stack, up to that total of three. If there would be more than three when the Champions are combined then the item is dropped and goes over to the bench, where you can reassign it. The only way to unequip an item from a Champion is to sell that Champion, or combine it with more of the same Champion so that there are more than three and the excess items drop to the bench. This is the only way to move items between Champions too. If you want to combine two items on a champ and it’s already got one different one on it, one workaround is to buy a champion you don’t want, combine them on that champ, then discard it to get the whole item and put that on the one you actually want it on.\nYou can view the details and effects of the item a Champion is holding by right-clicking on the Champion and then hovering the mouse over the items shown there. There’s no item shop or way you can choose items in the sense that you can view and choose Champions. The only time you can “choose” an item is when you’re choosing a Champion from the carousel, where you can see the item it currently has equipped. The items you get from defeating PvE enemies like minions or wolves are random. As far as we can tell so far there’s no way to influence this, so you need some luck!\nLoL Teamfight Tactics item cheat sheet:\nTFT item combos: what the new item Neeko’s Help does, and every Teamfight Tactics item’s stats Every item in Teamfight Tactics - barring the uncombined Golden Spatula - has a function. Basic items have a single function, such as +15 Attack Damage, whilst Advanced items have three: one for each of the two items that combined to make it, and a third unique bonus. Here’s a table running through every item in the game and what it does, so you know what to attach to who at any time! Combine this with the cheat sheet above for ultimate planning. Teamfight Tactics item list: item combos and what every item does in TFT Mobile users scroll right to view full table. That said, there are some standout items that are a bit less situational and can almost always be useful to your team, plus some that stand out as fairly meta-dominating from one patch to the next, that you should look to prioritise. Here are some of our go-to options from playing TFT so far. The best Teamfight Tactics items:\nForce of Nature (Golden Spatula + Golden Spatula) - The obvious one, Force of Nature is a game-changer, allowing you to field an extra Champion on the field above the usual limit of your level, including when you hit the cap at Level 9. The best way to get it is to pick champions you won’t use from the carousel who are carrying the Golden Spatula and then sell them, so you can combine it on a Champion of your choice. Easier said than done! Ionic Spark (Negaton Cloak + Needlessly Large Rod) - This is the ideal anti-Sorcerer item, and it’s stackable too. Fantastic on an AP-based carry for a team comp that’s weak to Sorcerers, like Varus, for instance. Morellonomicon (Giant’s Belt + Needlessly Large Rod) - Fantastic on bulkier, frequent ability-using carries, or ones that can hit multiple targets. Think Swain, Brand, Ahri, or even Cho’gath. The burn is real.\nRedemption (Tear of the Goddess + Giant’s Belt) - Another great utility item, this is an amazing item for champions you expect to be roughed up early in a round. The delay can be awkward and makes your positioning and which champ you use it on integral to your success, but even after tinkering in recent patches, it’s still a great option for your bruisers. Guinsoo’s Rageblade (Recurve Bow + Needlessly Large Rod) - Also another great carry item, put Guinsoo’s on a Shyvana, Varus, or Ashe in particular and you’ll be flying, especially if you can stack it with their attack speed-boosting traits. Avoid it on non ability-focused carries though - you’re better off giving them Rapid Firecannon and letting them sit safely in the corner. All of the double-stack items (Two of the same of any item) - Infinity Edge, Rapid Firecannon, Rabadon’s Deathcap, Seraph’s Embrace, Thornmail, Dragon’s Claw, and Warmog’s Armour are all brilliant single-purpose items for specialist builds. Get Warmog’s on your tank, Seraph’s on a caster, and so on. Combine them with at least one other advanced item and they can be devastating.\nAdditional reporting by Connor Makar.\n","wordCount":"1122","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-29T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"George Jones"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/teamfight-tactics-items-cheat-sheet-item-combos-neeko-s-help-and-how-items-work-in-lol-tft/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Teamfight Tactics Items Cheat Sheet Item Combos Neeko S Help And How Items Work In Lol Tft</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-29 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 29, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1122 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;George Jones</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#tft-item-combos-what-the-new-item-neekos-help-does-and-every-teamfight-tactics-items-stats>TFT item combos: what the new item Neeko&rsquo;s Help does, and every Teamfight Tactics item&rsquo;s stats</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Below we&rsquo;ll explain all you need to know about every TFT item, including the latest new item, Neeko&rsquo;s Help, as well as the item combos and a selection of what we think are the best items in the meta right now.
