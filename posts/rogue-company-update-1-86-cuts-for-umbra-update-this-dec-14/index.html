Favelas Players can stand on a concrete tree now.\nRogues\nAnvil Power goes away every 35 seconds now. There are two barricades that can be placed instantly in the world. Saint Drone now travels to her teammates 50% faster. After succeeding revitalize, the saints passive heal from succeeding. Now heals for 60 anstelle of 80 hem.

Level 2 upgrade doesn’t provide a reduction in reticle blooms anymore. The upgrade level 2 now increases the magazine size from 20 to 30. Red and raging a little tieoid. The HRM 30k is tuned to be a headshot gun through and through. We want to help players against an excessive reticle bloom when they are expected to hit headshots. We made the weapon more beautiful at the base and moved the bloom reduction upgrades to allow for more rapid access to your build. We believe that bullet penetration isn’t an alternative weapon to a weapon that can only be used in other ways. It is the only rifle that can be used to get a gun without the ability to upgrade your magazine size, except for the smallest magazines in class. We feel like the shabby with a large scale upgrade and not using bullet penetration will be more dependable than the shabby. A3 Salvo Range Base Range was lowered to 2 metres.
