Revisiting the same area again should result in smooth gameplay, leading many (possibly QA too?) to think that the problem is solved. The amount of replies we get about this issue (“the latest patch fixed it” or “smooth for me now” etc) doesn’t change the fact that first contact with any non-compiled shader will cause the issue. Can it be fixed? Absolutely - either by compiling shaders during load-time (The Ascent), compiling them before you even boot the game (Horizon Zero Dawn at launch) or compiling them in the background (Horizon Zero Dawn’s recent patch). Further options may be available, such as crowd-sourcing shaders on a platform like Steam, but ultimately, we can only hope that by highlighting this issue, it gets sorted, without recourse to Alex Battaglia launching an Angry Alex YouTube channel.\n00:00:00 Introductions 00:01:05 State of Play reactions 00:14:04 Horizon Forbidden West’s 1.07 patch 00:20:26 Dying Light’s next-gen patch 00:25:44 F-Zero X comes to Nintendo Switch Online 00:29:55 Media.Vision announces five games in development 00:31:38 Switch OLED 3600 hour burn-in test 00:38:31 DF Supporter Q: Do you think the ‘burn-in crisis’ is overblown? 00:42:37 DF Content Discussion: Guardians of the Galaxy on GamePass / DF Retro update 00:51:02 DF Supporter Q1/2/3: Elden Ring performance questions 00:58:35 Elden Ring PC patch early impressions 01:02:57 DF Supporter Q4: What would you prefer?

Yes, we wade through the expected Elden Ring performance enquiries, tackle the realistic results we can expect from DLSS on the mooted ‘Switch Pro’ and talk through frame-rate vs frame-time when you exceed 60 frames per second. Is 60-80fps (12.5ms to 16.7ms) with VRR better than a locked 60fps - a flat 16.7ms frame-time? We suggest not, but when you get to 80-100fps (10ms to 12.5ms), it’s a different story.
