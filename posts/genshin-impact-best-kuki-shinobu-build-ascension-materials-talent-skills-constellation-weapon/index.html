On this page:\nGenshin Impact Kuki Shinobu Talents, skills, rarity, element, and weapon Kuki Shinobu is a 4-Star Electro sword user best used in a support role while providing sub DPS Electro damage. She is the first Electro character in Genshin Impact to have a focus on healing.\rHere’s a summary of Kuki Shinobu’s abilities and stats in Genshin Impact:\nElement: Electro Rarity: 4-Star Weapon: Sword Banner: Oni’s Royale Best build: Healer and sub DPS Normal Attack: Shinobu’s Shadowsword Elemental Skill: Sanctifying Ring Elemental Burst: Gyoei Narukami Kariyama Rite Passive one: Heart’s Repose (Sanctifying Ring’s abilities will be boosted based on Shinobu’s Elemental Mastery, healing amount will be increased by 75% of Elemental Mastery while damage dealt is increased by 25% of Elemental Mastery) Passive two: Breaking Free (When Kuki Shinobu’s HP is below 50%, her Healing Bonus is increased by 15%) Expedition bonus: Protracted Prayers (gains 25% more rewards when dispatched on an Inazuma Expedition for 20 hours)\nKuki Shinobu Normal Attack: Shinobu’s Shadowsword Kuki Shinobu can perform up to four rapid strikes for her normal attack, with the third hit launching knives toward the surrounding enemies. Her charged attack is similar to many other sword users, allowing her to consume stamina to perform two rapid sword strikes.\nKuki Shinobu Elemental Skill: Sanctifying Ring Creates a Grass Ring of Sanctification at the cost of 30% of her current HP, dealing Electro damage to nearby opponents every one and a half seconds, while restoring HP for the active party member on the field within the ring. Lasts for 12 seconds, and has a 15 second cooldown. The HP consumption from using Sanctifying Ring can only bring Kuki Shinobu down to 20% of her maximum HP. The damage dealt from the AOE electro damage scales with Kuki’s maximum health.\nKuki Shinobu Elemental Burst: Narukami Kariyama Rite Kuki Shinobu stabs the ground, creating a field that deals continuous AOE Electro damage. Just like her Elemental Skill, the damage of Kuki’s Elemental Burst scales with her HP. The damage and duration is increased if Kuki has less than 50% HP when the Burst is activated.\nGenshin Impact Kuki Shinobu Talent materials To get the most out of using Kuki Shinobu, you will have to level her abilities up by using Talent materials, which vary from character-to-character.\rFor Kuki Shinobu, you’re going to need to farm a lot of Spectral and Elegance items (if you don’t already have them) to fully upgrade her healing and sub DPS capabilities. With thanks to honeyhunterworld for sourcing this information, the table below explains the Kuki Shinobu Talent materials and amount of Mora you need to improve one of her abilities.\rAs Kuki Shinobu has three Talents, you will have to spend three times the Talent materials listed below to fully upgrade all of her abilities.\nGenshin Impact Kuki Shinobu Ascension materials Just like Talents, you need to use Kuki Shinobu Ascension materials to upgrade her health, attack, defence, and critical hit effectiveness.\rFor Kuki Shinobu, you’re going to need to farm a lot of Runic Fang and Naku Weed materials (if you don’t already have them) to fully upgrade her Elemental Skill and Burst capabilities. Unlike Talent materials, you only need to spend the below Ascension materials once to fully raise Kuki Shinobu to her highest character level. There is also Acquaint Fate rewarded for reaching certain Ascension levels. You can spend this Fate on standard and beginner Banners to Wish for characters and weapons.\rWith thanks to honeyhunterworld for sourcing this information, the table below explains the Kuki Shinobu Ascension materials and Mora you need to upgrade Kuki Shinobu, and Fate rewards you gain from Ascension.\nGenshin Impact Kuki Shinobu Constellation By getting duplicates of Kuki Shinobu from wishing on Banners, you will receive her Stella Fortuna. This material allows you to unlock Constellation levels, with each upgrade either improving an existing Talent or Passive ability.\rHere are all of Kuki Shinobu’s Constellation level upgrades in Genshin Impact:\nTo Cloister Compassion (C1): Gyoei Narukami Kariyama Rite’s AOE is increased by 50%. To Forsake Fortune (C2): Grass Ring of Sanctification’s duration is increased by three seconds. To Sequester Sorrow (C3): Increases the level of Sanctifying Ring by three, with 15 being the maximum upgrade level. To Sever Sealing (C4): When the Normal, Charged, or Plunging attacks of the character affected by Shinobu’s Grass Ring of Sanctification hit opponents, a Thundergrass Mark will land on the opponent’s position and deal AOE Electro damage based on 9.7% of Shinobu’s Max HP. This effect can occur once every five seconds. To Cease Courtesies (C5): Increases the level of Gyoei Narukami Kariyama Rite by three. To Ward Weakness (C6): When Kuki Shinobu takes lethal damage, this instance of damage will not take her down. This effect will automatically trigger when her HP reaches 1 and will trigger once every 60 seconds. When her HP drops below 25%, she will gain 150 Elemental mastery for 15 seconds. This effect will trigger every 60 seconds.\nGenshin Impact version 3.3 is here, with new codes, and new character Scaramouche (Wanderer), so find out where he’s placed on our tier list. You’ll need Primogems and luck of the Pity and 50/50 systems to Wish with Fate for him and other current and next banners. You’ll also need the right Adventure Rank for events. For more Sumeru help, we’ve got pages on Sumeru Reputation, Tree of Dreams, Dendroculus locations, the Aeonblight Drake boss, the Garden of Endless Pillars Domain, and locations for Nilotpala Lotus, Padisarah, Scarabs, and Redcrest.\rYou can also now unlock the Genius Invokation TCG and, if you want help building your deck, check out our Genius Invokation TCG Card List.\rIf you want to relax, however, why not try fishing at one of the many fishing spot locations?\nBest Kuki Shinobu build in Genshin Impact Kuki Shinobu is suited to a healer role who provides some sub DPS support in team compositions. With her healing and skill damage based off of her maximum HP, you should focus on raising her maximum health and Energy Recharge as much as you can to get the most out of her abilities - similar to Yelan’s best build. Unlike Yelan, using Kuki Shinobu’s Elemental Skill actually drains her health - however this is actually a good thing, as her Elemental Burst damage and passive healing capabilities are boosted when she is below 50% HP.\rAs Kuki Shinobu won’t be your main damage dealer, we recommend pairing her with a high DPS Hydro character to create an Electro-Charged reaction. Ayato is who you should aim to pair her with, but Childe can fill this role too, and even Yelan if you’re running a DPS build on her. Additionally, Xingqiu is a decent 4-Star option, but he won’t be as good for your overall damage output.\rThe other two team members in your party aren’t as important as a high DPS Hydro user, but are needed to enhance Kuki Shinobu’s Electro damage. Another Electro character like Fischl or Raiden Shogun will help keep the elemental damage high, while an Anemo user like Kazuha or Sucrose will help group enemies together and spread the Electro-Charged damage.\rThe best Kuki Shinobu Artifacts in Genshin Impact for a healing and sub DPS build help raise her maximum HP and add elemental damage to her skill and burst Talents. You should aim for a four set Tenacity of the Millelith to increase Kuki Shinobu’s health by 20%, and increase the attack of party members by 20% when her Elemental Skill, Sanctifying Ring, is activated. Alternatively, anything with boosted HP and Energy Recharge will also help increase the party’s damage, and how often Kuki can use her Elemental Burst.\nBest Kuki Shinobu healer and sub DPS build With all this in mind, if you want to take advantage of her healing and sub DPS capabilities, we have compiled what we think is currently the best Kuki Shinobu build in Genshin Impact below:\nBest Weapon: Freedom-Sworn to increase other character’s damage or Sacrificial Sword for more energy recharge. Best Artifacts: x4 Tenacity of the Millelith set for more HP and increased attack, or x2 Ocean-Hued Clam set for increased healing capabilities. Best team members: A high DPS Hydro character (like Ayato or Childe), another Electro user to help with applying Electro damage (like Fischl or Raiden Shogun), and an Anemo character to help with grouping enemies and spreading Elemental damage (like Kazuha or Sucrose).\nIt can take a lot of time to find these Artifacts and Ascension/Talent materials to level-up Kuki Shinobu, but is worth the effort if you’re in need of an Electro team member with the ability to heal the party.\rGood luck levelling up Kuki Shinobu in Genshin Impact!\n","wordCount":"1566","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-15T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-15T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Heather Bowers"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/genshin-impact-best-kuki-shinobu-build-ascension-materials-talent-skills-constellation-weapon/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Genshin Impact Best Kuki Shinobu Build Ascension Materials Talent Skills Constellation Weapon</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-15 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 15, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1566 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Heather Bowers</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#genshin-impact-kuki-shinobu-talents-skills-rarity-element-and-weapon>Genshin Impact Kuki Shinobu Talents, skills, rarity, element, and weapon</a><ul><li><a href=#kuki-shinobu-normal-attack-shinobus-shadowsword>Kuki Shinobu Normal Attack: Shinobu&rsquo;s Shadowsword</a></li><li><a href=#kuki-shinobu-elemental-skill-sanctifying-ring>Kuki Shinobu Elemental Skill: Sanctifying Ring</a></li><li><a href=#kuki-shinobu-elemental-burst-narukami-kariyama-rite>Kuki Shinobu Elemental Burst: Narukami Kariyama Rite</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#genshin-impact-kuki-shinobu-talent-materials>Genshin Impact Kuki Shinobu Talent materials</a></li><li><a href=#genshin-impact-kuki-shinobu-ascension-materials>Genshin Impact Kuki Shinobu Ascension materials</a></li><li><a href=#genshin-impact-kuki-shinobu-constellation>Genshin Impact Kuki Shinobu Constellation</a></li><li><a href=#best-kuki-shinobu-build-in-genshin-impact>Best Kuki Shinobu build in Genshin Impact</a><ul><li><a href=#best-kuki-shinobu-healer-and-sub-dps-build>Best Kuki Shinobu healer and sub DPS build</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>The Arataki Gang deputy leader is included in the Oni&rsquo;s Royale Banner, with Arataki Itto as its featured 5-Star character.

The best Kuki Shinobu Artifacts in Genshin Impact for a healing and sub DPS build help raise her maximum HP and add elemental damage to her skill and burst Talents. You should aim for a four set Tenacity of the Millelith to increase Kuki Shinobu&rsquo;s health by 20%, and increase the attack of party members by 20% when her Elemental Skill, Sanctifying Ring, is activated. Alternatively, anything with boosted HP and Energy Recharge will also help increase the party&rsquo;s damage, and how often Kuki can use her Elemental Burst.</p><h3 id=best-kuki-shinobu-healer-and-sub-dps-build>Best Kuki Shinobu healer and sub DPS build<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-kuki-shinobu-healer-and-sub-dps-build>#</a></h3><p>With all this in mind, if you want to take advantage of her healing and sub DPS capabilities, we have compiled what we think is currently the best Kuki Shinobu build in Genshin Impact below:</p><p>Best Weapon: Freedom-Sworn to increase other character&rsquo;s damage or Sacrificial Sword for more energy recharge. Best Artifacts: x4 Tenacity of the Millelith set for more HP and increased attack, or x2 Ocean-Hued Clam set for increased healing capabilities. Best team members: A high DPS Hydro character (like Ayato or Childe), another Electro user to help with applying Electro damage (like Fischl or Raiden Shogun), and an Anemo character to help with grouping enemies and spreading Elemental damage (like Kazuha or Sucrose).</p><p>It can take a lot of time to find these Artifacts and Ascension/Talent materials to level-up Kuki Shinobu, but is worth the effort if you&rsquo;re in need of an Electro team member with the ability to heal the party.
Good luck levelling up Kuki Shinobu in Genshin Impact!</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Kuki-Shinobu-Genshin-Impact.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Kuki-Shinobu-Genshin-Impact.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact best Kuki Shinobu build  Ascension materials  Talent  skills  Constellation  weapon - 35"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Spectral-Nucleus.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Spectral-Nucleus.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact best Kuki Shinobu build  Ascension materials  Talent  skills  Constellation  weapon - 75"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Naku-Weed.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Naku-Weed.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact best Kuki Shinobu build  Ascension materials  Talent  skills  Constellation  weapon - 65"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Genshin-Impact-best-Kuki-Shinobu-build%2C-Constellation.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Genshin-Impact-best-Kuki-Shinobu-build%2C-Constellation.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact best Kuki Shinobu build  Ascension materials  Talent  skills  Constellation  weapon - 35"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Genshin-Impact-Kuki-Shinobu-Elemental-Skill-Burst.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Genshin-Impact-Kuki-Shinobu-Elemental-Skill-Burst.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact best Kuki Shinobu build  Ascension materials  Talent  skills  Constellation  weapon - 93"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Kuki-Shinobu-team-comp-Genshin-Impact.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Kuki-Shinobu-team-comp-Genshin-Impact.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact best Kuki Shinobu build  Ascension materials  Talent  skills  Constellation  weapon - 97"><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Flower-of-Accolades-Genshin-Impact.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Flower-of-Accolades-Genshin-Impact.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact best Kuki Shinobu build  Ascension materials  Talent  skills  Constellation  weapon - 27"></p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/genshin-impact-3-4-livestream-date-time-and-what-to-expect-from-3-4-banners/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Genshin Impact 3 4 Livestream Date Time And What To Expect From 3 4 Banners</span></a>
