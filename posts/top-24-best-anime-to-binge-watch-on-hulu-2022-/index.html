Otherwise, Hulu comes with a remarkable choice of anime from a variety of genres. Let’s catch with some of the best anime on Hulu.\nList Of Best Anime on Hulu (2022) 1. Attack on Titan (action-adventure) Attack on Titan depicts an action-adventure thriller and one of the most popular anime streaming on Hulu. It revolves around the last bastion of humanity and its war against the titans. It plays with the lives of many of its characters and the constant suspense makes it an engaging watch.\n2. My Hero Academia (action-adventure) My Hero Academia is an action thriller and one of the greatest show for the last half a decade. It deals with the story of a kid with zero powers who are then granted powers as a boon by none other than his hero. This Anime series taps extensively on themes like good and evil while also playing into the superhero culture that is in right now. The action sequences have hit the bullseye and the storytelling is on point.\n3. Black Clover (fantasy) Black Clover is a fantasy-based adventure show. It’s running currently but still consisted tons of episodes while in the process of writing. The story brings about two young men, one with great magic power and one with literally none. They both make their entry into The Magic Knights in hopes of becoming the Wizard King someday. Several people are referring to this as Fairy Tail Jr because of its similarity with magic users and guilds. Hulu has both subbed and dubbed versions, so the call is yours entirely.\n4. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (fantasy) Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is one of the most talked-about fantasy-adventure anime on Hulu. Set against the story of Elric brothers as they experiment with prohibited magic, unravel sinister plots, and hunt down the Philosopher’s Stone. It’s quite an old show but holds up well to current standards. Hulu doesn’t have the original Fullmetal Alchemist, unfortunately. You can find that one on Netflix in both subs and dubs, though.\n5. Girls und Panzer (slice-of-life and moe) Girls und Panzer is a cute little show about chicks who drive tanks for a school competition. Its focal point is more on interpersonal relationships than the actual story, but that’s kind of a trait of all kinds of life shows. Eventually, the season does get back slowly around the girls winning a national competition for their tank fighting skills. The series lasts for 14 episodes so it’s a quick watch. It’s only available with subtitles, though.\n6. K-On!! (slice-of-life and moe) K-On!! It is a slice-of-life show about four (eventually, five) girls in a school music club. They play music, eat cake, and strive to develop their interpersonal relationships. K-On is one of the anime held accountable for the massive popularity and success of the slice-of-life genre in Japan, so it’s an obvious choice for this list.\n7. Toradora! (drama and romance) Toradora! is a cute romantic drama about two people with crushes on different people. They try to set each other up with their crushes but all in vain most of the time. However, the characters start to bond because of the quality time they spend together. There is some slice of life elements as well, but romance is the big element here. It’s a well-paced show with some good humour and dialogues. Hulu only has the subtitled version and that’s an utter shame because a dubbed version does exist.\n8. Your Lie in April (drama and romance) Your Lie in April is a subtly penned romantic drama about a boy who plays the piano. He loses the thrill to continue playing it after his mom passes away but restores it after meeting Kaori, a violinist. Kaori has an extremely wild personality and wants to do nothing more than play the violin with our humble protagonist. The show runs for 22 episodes in full and it utilizes fully almost every episode to tell the story. It’s a must-watch for all romance fans.\n9. Food Wars (comedy) Food Wars is a hilarious drama about a teen who likes to make the best use of his culinary skills. He’s always searching for the best flavour combinations and enrols in a culinary school to enhance his skills. The story follows his adventures at the school and all of the drama that is associated with it. There are some truly humorous scenes in the show and its lighthearted nature makes it an easy watch.\n10. One Punch Man (comedy) One Punch Man is an action-comedy about a bald guy who knocks down everybody with a single punch. Despite all the chaos always around him, he usually doesn’t seem to want much to do with it. The comedy gold comes with the contrast of picking up a huge fight scene only to have Saitama destroy the villain in a single blow. Hulu has season 1 as well as season 2, something Netflix does not have yet.\n11. Danganronpa (mystery and thriller) Danganronpa is a mystery thriller with certain dim horror elements. A bunch of school kids are trapped in a game show where they must commit the perfect murder to set themselves free. They are monitored by Monobear, the game show’s host and main antagonist. The show holds few punches and is a good ride until the very end. It’s has its base set on a video game and there are several other entrants into the series.\n12. Death Note (mystery and thriller) Death Note is another popular anime streaming on Hulu. It’s a thriller compiled with mystery and horror elements. A student finds a notebook that kills people when their names are written in it. A good portion of the show revolves around on a cat-and-mouse hunt between a detective and the student. Netflix received widespread attention for doing a live-action remake, but the anime is available both there and on Hulu.\n13. Blood-C (horror and gore) Blood-C is one of the best Anime on Hulu. It is a gruesome action thriller with horror elements. Saya and her father defend a small, isolated town from a race of monsters that can possess inanimate objects and use them to kill people. Those who get an adrenaline rush with action, death, and destruction will almost certainly enjoy this one to the fullest if they can digest it. We don’t recommend this one to kids or anybody who gets dizzy at the sight of blood.\n14. Elfen Lied (horror and gore) Elfen Lied is a gory thriller with a hint of some horror elements. It follows the story of Lucy, a psychopathic killer possessing supernatural powers as well as a newly mutated race called Diclonius and a government conspiracy to get them bowled out. The anime also has dark fantasy and science fiction elements that helps to drive the narrative forward. Merely listing down only a dozen or so anime on this list was certainly tough, so here’s an expansive honourable mentions list with a bunch of other good anime on Hulu that may catch your attention. We wanted to include some shows such as Fairy Tail.\n15. Bleach Bleach is an older anime that showcased for a very long time. Hulu has all 366 episodes both subbed and dubbed, so we can’t recommend this one enough. The plot is quite long, but revolves around a man named Ichigo after he acquires powers of a Soul Reaper. It’s a classic action-adventure show.\n16. Gundam shows Gundam is the godfather of anime and Hulu has several shows from the legendary mecha-action franchise to its credit. Hulu has the rights to a bunch of Gundam shows, including Gundam 00, Gundam Wing, Gundam The 08th MS Team, Gundam Iron-Blooded Orphans, and the still-in-progress Gundam The Origin. Fans of mecha should definitely check those out.\n17. Kill la Kill Kill la Kill is an action-adventure anime with some dark plot twists. It follows the story of Ryoko and a sentient article of clothing she stumbles upon. She, along with some friends, take on a whole school of people in search of her father’s murderer. The art style is a tad polarizing, but the story is quite eye-grabbing.\n18. Madoka Magica Madoka Magica is one of the most iconic titles in the magical girl’s anime genre. It follows the story of Madoka and her friends as they make a wish and become magical girls. The first few episodes are adorable and sweet before the show takes a sudden and dark turn.\n19. No Game No Life No Game No Life is a “new world, new life” show similar to shows like Sword Art Online. It deals with two shut-ins as they beat a god in chess and are offered to live in a video game world. They choose to do so and there begins the adventure.\n20. Noragami Noragami revolves around the plight of a minor god who has almost no follower. He gives in to favours for five yen and befriends a young girl after an accident separates her soul from her body, but oddly doesn’t kill her. The action-adventure series also has some light-hearted elements, but it can turn on the suspense when it needs to.\n21. Parasyte Parasyte is a unique drama-thriller showcasing a race of parasites that invade in the middle of the night. One parasite didn’t get the memo and befriends his new host instead of just taking him over. The show revolves around Shinichi as he deals with one parasite as well as dealing with the other parasites. Some quote this as a horror show, but never really felt like one.\n22. Psycho-Pass Psycho-Pass is a thriller about future cops solving crimes. They end up hunting down Makishima, who is totally against how the police deal things with the Sibyl System. That conflict drives most of the first season.\n23. Spice and Wolf Spice and Wolf is an adventure-romance anime. It’s about a merchant named Kraft Lawrence who runs-in with a 600-year-old wolf god. She helps him and gets helped by Kraft. That’s the main narrative of the show. It focuses on issues like trade economics instead of the usual anime tropes like fighting and getting stronger, and that makes it a great watch.\n24. WataMote WataMote is slice-of-life satirical anime that pokes fun at other slice-of-life shows. It follows the life of Tomoko as she proactively despises the cutesy little things that girls do at her age while secretly wanting to do them as well. The show features dark comedy and cringes humour making it extremely fun to watch.\n25. Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure is the story of e Joestar family and their adventures as they go about life. The family is possessed with intense psychic strength and it leads to some pretty intense situations. It is truly a bizarre adventure that has divided viewers over whether they love it or hate it. We suggest you check it out for yourself before making up your mind. These are some of the best Anime series streaming on Hulu.

Hulu has season 1 as well as season 2, something Netflix does not have yet.</p><h3 id=11-danganronpa-mystery-and-thriller>11. Danganronpa (mystery and thriller)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#11-danganronpa-mystery-and-thriller>#</a></h3><p>Danganronpa is a mystery thriller with certain dim horror elements. A bunch of school kids are trapped in a game show where they must commit the perfect murder to set themselves free. They are monitored by Monobear, the game show’s host and main antagonist. The show holds few punches and is a good ride until the very end. It’s has its base set on a video game and there are several other entrants into the series.</p><h3 id=12-death-note-mystery-and-thriller>12. Death Note (mystery and thriller)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#12-death-note-mystery-and-thriller>#</a></h3><p>Death Note is another popular anime streaming on Hulu. It’s a thriller compiled with mystery and horror elements. A student finds a notebook that kills people when their names are written in it. A good portion of the show revolves around on a cat-and-mouse hunt between a detective and the student. Netflix received widespread attention for doing a live-action remake, but the anime is available both there and on Hulu.</p><h3 id=13-blood-c-horror-and-gore>13. Blood-C (horror and gore)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#13-blood-c-horror-and-gore>#</a></h3><p>Blood-C is one of the best Anime on Hulu. It is a gruesome action thriller with horror elements. Saya and her father defend a small, isolated town from a race of monsters that can possess inanimate objects and use them to kill people. Those who get an adrenaline rush with action, death, and destruction will almost certainly enjoy this one to the fullest if they can digest it. We don’t recommend this one to kids or anybody who gets dizzy at the sight of blood.</p><h3 id=14-elfen-lied-horror-and-gore>14. Elfen Lied (horror and gore)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#14-elfen-lied-horror-and-gore>#</a></h3><p>Elfen Lied is a gory thriller with a hint of some horror elements. It follows the story of Lucy, a psychopathic killer possessing supernatural powers as well as a newly mutated race called Diclonius and a government conspiracy to get them bowled out. The anime also has dark fantasy and science fiction elements that helps to drive the narrative forward.
Merely listing down only a dozen or so anime on this list was certainly tough, so here’s an expansive honourable mentions list with a bunch of other good anime on Hulu that may catch your attention. We wanted to include some shows such as Fairy Tail.</p><h3 id=15-bleach>15. Bleach<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#15-bleach>#</a></h3><p>Bleach is an older anime that showcased for a very long time. Hulu has all 366 episodes both subbed and dubbed, so we can’t recommend this one enough. The plot is quite long, but revolves around a man named Ichigo after he acquires powers of a Soul Reaper. It’s a classic action-adventure show.</p><h3 id=16-gundam-shows>16. Gundam shows<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#16-gundam-shows>#</a></h3><p>Gundam is the godfather of anime and Hulu has several shows from the legendary mecha-action franchise to its credit. Hulu has the rights to a bunch of Gundam shows, including Gundam 00, Gundam Wing, Gundam The 08th MS Team, Gundam Iron-Blooded Orphans, and the still-in-progress Gundam The Origin. Fans of mecha should definitely check those out.</p><h3 id=17-kill-la-kill>17. Kill la Kill<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#17-kill-la-kill>#</a></h3><p>Kill la Kill is an action-adventure anime with some dark plot twists. It follows the story of Ryoko and a sentient article of clothing she stumbles upon. She, along with some friends, take on a whole school of people in search of her father’s murderer. The art style is a tad polarizing, but the story is quite eye-grabbing.</p><h3 id=18-madoka-magica>18. Madoka Magica<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#18-madoka-magica>#</a></h3><p>Madoka Magica is one of the most iconic titles in the magical girl’s anime genre. It follows the story of Madoka and her friends as they make a wish and become magical girls. The first few episodes are adorable and sweet before the show takes a sudden and dark turn.</p><h3 id=19-no-game-no-life>19. No Game No Life<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#19-no-game-no-life>#</a></h3><p>No Game No Life is a “new world, new life” show similar to shows like Sword Art Online. It deals with two shut-ins as they beat a god in chess and are offered to live in a video game world. They choose to do so and there begins the adventure.</p><h3 id=20-noragami>20. Noragami<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#20-noragami>#</a></h3><p>Noragami revolves around the plight of a minor god who has almost no follower. He gives in to favours for five yen and befriends a young girl after an accident separates her soul from her body, but oddly doesn’t kill her. The action-adventure series also has some light-hearted elements, but it can turn on the suspense when it needs to.</p><h3 id=21-parasyte>21. Parasyte<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#21-parasyte>#</a></h3><p>Parasyte is a unique drama-thriller showcasing a race of parasites that invade in the middle of the night. One parasite didn’t get the memo and befriends his new host instead of just taking him over. The show revolves around Shinichi as he deals with one parasite as well as dealing with the other parasites. Some quote this as a horror show, but never really felt like one.</p><h3 id=22-psycho-pass>22. Psycho-Pass<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#22-psycho-pass>#</a></h3><p>Psycho-Pass is a thriller about future cops solving crimes. They end up hunting down Makishima, who is totally against how the police deal things with the Sibyl System. That conflict drives most of the first season.</p><h3 id=23-spice-and-wolf>23. Spice and Wolf<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#23-spice-and-wolf>#</a></h3><p>Spice and Wolf is an adventure-romance anime. It’s about a merchant named Kraft Lawrence who runs-in with a 600-year-old wolf god. She helps him and gets helped by Kraft. That’s the main narrative of the show. It focuses on issues like trade economics instead of the usual anime tropes like fighting and getting stronger, and that makes it a great watch.</p><h3 id=24-watamote>24. WataMote<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#24-watamote>#</a></h3><p>WataMote is slice-of-life satirical anime that pokes fun at other slice-of-life shows. It follows the life of Tomoko as she proactively despises the cutesy little things that girls do at her age while secretly wanting to do them as well. The show features dark comedy and cringes humour making it extremely fun to watch.</p><h3 id=25-jojos-bizarre-adventure>25. Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#25-jojos-bizarre-adventure>#</a></h3><p>Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure is the story of e Joestar family and their adventures as they go about life. The family is possessed with intense psychic strength and it leads to some pretty intense situations. It is truly a bizarre adventure that has divided viewers over whether they love it or hate it. We suggest you check it out for yourself before making up your mind.
