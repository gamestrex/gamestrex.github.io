If pure portability is essential, consider the Razer Blade. This ultra-thin laptop measures just 1.66 inches thick and is aimed at laying down the scales at approximately 3.8 pounds, making it much smaller than most computer-designed phones. However, Razer didn’t get the power to load the Blade 14, loaded with a high-performance CPU, an 8-core Ryzen 9 5900HX, Nvidias 8GB GeForce RTX 3080, an 1TB SSD and 16GB memory. You will give up some perks in exchange for Blades portability. This 14-inch screen is based on factory calibrated specs, but is 51201440 resolution. The 4K video editing isn’t connected to the tables, but the laptop doesn’t have a full DCI-P3 color gamut. Razers has an SD card slot, too. The Blade 14 is worth considering. Read our full list.

The AMD GE76 Raider, our favorite gaming laptop of 2021, was more fast in the ULs Procyon benchmark than any other notebook thanks to its large 8-core Core i7 chip, an accurrent RTX 3080 tuned for a blistering 165 watts and ample interior cooling. It even has a memory reader that can be built into the PCIe bus to transfer the card to high speed. The one downside is that the display is very large. The GE76 Raider was designed for gaming. It comes with a powerful 4K display with focus on color accuracy. If you pick this up, consider having it connected to a 4K monitor. This is a good thing for color-sensitive work.

The GeForce GTX 1650 Ti GPU and Core i5-1135G7 processor aren’t barnburners, but they’ll get the job done and at roughly $1,000 the price is right.

The most important thing to look for in a laptop in order to do video editing is its CPU and GPU. Your hardware is faster, but e-mails are faster. In addition to offering high-quality laptops to all the modern laptops up to our standard high-quality benchmarks, we also conducted the UL Procyon Video Editing Test on a variety of high-powered laptops. This was a squeaky task to see which hardware is the best for that job. The benchmark tasks include using the tool “Audio Premiere” to import two different video projects. The project uses a number of techniques to export images for the visual arts like color grading and transition, and then exporting them using H.264, H.265 at 1080p and 4K. Right-click the image in the new tab, and choose “Open”. Gordon Mah Ung / IDG. The best performance was made from large, heavy laptops running Intel’s latest 11th-generation processors. Of course, notebooks with AMD’s beefy Ryzen 9 processors came in just behind, while the 10th-generation Intel chips still gave a respectable score. All the best-performing laptops paired the Intel processors with Nvidia’s RTX 30-series GPUs, which isn’t surprising as both companies have spent a lot of time and money on optimizing Adobe performance. There is more attention to the GPU in Premiere, though more returns arrive soon. Computers that have top-tier RTX 3080 graphics are also faster at video editing than laptops which have more modest RTX 3060 graphics, but not by that much. If you look at the resonance of the Asus XPS 17 9710, its GeForce RTX 3060 GPU will probably be 14 percent faster than the fastest RTX 3080 in the MSI GE76 Raider. That isn’t much, especially if it comes to the huge scale and thick of the GE76 Raider, comparisons to Dell’s laptop. In general, it is preferred to have any sort of discrete graphics, with at least an RTX 3060 recommended for serious video editing. Video editing is very much needed for workflows. Your work and your tool may be more CPU-intensive or less flexible than Premiere. If so, adjust your priorities accordingly. The choices above all should be good well-rounded, though. Intel and Nvidia have spent years developing tools such as Quick Sync and CUDA respectively. Those many video editing apps can see significant speed increases because of that. If you don’t have strong reasons to recomend to AMD hardware, we’ll recommend that you stick to Intel and Nvidia as a result of a vendor’s specific software optimization. If you are transferring video from a camera, you should get an SD card (like this one on the Dell XPS 17), if you are comfortable with plugging a USB or Thunderbolt cable into an old-fashioned USB port. Gordon Mah Ung/IDG. However, it’s not confined to one’s body. The director of PCWorld says that an ideal laptop for editing video is a SD card reader which can save video from the camera. He recommends you to opt for a notebook that consists of 4K, 60Hz speaker and many-fast 1080p panels used by gaming laptops who would otherwise be perfect for video editing. I need a 4K-panel that is able to edit 4K videos well, and blazing-fast refresh rates are often expensive, like games. If it’s important to youit may not be true if you don’t create just casual videos for your personal YouTube channel, but if you don’t make your own personal videos for example, for example, support for the full DCI-P3 color gamut is a must, besides Delta E \u003c two color accuracy. For gaming applications, there are many types of specifications and specifications available for (or supported by) gaming, but dedicated content creation requires that information. This laptop’s color-correction provides a great solution for digital production. If you’re looking for a more general purpose notebook, please read our guide to the best laptops available in terms of the budget. Our top laptop deals range from $9 to $5.\n","wordCount":"1517","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-05T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-05T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Raymond Ford"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/one-of-the-best-laptops-for-video-editing/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>One Of The Best Laptops For Video Editing</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-05 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 5, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1517 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Raymond Ford</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#1-dell-xps-179710-the-best-laptop-for-video-editing>1.

The best performance was made from large, heavy laptops running Intel’s latest 11th-generation processors. Of course, notebooks with AMD’s beefy Ryzen 9 processors came in just behind, while the 10th-generation Intel chips still gave a respectable score. All the best-performing laptops paired the Intel processors with Nvidia’s RTX 30-series GPUs, which isn’t surprising as both companies have spent a lot of time and money on optimizing Adobe performance.
There is more attention to the GPU in Premiere, though more returns arrive soon. Computers that have top-tier RTX 3080 graphics are also faster at video editing than laptops which have more modest RTX 3060 graphics, but not by that much. If you look at the resonance of the Asus XPS 17 9710, its GeForce RTX 3060 GPU will probably be 14 percent faster than the fastest RTX 3080 in the MSI GE76 Raider. That isn’t much, especially if it comes to the huge scale and thick of the GE76 Raider, comparisons to Dell’s laptop.
In general, it is preferred to have any sort of discrete graphics, with at least an RTX 3060 recommended for serious video editing.
Video editing is very much needed for workflows. Your work and your tool may be more CPU-intensive or less flexible than Premiere. If so, adjust your priorities accordingly. The choices above all should be good well-rounded, though. Intel and Nvidia have spent years developing tools such as Quick Sync and CUDA respectively. Those many video editing apps can see significant speed increases because of that. If you don’t have strong reasons to recomend to AMD hardware, we’ll recommend that you stick to Intel and Nvidia as a result of a vendor’s specific software optimization.
If you are transferring video from a camera, you should get an SD card (like this one on the Dell XPS 17), if you are comfortable with plugging a USB or Thunderbolt cable into an old-fashioned USB port.

However, it’s not confined to one’s body. The director of PCWorld says that an ideal laptop for editing video is a SD card reader which can save video from the camera. He recommends you to opt for a notebook that consists of 4K, 60Hz speaker and many-fast 1080p panels used by gaming laptops who would otherwise be perfect for video editing. I need a 4K-panel that is able to edit 4K videos well, and blazing-fast refresh rates are often expensive, like games. If it’s important to youit may not be true if you don’t create just casual videos for your personal YouTube channel, but if you don’t make your own personal videos for example, for example, support for the full DCI-P3 color gamut is a must, besides Delta E &lt; two color accuracy.
For gaming applications, there are many types of specifications and specifications available for (or supported by) gaming, but dedicated content creation requires that information. This laptop’s color-correction provides a great solution for digital production.
If you’re looking for a more general purpose notebook, please read our guide to the best laptops available in terms of the budget.
