With the most beloved book character in Scholastic, Clifford is going to teach the world to love big! The Big Red Dog Sequel: in Development at Paramount Pictures. ComingSoon Editor-in-Chief Tyler Treese spoke withClifford’s Big Red Dog star Tony Hale on how to play a villain, his appearance on The Sopranos and many more. Corey:I thought the character was a sexy villain because he is trying to solve hunger and create a sustainable food, but his priorities are clearly just for profit. How do you ultimately see her? Because real life, many people say the potential of the good is greater than this cute, pretty red dog. Don’t you know who you mean, you have lots of motivation? Don’t you think that he’s a bad guy, but I thought of it with a good reason when playing him, but I found something to connect to him or maybe you only play a villain? And I realized that he is building this company. He was watching it fall apart. This all comes from anxiety. I’ve been feeling anxiety. Now I’m kind of connected with it, like that as hell, everything is going to slip. I just went that line, but yeah, he didn’t care about that. Even after fixing hunger, it was just for profit and he was the worst, but so fun. The CEO of a tech company is a very modern villain. It isn’t like twirling your mustache. What did you think of the role the most interesting? We see so many of those real-life tech CEOs being a villain, so why have there real-life inspirations? I don’t know what the real life life likes are, but I know that interestingly enough, and, for the first time, I have since just gotten into this new one because I wanted to say that it was that the love that made Clifford huge. I was essentially just breaking everyone off on social media. Everyones talking and thinking, Oh, if we scream at them, ‘and that’s all right’s gonna bring change, and its kind of that’s not going to bring change. That’s not going to do anything. You have to give people space, love, and understand and listen. My character is like the smarter. My character is the head of this tech company. All technology isn’t bad because it was used to be good, but because of that, you know, its huge noise. Love and understanding are not often spoken. John Cleese is the titular film of a comedy legend, and in the end, he’s obviously a legend. I know you don’t really directly interact with him much in the film, but did you find out about him at the moment or doing press? I did right. It was really hard to fanboy because I raised a little more money on Monty Python and although there was a broad comedy, they also had a lot of fun in their performances. Well I remember we were going to the van and my scene was shot somewhere else than his, but I was just trying to look at him and I knew he was OK, settle down. But I was just like John Cleese. That’s John Cleese. I mean, I was just trying to be completely silent. Yeah. I’m sorry you don’t want to look through a tidbit of sketchy in the current era. There’s also been a lot of temptation. Totally. Yeah. You’re sure. You’ll be like, Okay, let’s talk about another thing. I’ve talked about that for fifty-five years. So what do you think of Clifford? Did you read the books when you were young and was something you could share them with your daughter? Well, Clifford started, I think, it’s 1968 and maybe I was born in 1970. So Cliffords have been around since I was around. That is how Clifford lived around my daughter, and the film contains that kind of message that I believe in, that I was telling you about, but in the books there was just always something pretty cool about here, such a massive red dog that ran around with all the kids and nobody thought it was weird. No one looked like this freak. Talk about acceptance. It was like, well, thats Clifford. So I think that message was indebted, and you know, so is the author? You’ll see Clifford in this live-action setting because it makes you think about just taking care of an enormous dog. If you find a scene, then he poked in, so what is the thing about it, please? Like that blew my mind. It makes you think about it differently. Everything is different. I have such admiration for just special effects. So that’s how do you get a dog into New York, spanning bridges, etc. and making it look real? You don’t even have my eyes on it. I could not comprehend it. And you know all that fun stuff around the park and the ball, and his scope in New York is just so crowded. I mean it is a lot of work, such a big work. There are many wonderful young actors in this movie, and while I saw The Mysterious Benedict Society and a few other young girls in that list, there are all the great guys. How rewarding is working with that talented talent? I just was very impressed. At that age, I always think, gosh. I wasn’t really so mature at that age. Like Darby who plays the lead in Clifford, you are really grounded and kind, obviously. I was just like, I think all I wanted was in the mall a very young age. I did not have such a drive; I was a little embarrassed. I don’t know anything. I’m really respecting her and then my kids are working with Mysterious Benedict Society. That’s really amazing. In Benedikt Society, you play two characters. You said you play two characters in Hocus Pocus 2. What’s your strategy for splitting multiple roles? It’s fun. The Mysterious Benedict Society was challenging, but again, it was so a kind of thing that when playing twin brothers, the temptation is to go to like good brother, evil brother, rather than broken. Both of them misunderstood, both have stuff all that are going to stem from, and you only had to. We had to dig a little deeper or again, so I would be playing this superficial idea of them. It’s a lot like you do anything. While a rant of the earthquake looks like everyone is watching The Sopranos, and you don’t appear in Season 3 because you don’t even know what you like in the day. What did you take up this experience, right? Dude, I was terribly worried about it. In order to become here, I was really like you. Because I did mainly commercials, this was my first TV tv gig. I remember that nurse oncologist gave chemo, and when the nervousness fades, my hands will shake. It is a type of house where my nerves will form. I remember holding a tube and I felt like I was a slave. My hands will vibrate on camera, and Uncle Juniors will look like. Look at this guy and look who gives me chemo. We was just so proud that I was. You have been doing so much of the work you’ve done from Thomas the Tank Engine to Toy Story. Has your approach changed? Did you learn any lessons he did that? That’s a good question. I think, having done thankfully so much, I’m really grateful for that. My practice is more free since I had lots of anxiety coming to it, because being a physical comic, I was thinking, gosh, how did you translate that into a microphone? You can then simply give the spectacle as you would on camera as you would in front of a microphone, and then trust it to transfer this into the microphone. I think I got some more into the house and experimented so I didn’t judge myself. But when it happens, I’m thinking it takes time. I’ve seen you since those two of us work in many projects. I assume you prefer to be busy. What projects can you take? Do you ever say anything? Saying no is a challenge. The answer is a challenge. I mean, there have been other things that I was offered that I had to pass on for various reasons, but when you really like something and believe it, is hard. It’s really hard to say no. And when I have really loved something that I have not said because I have a family, but also because I just wanted to do something that has the hardest part, was allowing for that to go. They were freelancers. Artists are freelancers. Don’t say no. There are many good physical comedy here. Is there a favorite scene to film in Clifford? Love the show? Man, I must be honest. I’d say that most of them were my favorite thinking back just because it was pre-COVID [laughs]. You look like an idiot, I just used to take such a good part. I would see people’s faces. You don’t hear anything, Cut! and then everybody puts on a mask. Since I was not in the form of Mysterious Benedict Society for five months, I hadn’t seen anybody’s face. We never saw anyone’s face; I didn’t even really take it for granted. I would say the best part is that I really enjoyed working with Jessica Keenan Wynn and Alex Moffat in the lab. Alex is obviously from SNL. We just had a nice time. Anytime you can work with other comic actors and just come up with silly stuff, that’s just kind of playtime. It was very fun.\n","wordCount":"1701","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-10T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Emilie Cannon"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/clifford-the-big-red-dog-interview-tony-hale-is-playing-the-evil-tech-ceo-a-game/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Clifford The Big Red Dog Interview Tony Hale Is Playing The Evil Tech Ceo A Game</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 10, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1701 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Emilie Cannon</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>When middle schooler Emily Elizabeth meets an exceptional animal rescuer who can give her a tiny red puppy, she never anticipated waking up to find a giant ten-foot hound in her small New York apartment.
