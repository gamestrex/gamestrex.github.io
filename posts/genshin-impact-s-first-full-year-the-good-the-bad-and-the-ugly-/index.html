The developers continued to add new characters, features, seasonal events and regional updates. All of the new updates were built around Japan’s Inazuma region, while the seasonal activities influenced the game to keep the player from getting used to the long haul. Fan creators and community members were integral to keeping Genshin relevant, but not always in the best interest. Although the pandemic slowed development on other games, Genshin was releasing steady updates every three to four weeks. Like other AAA studios, miHoYo had an experience developing a variety of live-service games, like Honkai Impact. In the Northern region, seasonal events were delayed without a major delay. And neither did miHoYo neglect the older regions that helped popularize the game; Mondstadt and Liyue city were the first to receive regular events with new plays like Rosaria, Eula, Shenhe and Yun Jin. The content in the Inazuma region is strong, but miHoYo’s value is not only good, it is also really about a game, it is also very realistic. This year I spent less than a hundred dollars on Genshin. Some players spent a lot more, while others weren’t. It keeps a lot of players back. Sometimes players are backed up by an adaptation of their meta or new interesting characters. And miHoYo needs to fulfil all of these playerbases with just one try. Has it been working? The answer is simple. I was happy with many of the changes and additions, but I felt a sense of tension between keeping fun challenges seasonal to ensure that players have the right to play and improve their quality of life in the entire playerbase. And the players aren’t just passive consumers. They had many thoughts this year about how Genshin should be executed, and they certainly weren’t quiet about it. Here’s my list of what to know about the year in Genshin: the time when you met me.\nThe Good A new, explorable region. The defining Genshin update of 2021 came in July, when patch 2.0 added the sprawling new Inazuma region – full of new characters, quests, puzzles, furniture, food and a banging soundtrack – with tons of new characters, quests, puzzles, and puzzles. Japanese philosophy and theology were well redeemed; even Japanese players praised Inazuma for its accuracy. For more information about the islands, see the detailed questions you’ve got.\nThe housing system is building. You won’t ever have to queue up for a house in Genshin Impact (I’m so sorry, FFXIV players). Under the Serenitea housing system introduced in late April, every player has their own small pocket size so they can decorate as they look fit. Of course, this meant that players also needed to learn a whole new crafting system. Although I initially found the resourcehunt a little annoying, I started to see older regions as more attractive. I would like to complete the IKEA range for furniture pieces that are different types of wood, so I had to focus on specific trees. As soon as I realized that I could grow lumber from fruit trees that I ignored, I began to experience depression. With every update, the developers continued adding some new items to Serenitea. Players can garden, create obstacle courses, and collect new furniture with every major update. Some crafty players created a special glitch for enormous structures like these dinosaurs.\nEven though it became less difficult, the events became less hectic. This falls Moonchase Festival was just fine, but I appreciated that I didn’t grind the event very often like the most usual gacha games. I’ve just finished several quests all a few days, then walked off. The subsequent Shadows Around Snowstorms and Bantan Sango Case Files events followed the similar pattern. They didn’t finish some older quests because of their hardiness, so I still got angry about them. Gacha-style games aims to maximize the time you spend during your games. Playing streak rewards are common, and players aren’t very special about having to miss a single day. A newer Genshin event also cannot result in repeated logins for a single-term event or endgame order grind. Since it was designed to monopolize our time, miHoYo refused to give any hints to the player but instead acted in the favor of losing its ability to overcome any obstacles. I hope to see other gacha games (and live-service titles in general) taking care of Genshins success and follow suit.\nThe meta increased to accommodate the defence and the healing of wounds. The Genshin meta was dominated almost immediately by the high-attack and high-critical DPS characters. Several players built their characters using elemental reactions to the force of a vape effect. But the strategy for endgame content was used for much more than once. The developers tried to do that by introducing Sangonomiya Kokomi. Despite the controversy of her no-crit playstyle, her addition was the beginning of a new healing meta. As a result of an increasing prevalence of shield-ignoring enemies, healers are a much more desirable addition to DPS-heavy rosters. The old Inazuma characters Arataki Itto and Gorou scale off defense and a free Albedo-themed sword helped to make the characters defensive playstyle viable. Inazuma also introduced new defense and healing items that boosted DPS numbers. All of these tiny adjustments revitalized a support character with the move a long time.\nThe community is vibrant with fan-made content. While miHoYo has always conducted fanart contests and other creation-based events, the announcement of its official fan merchandising policy in May was a crucial moment for Genshin fan artists. According to the policy, creators could create commercial fan merchandise without worrying about copyright infringement or lawsuits, a thing that is not similar to the most licensed property. With this, so far, the fan merchandise created has been sloppy, such as cardigans, jewelry, and even condoms. It was a free market, which dominated the big public, and artistic artists could receive compensation for their work legally. As of now, these protections extended to fanfiction writers, too. After years of watching fan creators chirping around corporate lawyers, it was really interesting to see the owner of a major IP expanding legal protections to his creator community.\nThe Bad Artifact farming still has a lot of fun. After miHoYo took so many steps to reduce event grinding, I was hoping that it would also put out some kind of system to relieve our equipment drop-rate pain. It has to continue. It’s not correct that I can spend a week grinding and not make a good point for a small part of my principal dPS. Without a doubt there’s no problem to mechanics in ensuring certain artifacts appear, such as you can with certain weapons or character pulls. There’s an artifact exchange system, but it’s available only for four artifacts that have 20 pieces. Oh, and you are still in prison for what specific piece you get. Whether you’re free-playing or somebody who spends hundreds of dollars in Genshin, those two were bound by the same terrible drop rate. At least I have one thing in common with the whales and content creators who can afford to provide all the character.\nThe storyline Inazuma doesn’t live up to hype. I still mourn the terrifying villain that the Raiden Shogun could’ve been or the wonderful general that Sangonomiya Kokomi never was. The side-quests teased the larger guerrilla war that played offscreen, but the main quest drama felt very safe. That animation was better than ever, but it was the worst of mine, the end of the battle against the resurrected sea god Osial. After the first half, Narrative stakes were established and then discarded. The electro archon should’ve been held accountable in a way or another for her actions. Instead of ignoring underlying tensions or resolving the antagonists mistakes, the plot seemed to be swept all over the war. Seasonal story quests and side content prove that Genshin can rely on hard-hitting emotional content. It has to keep committing to its own ideas.\nNo endgame does continue if players don’t want to play the Spiral Abyss game. The Spiral Abyss is a challenge mode where players can clear room within a set timeframe, thus making it difficult to solve a problem. Clearing was partially about strategy, but mostly about how much time you invested in building your characters, which is a bit boring for us who are more interested in skill-based challenges. Genshin needs a sweet spot between casual enjoyer and a mshessy pom. Labyrinth Warriors could’ve been it, if only it was a seasonal event. This roguelike challenge mode introduced in the fall, presented the player with procedurally generated rooms in which they used random power-ups to avoid environmental hazards. Food wasn’t permitted, so you should avoid wasting money, either by taking medication or by using a medication. These challenging rooms were the hardest to solve while the main storyline were the most difficult of all time. As someone who has a lot of character-sized characters, I am happy to have a challenge that tested gameplay ability more than grind dedication. Unfortunately, it wasn’t quite possible for a long time. I continue to build my characters in hopes that my teams can have the latest Spiral Abyss flooring.\nThe Ugly Genshin is like anyone else. Most of the players are casual fans who don’t spend time fighting about characters online (thank god for that). If the dedicated gamers do, there was plenty of drama that would send Genshin topics to trend for hours, sometimes days. There were some of the most famous controversies including…\nAnniversary rewards Though content creators and general malaise led to surprise, the Genshin community was concerned when they realized that the free rewards for the games anniversary was much lower than expected. The forums and subreddits were floodbed with complaints, leading to free speech bans in any case regarding anniversary rewards. The discontent was so bad that the players began to review other games to complain about the stinginess of Genshin’s anniversary rewards. Not even Google Classrooms were spared. A set of premium wings and additional octogenium currency was distributed to players in order to stop the anger, and they look dehydrated now.\nElon Musk had a collaboration that never happened. In a bizarre twist I can confidently say no one saw coming, the English Genshin Impact Twitter account attempted to become more followers for a fan content account by claiming to collaborate with Elon Musk. The community outcry was so negative that miHoYo deleted the tweet a few hours later. Many fans felt that the supposed Musk collaboration showed that miHoYo doesn’t really understand its community, as long as fans like him for justifiable reasons.\nThe leakers hunt decree. The crackdown on Genshin leakers continued in 2021, a long time after miHoYo continue to enforce legal crackdowns on data mining and beta test leakers. Despite all its efforts, unreleased game content continued to spread on social media up to a few weeks before it was officially released. I wondered whether miHoYo did take the time to look at the original characters.\nWe see what the future has to be done. Despite everything happening over the last year, Im optimistic about the willingness of developers to support older content while creating new worlds. There were tons of small, barely noticeable tweaks that didn’t make it into the official patch notes, and I expect more of them to follow in the future. We had a house, and we’d gotten home. We’ve got a whole fishing system. There are minigames that wouldn’t be ideal for an open-world game at first glance. So glad I tried to give him a pull. I feel like that the Theater mechanic will likely be returning for the third year of Lantern Rite. But what I’m the most excited about most are the future additions that I didn’t know I wanted. Genshin is a game that can turn the head over one leaked or a behindscreen voiceline (looking at you, Kamisato Ayato). The idea of playing in Genshin is half of the experience and we’ve got plenty of crumbs to follow. Anyone who played to the end of the Inazuma chapter knows that well be exploring the new Sumeru region soon, and im a little worried about the fact that a nation founded on Asia’s Southwest, South Asia and North Africa has just shown us light-skinned NPCs so far. I hope that this is something that they will end up addressing in future updates, especially since colorism is a problem which has already been discussed widely in the Genshin community. But I have seen what happens when a community gets heated over unreleased content. Sumeru may be really good. It could be terrible for me. But none of us will know until version 3.0 comes, likely sometime next year. Although most AAA studios are struggling to develop games during the pandemic, miHoYo has already had the live-service schedule fixed. So far, all the questions that were presented in the launch preview have been answered in the main quest line. The community can anticipate teased content for months because miHoYos are consistent in delivering content that meets or exceeds its expectations. While miHoYo repeated a few mistakes in the Inazumas execution, Genshin continued to hit the tenth meter with every major update. The games have been very successful first year of play. This means that the excitement of Genshin is unlikely to be getting bored early.\n","wordCount":"2273","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-11T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-11T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Yvette Jackson"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/genshin-impact-s-first-full-year-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Genshin Impact S First Full Year The Good The Bad And The Ugly</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-11 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 11, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2273 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Yvette Jackson</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#the-good>The Good</a><ul><li><a href=#a-new-explorable-region>A new, explorable region.</a></li><li><a href=#the-housing-system-is-building>The housing system is building.</a></li><li><a href=#even-though-it-became-less-difficult-the-events-became-less-hectic>Even though it became less difficult, the events became less hectic.</a></li><li><a href=#the-meta-increased-to-accommodate-the-defence-and-the-healing-of-wounds>The meta increased to accommodate the defence and the healing of wounds.</a></li><li><a href=#the-community-is-vibrant-with-fan-made-content>The community is vibrant with fan-made content.</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#the-bad>The Bad</a><ul><li><a href=#artifact-farming-still-has-a-lot-of-fun>Artifact farming still has a lot of fun.</a></li><li><a href=#the-storyline-inazuma-doesnt-live-up-to-hype>The storyline Inazuma doesn’t live up to hype.</a></li><li><a href=#no-endgame-does-continue-if-players-dont-want-to-play-the-spiral-abyss-game>No endgame does continue if players don’t want to play the Spiral Abyss game.</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#the-ugly>The Ugly</a><ul><li><a href=#anniversary-rewards>Anniversary rewards</a></li><li><a href=#elon-musk-had-a-collaboration-that-never-happened>Elon Musk had a collaboration that never happened.</a></li><li><a href=#the-leakers-hunt-decree>The leakers hunt decree.</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#we-see-what-the-future-has-to-be-done>We see what the future has to be done.</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>It has been a little over a year since miHoYo launched Genshin Impact, and, in that time, the game proved no one was a single-off fluke (or a Breath of the Wild clone).

After years of watching fan creators chirping around corporate lawyers, it was really interesting to see the owner of a major IP expanding legal protections to his creator community.</p><h2 id=the-bad>The Bad<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-bad>#</a></h2><h3 id=artifact-farming-still-has-a-lot-of-fun>Artifact farming still has a lot of fun.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#artifact-farming-still-has-a-lot-of-fun>#</a></h3><p>After miHoYo took so many steps to reduce event grinding, I was hoping that it would also put out some kind of system to relieve our equipment drop-rate pain. It has to continue. It’s not correct that I can spend a week grinding and not make a good point for a small part of my principal dPS.
Without a doubt there’s no problem to mechanics in ensuring certain artifacts appear, such as you can with certain weapons or character pulls. There’s an artifact exchange system, but it’s available only for four artifacts that have 20 pieces. Oh, and you are still in prison for what specific piece you get. Whether you’re free-playing or somebody who spends hundreds of dollars in Genshin, those two were bound by the same terrible drop rate. At least I have one thing in common with the whales and content creators who can afford to provide all the character.</p><h3 id=the-storyline-inazuma-doesnt-live-up-to-hype>The storyline Inazuma doesn’t live up to hype.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-storyline-inazuma-doesnt-live-up-to-hype>#</a></h3><p>I still mourn the terrifying villain that the Raiden Shogun could’ve been or the wonderful general that Sangonomiya Kokomi never was. The side-quests teased the larger guerrilla war that played offscreen, but the main quest drama felt very safe. That animation was better than ever, but it was the worst of mine, the end of the battle against the resurrected sea god Osial. After the first half, Narrative stakes were established and then discarded. The electro archon should’ve been held accountable in a way or another for her actions. Instead of ignoring underlying tensions or resolving the antagonists mistakes, the plot seemed to be swept all over the war.
Seasonal story quests and side content prove that Genshin can rely on hard-hitting emotional content. It has to keep committing to its own ideas.</p><h3 id=no-endgame-does-continue-if-players-dont-want-to-play-the-spiral-abyss-game>No endgame does continue if players don’t want to play the Spiral Abyss game.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#no-endgame-does-continue-if-players-dont-want-to-play-the-spiral-abyss-game>#</a></h3><p>The Spiral Abyss is a challenge mode where players can clear room within a set timeframe, thus making it difficult to solve a problem. Clearing was partially about strategy, but mostly about how much time you invested in building your characters, which is a bit boring for us who are more interested in skill-based challenges. Genshin needs a sweet spot between casual enjoyer and a mshessy pom.
Labyrinth Warriors could’ve been it, if only it was a seasonal event. This roguelike challenge mode introduced in the fall, presented the player with procedurally generated rooms in which they used random power-ups to avoid environmental hazards. Food wasn’t permitted, so you should avoid wasting money, either by taking medication or by using a medication. These challenging rooms were the hardest to solve while the main storyline were the most difficult of all time. As someone who has a lot of character-sized characters, I am happy to have a challenge that tested gameplay ability more than grind dedication.
Unfortunately, it wasn’t quite possible for a long time. I continue to build my characters in hopes that my teams can have the latest Spiral Abyss flooring.</p><h2 id=the-ugly>The Ugly<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-ugly>#</a></h2><p>Genshin is like anyone else. Most of the players are casual fans who don’t spend time fighting about characters online (thank god for that). If the dedicated gamers do, there was plenty of drama that would send Genshin topics to trend for hours, sometimes days. There were some of the most famous controversies including…</p><h3 id=anniversary-rewards>Anniversary rewards<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#anniversary-rewards>#</a></h3><p>Though content creators and general malaise led to surprise, the Genshin community was concerned when they realized that the free rewards for the games anniversary was much lower than expected. The forums and subreddits were floodbed with complaints, leading to free speech bans in any case regarding anniversary rewards. The discontent was so bad that the players began to review other games to complain about the stinginess of Genshin’s anniversary rewards. Not even Google Classrooms were spared. A set of premium wings and additional octogenium currency was distributed to players in order to stop the anger, and they look dehydrated now.</p><h3 id=elon-musk-had-a-collaboration-that-never-happened>Elon Musk had a collaboration that never happened.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#elon-musk-had-a-collaboration-that-never-happened>#</a></h3><p>In a bizarre twist I can confidently say no one saw coming, the English Genshin Impact Twitter account attempted to become more followers for a fan content account by claiming to collaborate with Elon Musk. The community outcry was so negative that miHoYo deleted the tweet a few hours later. Many fans felt that the supposed Musk collaboration showed that miHoYo doesn’t really understand its community, as long as fans like him for justifiable reasons.</p><h3 id=the-leakers-hunt-decree>The leakers hunt decree.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-leakers-hunt-decree>#</a></h3><p>The crackdown on Genshin leakers continued in 2021, a long time after miHoYo continue to enforce legal crackdowns on data mining and beta test leakers. Despite all its efforts, unreleased game content continued to spread on social media up to a few weeks before it was officially released. I wondered whether miHoYo did take the time to look at the original characters.</p><h2 id=we-see-what-the-future-has-to-be-done>We see what the future has to be done.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#we-see-what-the-future-has-to-be-done>#</a></h2><p>Despite everything happening over the last year, Im optimistic about the willingness of developers to support older content while creating new worlds. There were tons of small, barely noticeable tweaks that didn’t make it into the official patch notes, and I expect more of them to follow in the future.
We had a house, and we’d gotten home. We’ve got a whole fishing system. There are minigames that wouldn’t be ideal for an open-world game at first glance. So glad I tried to give him a pull. I feel like that the Theater mechanic will likely be returning for the third year of Lantern Rite. But what I’m the most excited about most are the future additions that I didn’t know I wanted. Genshin is a game that can turn the head over one leaked or a behindscreen voiceline (looking at you, Kamisato Ayato). The idea of playing in Genshin is half of the experience and we’ve got plenty of crumbs to follow.
Anyone who played to the end of the Inazuma chapter knows that well be exploring the new Sumeru region soon, and im a little worried about the fact that a nation founded on Asia’s Southwest, South Asia and North Africa has just shown us light-skinned NPCs so far. I hope that this is something that they will end up addressing in future updates, especially since colorism is a problem which has already been discussed widely in the Genshin community. But I have seen what happens when a community gets heated over unreleased content. Sumeru may be really good. It could be terrible for me. But none of us will know until version 3.0 comes, likely sometime next year.
Although most AAA studios are struggling to develop games during the pandemic, miHoYo has already had the live-service schedule fixed. So far, all the questions that were presented in the launch preview have been answered in the main quest line. The community can anticipate teased content for months because miHoYos are consistent in delivering content that meets or exceeds its expectations.
While miHoYo repeated a few mistakes in the Inazumas execution, Genshin continued to hit the tenth meter with every major update. The games have been very successful first year of play. This means that the excitement of Genshin is unlikely to be getting bored early.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/generals-rulers-pc-game-free-download/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Generals Rulers Pc Game Free Download</span></a>
