While they were introduced in the original Diablo game expansion, Hellfire, runewords didn’t come back until Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction, which re-introduced Runes into the game. Ideally, you want to set the best runewords for each character - and so we’ve offered up our best build and runeword recommendations for all classes in Diablo 2. On this page: Different from Gemstones, Runes have the ability to be combined to create Runewords. These Runewrds give each Rune’s effect, but also a set of benefits particular to each combination. It’s worth noting that some Runes can only be transmuted with the addition of gems to the recipe, some others can only be transmuted in single-player mode, and some require only two instead of three. For example, if we use the runes ‘Tal’ and ‘Eth’, we will obtain the combination ‘TalEth’, which forms the Runeword “Stealth” - as shown in the image above - giving to an armor piece not only the two rune benefits but also a number of extra effects.\nAs rewards for completing the Hellforge quest in Act IV Slaying the boss monster The Countess - boss monster of The Forgotten Tower quest in Act I - which has a high drop rate\nRunes can be upgraded to more powerful ones by using the Horadric Cube to transmute three copies of the same rune, something you can also do with Gems. The list of Runes goes as follows:\nAmn Ber Cham Dol El Eld Eth Fal Gul Hel Io Ist Ith Jah Ko Lem Lo Lum Mal Nef Ohm Ort Pul Ral Shael Sol Sur Tal Thul Tir Um Vex Zod\nNot all the builds will make use of all stat points. Since not all the builds are set in stone, you just need to follow a base that will allow you to play with the remaining points at your own convenience. By level 99, between each point that you obtain by leveling up and the 12 extra points gained by completing the quests “Radament’s Lair”, “Fallen Angel”, and “Den of Evil” on each difficulty level, you will have 110 available Skill points to distribute. Here is each class and our build and runeword recommendations: Fury Werewolf Druid Build While some prefer Elemental approaches to their Druid builds, I’d rather go with the more consistent, always sturdy Werewolf. The idea is simple, you turn into a Werewolf and use Fury as your primary attack skill, with Feral Rage and Heart of the Wolverine/Oak Sage adding buffs to you and/or your group. All the core skills, such as Werewolf, Fury, Lycanthropy, and Feral Rage must be maxed out, with the remaining choice being which boosts you prefer, HP or Attack (Oak Sage/Heart of the Wolverine). The last points should aim to invest in unlocking the Grizzly summon skill, so you have a minion to divert aggro long enough to kill groups. Stats Distribution:\nStrength: Enough to wear the specific equipment you’re looking for, no more than that. Dexterity: Enough to wear the specific equipment you’re looking for, no more than that. Vitality: Every point you don’t invest in either Str or Dex goes here, this is by far the priority. Energy: Leave untouched, you don’t need it.\nSkill Points Distribution:\nWerewolf (20) Rabies (1, pre-requisite for Fury) Fury (20) Lycanthropy (20) Feral Rage (20) Heart of Wolverine (20) or Oak Sage (20) Raven (1, pre-requisite for Grizzly) Spirit Wolf (1, pre-requisite for Grizzly) Dire Wolf (1, pre-requisite for Grizzly) Grizzly (1 or more, at your convenience)\nBest Werewolf Druid Equipment and Runewords:\nWeapons: The Reaper’s Toll Secondary Weapons: Breath of the Dying Runeword (‘VexHelElEldZodEth’), Call to Arms (‘AmnRalMalIstOhm’), or Death (‘HelElVexOrtGul’) Helmet: Vampire Gaze, Cerebus’ Bite, Jalal’s Mane, Spirit Keeper Armor: Sigon’s Shelter in early levels, then you can go for the Runeword Duress (‘ShaelUmThul’), and then either Fortitude(‘ElSolDolLo’), or Chains of Honor (‘DolUmBerIst’) Belt: Sigon’s Wrap for early levels, and then Verdungo’s Hearty Cord or String of Ears Amulets: The Cat’s Eye, Highlord’s Wrath, Mara’s Kaleidoscope Rings: Cathans Seal x2 for early levels, then Raven Frost, and for the endgame Bul-Kathos’ Wedding Bands Gloves: Laying of Hands to begin, and then Dracul’s Grasp Boots: Sigon’s Sabot for early levels, and then Gore Rider\nTheir ability to move across the maps due to their Teleportation abilities and their Ranged skills also make them one of the best PVP classes in the game, since they can maintain mobility while also attacking from a safe distance. MeteOrb Sorceress Build This is a Sorceress build that focuses and relies on Fire and Cold Spells, especially useful to go in solo mode, not so much for PvP, mind you. While it may not be a really fast build, you will be able to wipe entire rooms of enemies with ease, making it way more reliable. Stats Distribution:\nStrength: 156 if you want to use a Monarch Shield, but adjust at your convenience. Dexterity: You can fully invest in Dex until you reach 75% Block Chance, but if you’re not interested in it, invest just enough to be able to wear equipment. Vitality: Every point you don’t invest in either Str or Dex goes here. Energy: Leave untouched, you don’t need it.\nSkill Points Distribution:\nFrozen Orb (20) Cold Mastery (Between 6 and 17, until you reach -100% Enemy Cold Resistance) Meteor (20) Fire Ball (20) Fire Mastery (20) Fire Bolt (1 or more, invest any remaining point here) Warmth (1) Static Field (1) Teleport (1) Inferno (1, Pre-Requisite) Blaze (1, Pre-Requisite) Firewall (1, Pre-Requisite) Telekinesis (1, Pre-Requisite) Ice Bolt (1, Pre-Requisite) Ice Blast (1, Pre-Requisite) Frost Nova (1, Pre-Requisite) Blizzard (1, Pre-Requisite)\nBest MeteOrb Sorceress Equipment and Runewords:\nWeapons: Heart of the Oak Runeword Staff (‘KoVexPulThul’), and if you feel inclined to block, a Spirit Runeword Shield (‘TalThulOrtAmn’) is recommended. Secondary Weapons: Death’s Fathom, and if you feel inclined to block, a Spirit Runeword Shield (‘TalThulOrtAmn’) is recommended. Helmet: Harlequin Crest, Nightwing’s Veil. Armor: Tal Rasha’s Guardianship, Chains of Honor Runeword (‘DolUmBerIst’), or Enigma Runeword (‘JahIthBer’). Belt: Verdungo’s Hearty Cord or Arachnid Mesh. Amulets: Tal Rasha’s Adjudication, Mara’s Kaleidoscope. Rings: Stone of Jordan x2. Gloves: Frostburn or Magefist, depending on which element you want to prioritize. Boots: Sandstorm Trek.\nSummonmancer Necromancer Build This build relies on you raising as many minions as you can and amplifying your damage output by cursing your enemies with Amplify Damage or Decrepify, and then using Corpse Explosion. This build runs especially well against tough bosses and unique monsters. Stats Distribution:\nStrength: 156 if you want to use a Monarch Shield, but adjust at your convenience. That being said, you won’t need it in the endgame, so it’s not really necessary. Dexterity: Invest just enough to be able to wear equipment. Vitality: Every point you don’t invest in either Str or Dex goes here, all in. Energy: Leave untouched, you don’t need it.\nSkill Points Distribution:\nRaise Skeleton (20) Skeleton Mastery (20) Corpse Explosion (20) Amplify Damage or Decrepify (20, they have a similar purpose, but you only need one maxed out, keep the other at 1) Clay Golem (1) Blood Golem (1) Iron Golem (1) Golem Mastery (1) Summon Resist (1) Revive (1) Terror (1) Dim Vision (1) Teeth (1)\nFor the rest of the points, invest them in your Golem of choice and/or Golem Mastery. Best Summonmancer Necromancer Equipment and Runeword:\nWeapons: Heart of the Oak Runeword Staff (‘KoVexPulThul’) Secondary Weapons: Beast Runeword Secondary Weapon (‘BerTirUmMalLum’), or Spirit Runeword Monarch Shield (‘TalThulOrtAmn’) Helmet: Harlequin Crest Armor: Trang-Oul’s Scales, Enigma Runeword Armor (‘JahIthBer’) Belt: Arachnid Mesh Amulets: Mara’s Kaleidoscope Rings: Stone of Jordan x2, Bul-Kathos’ Wedding Band x2 Gloves: Magefist, Trang-Oul’s Claws Boots: Marrowwalk\nMultiGuided Physical Bowazon Build Bowazon is the general term used to refer to the Bow and Crossbow-based builds, known for their versatility and mobility in battle. While they may need some time to get geared, they can be really fun to play. In this case, we will talk about a Multiple Shot-focused build with a Physical damage approach, which will enable you to focus on groups of enemies with extreme efficiency, but not so much against Bosses unless you use a Valkyrie. Stats Distribution:\nStrength: Enough to wear the specific equipment you’re looking for, no more than that. Dexterity: Enough to wear the specific equipment you’re looking for, no more than that. Vitality: Every point you don’t invest in either Str or Dex goes here, this is by far the priority. Energy: Leave untouched, you don’t need it.\nSkill Points Distribution:\nStrafe (20 or less, see Valkyrie) Guided Arrow (20) Critical Strike (20) Multiple Shot (20 or less, see Valkyrie) Penetrate (20) Pierce (1) Magic Arrow (1, Pre-Requisite) Cold Arrow (1, Pre-Requisite) Dodge (1, Pre-Requisite) Avoid (1, Pre-Requisite) Evade (1, Pre-Requisite) Inner Sight (1, Pre-Requisite) Slow Missiles (1, Pre-Requisite) Decoy (1, Pre-Requisite) Valkyrie (1 or more, you can sacrifice a few points in either Strafe or Multiple Shot if you want to invest in Valkyrie, which can help you in solo mode due to this Minion overall ability to divert aggro and stand their ground in battle)\nWeapon: Faith Runeword Bow (‘OhmJahLemEld’) or Windforce Bow Secondary Weapons: Call to Arms Runeword Axe (‘AmnRalMalIstOhm’) and Lidless Wall Shield or Spirit Runeword Shield (‘TalThulOrtAmn’) Helmet: Guillaume’s Face Armor: Fortitude Runeword Armor (‘ElSolDolLo’) Belts: Razortail Amulets: Highlord’s Wrath Rings: Raven Frost x2 Gloves: Laying of Hands Boots: War Traveler, Gore Rider\nZealot Paladin Build This build relies on using Zeal and Holy Shield with the Fanaticism or Defiance auras, to reach the highest possible melee potential and attack speed that the Paladin has to offer. Zeal will be your main tool for attack along with Fanaticism, with Holy Shield and Defiance being used for defensive purposes. Stats Distribution:\nStrength: 175 points here should be enough to wear the specific equipment you’re looking for, no more than that. Dexterity: 100 points here should be enough to wear the specific equipment you’re looking for, no more than that. Vitality: Every point you don’t invest in either Str or Dex goes here. Energy: Leave untouched, you don’t need it.\nSkill Points Distribution:\nZeal (20, always start investing here) Holy Shield (20) Fanaticism (20) Sacrifice (20) Defiance (20) Might (1, Pre-Requisite) Smite (1, Pre-Requisite) Holy Bolt (1, Pre-Requisite) Blessed Aim (1, Pre-Requisite) Charge (1, Pre-Requisite) Concentration (1, Pre-Requisite) Blessed Hammer (1, Pre-Requisite)\nBest Zealot Paladin Equipment and Runewords:\nWeapons: Grief Runeword Phase Blade (‘EthTirLoMalRal’) and Stormshield or Exile Runeword Vortex Shield (‘VexOhmIstDol’) Secondary Weapon: Call to Arms Runeword Weapon (‘AmnRalMalIstOhm’) and Spirit Runeword Shield (‘TalThulOrtAmn’) Helmet: Guillaume’s Face, Andariel’s Visage Armor: Guardian Angel, Enigma Runeword Armor (‘JahIthBer’), Fortitude Runeword Armor (‘ElSolDolLo’), or Chains of Honor Runeword (‘DolUmBerIst’) Belt: Verdungo’s Hearty Cord, String of Ears Amulets: Highlord’s Wrath Rings: Raven Frost x2 Gloves: Steelrend, Laying of Hands Boots: War Traveler, Gore Rider\nLightning Trap Assassin Build This build allows you to take care of entire rooms full of enemies effectively and safely, regardless of their positioning, since it relies on manipulating and slowing the enemies’ movement while also inflicting great amounts of damage. By summoning the spectral Shadow Master minion, you can divert aggro and retreat to the shadows with your Cloak of Shadows. Spawn Lightning Sentry or Wake of Inferno traps to kill enemies, and once you created enough corpses, use Death Sentry to make them explode. Stats Distribution:\nStrength: 100 points approximately, enough to wear the specific equipment you’re looking for, no more than that. Dexterity: You can fully invest in Dex until you reach 75% Block Chance, but if you’re not interested in it, invest just enough to be able to wear equipment. Vitality: Every point you don’t invest in either Str or Dex goes here, this is by far the priority. Energy: Leave untouched, you don’t need it.\nSkill Points Distribution:\nLightning Sentry (20) Wake of Inferno (20) Death Sentry (20) Shadow Master (20) Cloak of Shadows (10) Burst of Speed (10) Mind Blast (2) Fire Blast (1, Pre-Requisite) Shock Web (1, Pre-Requisite) Charged Bolt Sentry (1, Pre-Requisite) Wake of Fire (1, Pre-Requisite) Psychic Hammer (1, Pre-Requisite) Claw Mastery (1, Pre-Requisite) Weapon Block (1, Pre-Requisite) Shadow Warrior (1, Pre-Requisite)\nBest Lightning Trap Assassin Equipment and Runewords:\nWeapons: Bartuc’s Cut-Throat Claws Secondary Weapons: Heart of the Oak Runeword Weapon (‘KoVexPulThul’) and Stormshield Helmet: Harlequin Crest Armor: Skin of the Vipermagi, Enigma Runeword Armor (‘JahIthBer’) Belt: Arachnid Mesh, Verdungo’s Hearty Cord Amulets: Mara’s Kaleidoscope Rings: Stone of Jordan x2 Gloves: Frostburn, Magefist, or Trang-Oul’s Claws Boots: Marrowwalk, Shadow Dancer\nLooking for more help?

With Frenzy as your main attack skill, you can rely on Double Swing, Taunt, and Berserk to synergize with it, and Battle Orders offers the necessary buff for you and your group. Passive skills such as Increased Stamina, Increased Speed, Natural Resistance, and Iron skin, offer great benefits with the bare minimum investment in them.

While they were introduced in the original Diablo game expansion, Hellfire, runewords didn&rsquo;t come back until Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction, which re-introduced Runes into the game.
Ideally, you want to set the best runewords for each character - and so we&rsquo;ve offered up our best build and runeword recommendations for all classes in Diablo 2.

MeteOrb Sorceress Build
This is a Sorceress build that focuses and relies on Fire and Cold Spells, especially useful to go in solo mode, not so much for PvP, mind you. While it may not be a really fast build, you will be able to wipe entire rooms of enemies with ease, making it way more reliable.
Stats Distribution:</p><p>Strength: 156 if you want to use a Monarch Shield, but adjust at your convenience. Dexterity: You can fully invest in Dex until you reach 75% Block Chance, but if you&rsquo;re not interested in it, invest just enough to be able to wear equipment.

Boots: Sandstorm Trek.</p><p>Summonmancer Necromancer Build
This build relies on you raising as many minions as you can and amplifying your damage output by cursing your enemies with Amplify Damage or Decrepify, and then using Corpse Explosion. This build runs especially well against tough bosses and unique monsters.
Stats Distribution:</p><p>Strength: 156 if you want to use a Monarch Shield, but adjust at your convenience. That being said, you won&rsquo;t need it in the endgame, so it&rsquo;s not really necessary. Dexterity: Invest just enough to be able to wear equipment. Vitality: Every point you don&rsquo;t invest in either Str or Dex goes here, all in. Energy: Leave untouched, you don&rsquo;t need it.</p><p>Skill Points Distribution:</p><p>Raise Skeleton (20) Skeleton Mastery (20) Corpse Explosion (20) Amplify Damage or Decrepify (20, they have a similar purpose, but you only need one maxed out, keep the other at 1) Clay Golem (1) Blood Golem (1) Iron Golem (1) Golem Mastery (1) Summon Resist (1) Revive (1) Terror (1) Dim Vision (1) Teeth (1)</p><p>For the rest of the points, invest them in your Golem of choice and/or Golem Mastery.

Bowazon is the general term used to refer to the Bow and Crossbow-based builds, known for their versatility and mobility in battle. While they may need some time to get geared, they can be really fun to play.
In this case, we will talk about a Multiple Shot-focused build with a Physical damage approach, which will enable you to focus on groups of enemies with extreme efficiency, but not so much against Bosses unless you use a Valkyrie.

This build allows you to take care of entire rooms full of enemies effectively and safely, regardless of their positioning, since it relies on manipulating and slowing the enemies&rsquo; movement while also inflicting great amounts of damage.
By summoning the spectral Shadow Master minion, you can divert aggro and retreat to the shadows with your Cloak of Shadows. Spawn Lightning Sentry or Wake of Inferno traps to kill enemies, and once you created enough corpses, use Death Sentry to make them explode.
