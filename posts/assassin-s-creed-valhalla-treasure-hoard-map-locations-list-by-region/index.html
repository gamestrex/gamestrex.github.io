This page provides a list of Treasure Hoard map locations across the various regions of the game. Norway and England Treasure Horde locations: Ireland Treasure Horde locations (need to start Wrath of the Druids first): France Treasure Horde locations (need to start The Siege of Paris first): If you’re looking for more things to collect, then see our lists of Treasure Hoard maps and Book of Knowledge and ability locations. Where to find the Rygjafylke treasure hoard clue This clue can be found in Kjotve’s fortress. This area is far to the east of Rygjafykle. It may be inaccessible before you complete the early main mission A Cruel Destiny. It is on a table in a hut west of the main settlement, towards the shore. How to solve the Rygjafylke treasure hoard clue The clue is a note that reads: “Hunters of silver-glory! East of Alrekstad, the hoard will look upon you from Torghatten Rock’s eye. Engage its gaze and reap this reward.” Alrekstad is a village in Hordafylke, the province north of Rygjafylke. However, there seems to be an error in the clue - Torghatten Rock is actually quite far to the west of Alrekstad, on the next large island. The rock is a marked “mystery” location close to the synchronisation point. Once there you will find a large natural tunnel with many treasures inside. The treasure hoard itself is towards the eastern end. The treasure is the Snakebite Scheme (Sail) which is a design that can be applied to your longship at the shipyard in your settlement. Where to find the Grantebridgescire treasure hoard clue The clue for Grantebridgescire’s treasure hoard is in Besuncen Tor. This is in the northwestern part of Grantebridgescire. At the top of the waterlogged tower sticking out of the pond, there is a statue holding the scroll with the clue on it. How to solve the Grantebridgescire treasure hoard clue The clue is a note that reads: “Dearest Hilda, Pagan devils have struck the heart of Grantebridgescire. Luckily, your brother saw them on the Great Ouse before their hoard besieged the city walls of Grantebridge. I’m old so I cannot stray too far from our fishing hut near the town’s southern gate. I will hide our riches in the well behind the house, at the foot of the bent tree. Do not worry, I may be clumsy, but I can still operate a well! Your father, Echbert.” As promised, the hut is close to the gates of Grantebridge, close to the anchor fast travel point on the riverbank. The well is at the back of the house, covered over by breakable wood. Hit it with your axe to climb down. Inside you may find that the “clumsy” Echbert has taken an unfortunate tumble. But more importantly you will find some obsidian points and the treasure, which is the Snakebite Scheme (hull). This design can be applied to your longship at the shipyard in your settlement. Where to find the Ledecestrescire treasure hoard clue The clue for Ledecestrescire’s treasure hoard is in Venonis, west of Eivor’s home base of Ravensthorpe. Use Synin’s raven vision to locate the entrances to underground locations here. The one you want is the southerly one, near the riverbank where a fisherman is. Go inside, turn right and destroy some crates with your axe to reveal a crawl space. Inside is a chamber, with a decorative grave holding the scroll with the clue on it. How to solve the Ledecestrescire treasure hoard clue This clue is a sketch: There is also a note in the right hand corner of the room which reads: “I am calling a cease to my search. There is no treasure here. I must have searched every inch of this grotto top to bottom. Someone removed it ages ago, I’m certain of it. Maybe I will return and have a look with a sober eye next time, but I doubt it will make much difference.” Lucky for us, this treasure hunter is wrong. The treasure is on the island in Ledecestrecire to the northwest of Ravensthorpe. It is about halfway between Venonis and Tamworth Fortress, towards the western shore. If you look closely on the map, you can see an outcropping of rock similar to the one shown in the sketch. If you approach the outcropping from the east you will see its peak with a wooden and red ribbon marker. The spot is at ground level, to the left of the marker. There are two large boulders and two trees, if you pass between them you will see the silver glow marking the lootable spot. It is in some scree behind a red leafed beech tree. It is not visible with Odin’s sight or the raven, so look closely on the ground. The treasure is the Snakebite Scheme (Shield) which is a design that can be applied to your longship at the shipyard in your settlement. Where to find the East Anglia treasure hoard clue This clue can be found to the south of East Anglia, near the synchronisation point at Edmund’s Hope just east of Beodoricsworth. The synchronisation point is a tall church tower. The inside of the church is burned and there are bodies; you may also find a particularly unfriendly nun, however, she’s not necessary for finding the treasure hoard clue. Instead, at the bottom of the tower, look up to find a ladder that you need to shoot down with an arrow. After climbing the ladder, you will find a note which reads: “I made a Saxon beg for the sweet gift of death for this knowledge. There is a great treasure hidden near the church. The way is shut, but I have the key. Tell the jarl I will return with the greatest spoils.” The key is next to it. Take it to the smaller chapel to the east of the synchronisation point tower. The clue is on the table inside. How to solve the East Anglia treasure hoard clue This clue is a sketch: In the northeast of East Anglia, look for the small island just off from the shore and an actually circular lake (not semicircular like in the clue image). In the centre of the lake is an island with aggressive boars. After dealing with them, the treasure will be right in the centre of the three goddess statues. The treasure is the Snakebite Scheme (Tailpeice) which is a design that can be applied to your longship at the shipyard in your settlement. Where to find the Oxenefordscire treasure hoard clue To reach this riddle, you will need to start from the village of Eaton Barn, a little ways south of the clue’s actual map marker. In the cliff on the northern border, there’s an explodable wall. Enter the cliff face through this and progress into a large central chamber. To the back left corner, you’ll find some movable shelves; slide them aside to enter the room where the scroll is waiting on a platform. How to solve the Oxenefordscire treasure hoard clue The clue reads: “In the southern heaths of Oxenefordscire, there is a vast pasture. The livestock act as my protector. They hum and haw away the evil demons. Find the peculiar tree casting its shadow on a small ruin. You can find me where the waters used to run. The lost shimmer of its wavelets still shines within me.” The pastures are to the southwest of Oxenefordscire. It may be easier to find the tree and the ruin from the air using Synin’s raven sight. The tree is easily the largest and widest in the area, while the ruin is a rectangular building at the corner of two drystone walls with a small yellow-brown tarpaulin over it. Between the tree and the ruin is a well, this is the place where the waters used to run. Break through the wood on top to drop down and find the treasure. The treasure is the Snakebite Scheme (Figurehead) which is a design that can be applied to your longship at the shipyard in your settlement. Where to find the Sciropescire treasure hoard clue This clue is underneath the synchronisation point in the centre of Sciropescire called Hill Gate Remnants. At the west of the tower is a door; enter and look up to see a hanging net of wood. Shooting this down will open a hole in the floor. Drop down and slide through the small gap in the bottom of the wall on the right. This room is very dark, but the clue is simply on the table against the far wall. How to solve the Sciropescire treasure hoard clue This clue is a sketch titled Sciropsescire Caustow Castle Hoard Map: On the map, you can see two lakes close to the Caustow Castle. The treasure is within the larger one to the north. Once you reach the location, simply take a few steps off the edge of the pier to find it. The treasure is the Vidarr Scheme (Head). This is a tattoo that Eivor can get from the artist in the Raventhorpe settlement. Where to find the Cent treasure hoard clue This treasure hoard clue is at Dover Pharos, on the southern coast of the map, to the west of Dover Cliffs and Dover Fortress. Simply climb to the top of the tower to find the clue, avoiding the snakes if you use the interior path. There are also a pair of brothers here; if you help the stuck one they will talk about treasure hidden at the large snake. How to solve the Cent treasure hoard clue This clue is a sketch, showing the large snake that can also be seen on the in-game map to the west of Cent: Travel to the snake - it’s a bit hard to see from the ground, but it is made up of white, non-grassy areas. The treasure is nestled in a rock that is its “eye,” towards the northern side. Watch out for the real snakes! This treasure is the Speki Symbol Scheme (Back). This is a tattoo that Eivor can get from the artist in the Raventhorpe settlement. Where to find the Suthsexe Crawlie treasure hoard clue This clue is in the town of Crawleah, towards the south of Suthsexe. The clue can be found in a warehouse in the south of town. The area is distrustful and heavily guarded, and the back door is barred, so you will have to sneak or fight through the front, but once inside the clue is easily found on a table to the right of the doorway. How to solve the Suthsexe Crawlie treasure hoard clue This clue is a sketch: The location is due south of Crawleah. On the map it is depicted as a large lake. The treasure can be found on a small island in the upper part of the waterfall area, towards the southern side. This treasure is the Huginn Call Scheme (Back). This is a tattoo that Eivor can get from the artist in the Raventhorpe settlement. Where to find the Essexe treasure hoard clue This book can be found in the church in the northwest of Colcester, the main city found close to the centre of Essexe. You will come to Colcester often during the Essexe arc of the main questline. Approaching the church from the east, you will see a slidable set of shelves blocking a stained glass window; move them and shoot through the window to find the key. Next, enter the main part of the church and unlock the door. In this tower, first slide the shelves backwards and climb them to access the first ladder. Now, shoot down the second ladder and climb it too to reach the top of the tower. The clue is on the edge close to a window. How to solve the Essexe treasure hoard clue This treasure hoard clue reads: “To the south of Essexe, your eyes must train themselves away from the tower built by Roman giants, through the green fur of nature, a sacred marking made by three skins of trees in a circle of plants.” This location is on the banks of the Thames river, halfway between Epinga Forest and Wulfaswic. Look for the circle of purple flowers to the east of the ruined tower mentioned in the clue. The treasure is inside. This treasure is the Huginn Call Scheme (Arms). This is a tattoo that Eivor can get from the artist in the Raventhorpe settlement. Where to find the Lincolnscire treasure hoard clue This clue is in Whisby, a small ruined town on the eastern shore of a lake near the centre of Lincolnscire. The area is not marked as restricted, but there are a few hostile guards anyway, so be cautious. You will need to take a key from a boat in the lake and then open the door to the main hut in the village. The clue will simply be on a table on the left. On the right is a loot chest too. How to solve the Lincolnscire treasure hoard clue This clue reads: “To the east of Lincolnscire, in Skegi’s Beard, there lies a stretch of coast detached by the angry sea. From my guard tower wherein lies my dearest of properties, I watch over this land, guarding against the invasion of the barbarians who never cease. This hoard possesses the last relics of the Kingdom of Lindsey, and I forever shall defend it. Aellen of Mercia.” Skegi’s Beard is towards the centre of the eastern coast of Lincolnshire - it looks like a large lake on the map. The treasure hoard is at the top of the tower near the northeastern shore of the lake. This treasure is the Speki Symbol Scheme (Front). This is a tattoo that Eivor can equip in the Ravensthorpe settlement. How to find the Jorvik treasure hoard clue This clue is in the Minster, close to the northerly synchronisation point in the city of Jorvik. To enter, find the open window on the southern side, close to where the tower is. From there, head to the passage on the opposite side of the altar to find a slideable set of shelves. Move them aside to find the clue. How to solve the Jorvik treasure hoard clue This treasure hoard clue reads: “From the top of Forseti’s Rest, you will see a lady standing at the southern boundary of Jorvik, looking at the river day and night. The treasure is protected by her trained eye. She is a blessed one, eternally loyal to the relics of lost saints.” Forseti’s Rest is a tower between the fork of the river in the south of Jorvik. From there, the statue can be seen clearly to the south. Otherwise, just head to the western bank of the river before it forks and you will see the statue. Climb up to the bowl to retrieve the treasure. This treasure is the Huginn Call Scheme (Head). This is a tattoo that Eivor can equip in the Ravensthorpe settlement. How to find the Eurvicscire treasure hoard clue This clue is at the Petuaria ruins, which is close to where the Durwent river meets the Humbre river, a little way southeast of Jorvik. To find this clue, simply climb to the top of the large square tower on the southern side of the ruins. How to solve the Eurvicscire treasure hoard clue This clue is a sketch: You can see this location just to the east of Petuaria ruins on the map. In the centre of the building is a pool, which appears to be the point shown in the clue. (There is also a Lost Draugr mystery here). You may, however, experience a bug where the treasure does not appear in the game. Where to find the Suthsexe Monk’s Lair treasure hoard clue This clue can be found in the northeast corner of Suthsexe, a little way north of the synchronization point. It’s in a hut in the woods marked as the Monk’s Lair. The clue is simply on a table to the right of the house. To the left is a chest. How to solve the Suthsexe Monk’s Lair treasure hoard clue The clue reads: “In the northern and western corner of Suthsexe, under the oldest tree in Chertsey Abbey lies my glory-wealth. A memorial stone is split, as lightning struck this hoard once it was buried there to illuminate it with God’s light.” As stated, the abbey is a ruined building in the northwest corner of Suthsexe, not far north from where the clue was. The graveyard is to the west of the abbey - look for the large tree and the broken headstone. This treasure is the Cross Face Scheme (Head). This is a tattoo that Eivor can equip in the Ravensthorpe settlement. Where to find the Suthsexe Witch’s House treasure hoard clue The witch’s house is just west of Guildford, in western Suthesexe. At the back of the house is a crawlspace that you can shoot through to open. Be careful though, because there’s poison inside the house, so Eivor will take damage over time while inside. The clue is on a table near the far wall. How to solve the Suthsexe Witch’s house treasure hoard clue This clue is a sketch: This chalk figure is in eastern Suthsexe. It’s a little difficult to spot on the map unless zoomed in: it’s close to a lake and there’s also a Fly Agaric mystery here. Though the X in the sketch is in the general chest area, you will actually find the treasure in the figure’s armpit. Watch out for wolves in the area! The treasure is the Huginn Call Scheme (Front). This is a tattoo that Eivor can equip in the Ravensthorpe settlement. Where to find the Glowecestrescire treasure hoard clue This map is simply in a location called Sabrina’s Spring, just to the northeast of the central synchronisation point in Glowecestrescire. It’s being held by a statue in a small flowered glade. How to solve the Glowecestrescire treasure hoard clue This clue is a sketch: This location is called Maen Ceti, and it’s in the northwest of Glowecestrescire. There’s also a cairne mystery here. Behind the tree, in the lowered ring, there’s a slidable shelf. You’ll want to pick up and throw the rock out of the way first though, then you can pull them forwards to reveal an alcove with a chest and the treasure. This treasure is the Seer Scheme (Hull). This is a decoration that Eivor can apply to their longship in the Ravensthorpe settlement. Where to find the Wincestre Seminary treasure hoard clue This clue can be found in the Wincestre Seminary, towards the south of the city. At the church building itself, towards the south of the area, find the stained glass window that faces east, shoot through it, and drop down inside to retrieve the clue. How to solve the Wincestre Seminary treasure hoard clue This clue is a sketch: This location is not in Wincestre, but in northern Hamtunscire; it’s the horse depicted just to the west of the northern syncronisation point, though rotated. If you look closely at the map, you can follow the horse’s tail to a small circle. This is where the treasure is. In game it’s a small stone circle with dry ground inside. This treasure is the Seer Scheme (Figurehead). This is a decoration that Eivor can apply to their longship in the Ravensthorpe settlement. Where to find the Wincestre Bishopric treasure hoard clue This clue can be found in the Wincestre Bishopric, towards the east of the city. This is a heavily restricted area with guards ready to attack. It can, however, be obtained simply by going to the right after entering and climbing onto the second story. The clue is behind a breakable wooden wall. How to solve the Wincestre Bishopric treasure hoard clue This clue is a sketch: It depicts the Isle of Wiht just to the south of Hamtunscire. The spot, surrounded by two semicircles of white stone, may be easier to see from the air. This treasure is the.Seer Scheme (Shields). This is a decoration that Eivor can apply to their longship in the Ravensthorpe settlement. Where to find the Lunden treasure hoard clue Though this clue is titled Lunden treasure hoard, it’s actually in the village of Hammeham, in southeast Oxenfordescire. On the northern side of town is a well; simply break the wood and drop down to find the clue. How to solve the Lunden treasure hoard clue This clue is a map sketch: This location is further north into Oxenfordscire, not too far south of Saint Albanes Abbey. From the end of the double-arched ruined wall, head north to the closest ruin. The treasure is on the ground inside. This treasure is the Speki Symbol Scheme (Head). This is a tattoo that Eivor can equip in the Ravensthorpe settlement. Where to find the Snotinghamscire treasure hoard clue This clue can be found at the Abandoned Library towards the north of the county, just northeast of Hemthorpe. Smash the large breakable wooden area and go down the steps. Before the barred door, smash the jars to reveal a small gap that Eivor can slide through to locate the clue. How to solve the Snotinghamscire treasure hoard clue This clue reads: “My iridescence has moved from the diocese. To the south of Snotinghamscire you can find me. Simply venture into the eye of the forest, Minninglow. Look past the forgotten stone portals and past the top of the hill. You will find me ambushed by a family of trees. There my luster lingers. The voice of saint Eanfleda.” Minninglow is marked on the map in the far south of Snotinghamscire, close to Repton just across the border. Very slightly west of the map marker there is a well in a patch of snow. The treasure can be found next to it. This treasure is the Seer Scheme (Tailpiece). This is a decoration that Eivor can apply to their longship in the Ravensthorpe settlement. Where to find the Hamtunscire treasure hoard clue This clue can be found in Fearnhamme, a village on the eastern border of the county of Hamtunscire. The clue is in the main large building filled with fabrics, below a brick square in the ground. You can break this with the Incendiary Powder arrows, or climb to the roof to shoot down a hanging weight. How to solve the Hamtunscire treasure hoard clue This clue is a puzzle that reads: “In the south and western corner of Hamtunscire, lost in Wishtman’s Wood, I ran from the devil with my riches. Fatigued like a hunting hound, the darkness of the trees sending shivers in my spine, an endless fog clouding my vision, a tree of holy red, placed by the Holy Spirit and marked with the Blood of Christ: here. I paid my divine commissions, I gave my wealth to the ancient reliquary, and the Lord pardoned my fees.” Wishtman’s Wood is not too far west in Hamtunscire, just north of the town and synchronisation point of Wertham. Zoomed in on the map, a small pair of lakes are visible, east of Dertemor Bandit Camp. This is where the large white and red tree is, and the treasure is at the foot. The treasure is the Warrior Tears Scheme. This is a tattoo that Eivor can equip in the Ravensthorpe settlement. Where to find the Dublin treasure hoard clue The Treasure Hoard clue can be found as follows: Head directly south from the Dublin city and go towards the coast. You’ll eventually come across a small, broken dock and a locked door. Use your Odin’s sight and the key will be behind you in the water. Grab the key, unlock the door, head inside and grab the clue that’s on the table. How to solve the Dublin treasure hoard clue The clue is a small map that shows what looks to be an oddly-shaped field that’s set next to a hut of some kind. You’ll be able to find that hut just east of the trader post in Rathdown. It’s a hut with several big fields and unfortunately it’s very easy to get lost in there. Thankfully, we’ve ticked off exactly where you can find the treasure for yourself. The treasure is the Na Pucai Scheme Tailpiece, something which Eivor can equip for their ship back in Ravensthorpe. Where to find the Southern Ui Neil treasure hoard clue Head to the E of Meath on the map and you’ll come across a camp where some Druids are resting. Clear the camp and head to one of the tents, and you’ll come across the clue for the Southern Ui Neil treasure hoard. How to solve the Southern Ui Neil treasure hoard clue The Southern Ui Neil clue is a spiral, almost octopus-like shape with an X marked at the left corner. It isn’t too far from where you found the clue either, just head north to where, using your Raven, you’ll see the same spiral pattern with a rock sitting in the middle of it. The treasure is the Na Pucai Scheme Hull, something which Eivor can equip for their ship back in Ravensthorpe. Where to find the Brega treasure hoard clue Just south of Armagh is a deserted battleground. You’ll know you’re in the right place as soon as you see a dip in the middle, strewn with bodies from a battle. It’s there you’ll spot the Brega treasure hoard map. How to solve the Brega treasure hoard clue The Brega treasure clue shows a selection of forest, with circular shapes cluttered at the far left, as well as at the bottom. The X will be marked at the top, near the first circle, also at the top. Head to the location on the map, and circle around the spiral, outcrop until you come across the treasure. You’ll know you’ve found it when you see something sparkly. The treasure is the Na Pucai Scheme Shields, something which Eivor can equip for their ship back in Ravensthorpe. Where to find the Potion of Strength treasure hoard clue Off on a lone island just east of the Trade Post Athlone you’ll come across a small campsite, with a breakable door embedded deep into a cave-like structure. Break open the door and you’ll come across the Potion of Strength treasure hoard clue. How to solve the Potion of Strength treasure hoard clue This clue is a letter that reads: “My distant cousin, a venerable elderly druid as am I, lives across seas in Francia. He taught me the makings of a miraculous potion! It gives whoever drinks it powerful strength. I do not have precisely the same herbs, but I plan to make and consume the potion in the northern part of the island where stand massive stones. With the potion, I hope to lift one. May the spirits be with me.” Do exactly what the letter says and head north until you come across a large selection of stones. Near one of the stones is the treasure. The treasure is the Norse-Gael Scheme tattoo for Eivor’s arms. The clue for the Connacht treasure hoard is located on the lone island, West of Connacht. Climb the island (but not to the very top) and you’ll see a footpath of stone that you can walk around. Do so, and you’ll eventually come across an area that’s blocked off and can only be broken open with via an Explosive Arrow or a fire barrel. Inside you’ll find the Connacht treasure hoard clue. How to solve the Connacht treasure hoard clue This clue is an actual map. It shows a wooded area, as well as circle that’s drawn to be a well. This one is tougher to find, but if you can match the outline of the area, you’ll realize it’s actually the small island just east of Lough Gara. Follow the trailing road and you’ll come across the well. Shoot it open with an arrow, hop inside and you’ll find the treasure. The treasure is the Na Pucai Scheme Sail that Eivor can equip for their ship in Ravensthorpe. Where to find the My Friend, The Priest treasure hoard clue Head to the Lough Rea loch just south of Connacht, there you’ll come across a woodland area where a dead priest, horse and a destroyed carriage are waiting nearby. Check the dead priest’s corpse and he’ll have a letter on his person. How to solve the My Friend, The Priest treasure hoard clue This clue is a letter from the friend of a dead preist. It reads: “Though you do not believe in the earth spirits and pray to your one god, the wind spirits tell me the signs are clear. Do not journey to your wife’s crypt. Unlike me and the other peaceful druids, the druids of Kiltober have turned to darkness. They are determined to destroy your kind. Your wife now exists wherever you find yourself, no need to make dangerous pilgrimages! Your pagan friend, Mara.” Unfortunately the poor priest did make his visit, and as such his remains have been ransacked by the druids in Kiltober. Go and give them a visit, clearing out their camp. With Odin’s sight you’ll be led towards a door, open it and you’ll find a skeleton and some opal. Search the skeleton and you’ll find the treasure. The treasure is the Norse-Gael Scheme tattoo for Eivor’s face. Where to find the Dream of Druids treasure hoard clue From Lough Rea loch, head north west and you’ll come across a rather spooky looking outcrop of rock. You’ll know you’re in the right place as the area goes rather grey and foggy. A part of the outcrop turns inwards, and you’ll come across a lit up area. There you’ll find the treasure hoard clue. How to solve the Dream of Druids treasure hoard clue This clue is a poem. It reads: “The stones stand\rIn silent circle\rWater washed\rSpirit inspired\rThe northernmost lough In all Connacht\rCenter yourself there” This one is fairly simple, as the northernmost lough in the entirety of Connacht is Lough Gara. It isn’t too far away from where the poem is found either, so all you need to do is head to the Lough and stand in the very middle of the circular pond. There you’ll find the treasure. The treasure is the Norse-Gael Scheme tattoo for Eivor’s torso. Where to find the Ulster treasure hoard clue The clue for the Ulster treasure hoard club is just above the Erne River, located inside a small hut that sits by the riverbed. The door is barred, but go around to the other side and shoot the lock off with an arrow. Head inside and you’ll see the Ulster treasure hoard clue on a table. How to solve the Ulster treasure hoard clue This clue is an actual map. It shows a dock, and a small hut that sits atop of it. The X mark seems to indicate the treasure hoard is on the dock around the house however, and not inside it. You can find the dock just south of the Errigal Summit waypoint, and just sitting above Lough Eske. Sure enough, when you search around the hut you’ll discover the treasure. The treasure is the Na Pucai Scheme Figurehead that Eivor can equip for their ship in Ravensthorpe. Where to find the Last Days of the Village treasure hoard clue This clue can be found just West of the Donegal Abbey in an abandoned village. The hoard will be in a locked house, but you’ll be able to blow off the lock with a well-shot arrow placement and head on inside. It’ll be located on a table at the top of the house. How to solve the Last Days of the Village treasure hoard clue This clue is a letter. It reads: “The plague-stricken village turned to me, a druid, after a bishop had tried to chase away ’evil spirits.’ Gathered beneath the moon, we prayed to the goddess, not for survival, but for a joyful journey to the place of the dead. Each villager thanked me in their final moments. My last duty was to collect their treasure and offer them to the sun spirit. They are hidden on the coast, out of view of the setting sun.” This treasure is much simpler to find, as all you’ll need to do is keep heading west until you reach a cliff. Jump down into the water and head inwards and you’ll discover a boat and a cave. Head inside that cave and you’ll be able to collect the treasure. The treasure is the Norse-Gael Scheme tattoo for Eivor’s back. The new DLC is here - and we explain how to start The Siege of Paris, as well as new romance options and Treasure Hoard locations.\rIf you’re after end game activities in the full game, we can explain how to get Nodens’ Arc, Excalibur, Thor gear and other Valhalla armour sets, Power Level and how to get XP fast, Order of the Ancients locations and all Assassin’s Creed Valhalla story choices.\rIf you’re looking for things to collect and upgrade, we have lists on best skills and Book of Knowledge locations.\rWhere to find the Melun treasure hoard clue The Melun treasure hoard clue is far to the east of Melunois. There you will find some ruins with water pouring into them and a man surrounded by his dead comrades. You can safely ignore him for now, however, and instead break the crates to his left in order to find a key. The key opens the door to his right. Inside, along with a lootable chest, you will find an explosive oil jar. Carefully carry this back outside and behind the waterfall to find the wall that needs blowing up. Behind it, you will find the clue. This clue is a map. You can check the map at any time from the bottom section of the Inventory Bag in the inventory menu. How to solve the Melun treasure hoard clue The spot the map is pointing to is north of the clue’s location. It’s actually a short way into the Amienois area. Head for higher ground to the east of the river and you should see the ruins shown in the map. Watch out for some powerful wolves in the area. The treasure is to the east of the ruins, a short way behind the two large statues. This treasure is the Ouroburos Scheme (Back). This is a tattoo design that Eivor can apply when they are back in the settlement. Where to find the Paris treasure hoard clue The Paris treasure hoard clue can be found at the Saint-Denis church, to the north of the area. There is a door on the western side of the church. It is barred but from the outside, so give it a good whack to open it. Turn left, avoiding and chasing away the rats, to hop over the boxes. Climb up the bookshelf on the left, jump across to the balcony on the other wall, and climb up through the small hole to the next level. There are more rats here so keep climbing, up the bell and another balcony to the wooden struts. Finally you will reach the top of the tower where the clue is waiting for you. Break the crates and move the shelves aside for an easy exit. This clue is a map. You can check the map at any time from the bottom section of the Inventory Bag in the inventory menu. How to solve the Paris treasure hoard clue The church on this map is the Saint-Denis, where the clue is located. So head south into the city of Paris to find the treasure itself. Don’t forget that the guards are suspicious there, so remain cloaked and keep your distance. The treasure is at the bottom of a well. The well is on one of the side streets about halfway down the main road through the city, on the eastern side. It is south of Le Vieil Arbre, where there is a prominently marked spot for offering to the gods, and north of the Clever Fox Tavern. This treasure is the Oriflamme Scheme (Back). This is a tattoo that Eivor can equip in the settlement.

Where to find the Rygjafylke treasure hoard clue
This clue can be found in Kjotve&rsquo;s fortress. This area is far to the east of Rygjafykle. It may be inaccessible before you complete the early main mission A Cruel Destiny. It is on a table in a hut west of the main settlement, towards the shore.
How to solve the Rygjafylke treasure hoard clue
The clue is a note that reads:
&ldquo;Hunters of silver-glory! East of Alrekstad, the hoard will look upon you from Torghatten Rock&rsquo;s eye. Engage its gaze and reap this reward.&rdquo;
Alrekstad is a village in Hordafylke, the province north of Rygjafylke. However, there seems to be an error in the clue - Torghatten Rock is actually quite far to the west of Alrekstad, on the next large island. The rock is a marked &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; location close to the synchronisation point.
Once there you will find a large natural tunnel with many treasures inside. The treasure hoard itself is towards the eastern end.
The treasure is the Snakebite Scheme (Sail) which is a design that can be applied to your longship at the shipyard in your settlement.
Where to find the Grantebridgescire treasure hoard clue
The clue for Grantebridgescire&rsquo;s treasure hoard is in Besuncen Tor. This is in the northwestern part of Grantebridgescire. At the top of the waterlogged tower sticking out of the pond, there is a statue holding the scroll with the clue on it.
How to solve the Grantebridgescire treasure hoard clue
The clue is a note that reads:
&ldquo;Dearest Hilda, Pagan devils have struck the heart of Grantebridgescire. Luckily, your brother saw them on the Great Ouse before their hoard besieged the city walls of Grantebridge. I&rsquo;m old so I cannot stray too far from our fishing hut near the town&rsquo;s southern gate. I will hide our riches in the well behind the house, at the foot of the bent tree. Do not worry, I may be clumsy, but I can still operate a well! Your father, Echbert.&rdquo;
As promised, the hut is close to the gates of Grantebridge, close to the anchor fast travel point on the riverbank. The well is at the back of the house, covered over by breakable wood. Hit it with your axe to climb down.
Inside you may find that the &ldquo;clumsy&rdquo; Echbert has taken an unfortunate tumble. But more importantly you will find some obsidian points and the treasure, which is the Snakebite Scheme (hull). This design can be applied to your longship at the shipyard in your settlement.
Where to find the Ledecestrescire treasure hoard clue
The clue for Ledecestrescire&rsquo;s treasure hoard is in Venonis, west of Eivor&rsquo;s home base of Ravensthorpe. Use Synin&rsquo;s raven vision to locate the entrances to underground locations here. The one you want is the southerly one, near the riverbank where a fisherman is.
Go inside, turn right and destroy some crates with your axe to reveal a crawl space. Inside is a chamber, with a decorative grave holding the scroll with the clue on it.
How to solve the Ledecestrescire treasure hoard clue
This clue is a sketch:
There is also a note in the right hand corner of the room which reads:
&ldquo;I am calling a cease to my search. There is no treasure here. I must have searched every inch of this grotto top to bottom. Someone removed it ages ago, I&rsquo;m certain of it. Maybe I will return and have a look with a sober eye next time, but I doubt it will make much difference.&rdquo;
Lucky for us, this treasure hunter is wrong. The treasure is on the island in Ledecestrecire to the northwest of Ravensthorpe. It is about halfway between Venonis and Tamworth Fortress, towards the western shore. If you look closely on the map, you can see an outcropping of rock similar to the one shown in the sketch.
If you approach the outcropping from the east you will see its peak with a wooden and red ribbon marker.
The spot is at ground level, to the left of the marker. There are two large boulders and two trees, if you pass between them you will see the silver glow marking the lootable spot. It is in some scree behind a red leafed beech tree. It is not visible with Odin&rsquo;s sight or the raven, so look closely on the ground.
The treasure is the Snakebite Scheme (Shield) which is a design that can be applied to your longship at the shipyard in your settlement.
Where to find the East Anglia treasure hoard clue
This clue can be found to the south of East Anglia, near the synchronisation point at Edmund&rsquo;s Hope just east of Beodoricsworth.
The synchronisation point is a tall church tower. The inside of the church is burned and there are bodies; you may also find a particularly unfriendly nun, however, she&rsquo;s not necessary for finding the treasure hoard clue. Instead, at the bottom of the tower, look up to find a ladder that you need to shoot down with an arrow.
After climbing the ladder, you will find a note which reads:
&ldquo;I made a Saxon beg for the sweet gift of death for this knowledge. There is a great treasure hidden near the church. The way is shut, but I have the key. Tell the jarl I will return with the greatest spoils.&rdquo;
The key is next to it. Take it to the smaller chapel to the east of the synchronisation point tower. The clue is on the table inside.
How to solve the East Anglia treasure hoard clue
This clue is a sketch:
In the northeast of East Anglia, look for the small island just off from the shore and an actually circular lake (not semicircular like in the clue image).
In the centre of the lake is an island with aggressive boars. After dealing with them, the treasure will be right in the centre of the three goddess statues.
The treasure is the Snakebite Scheme (Tailpeice) which is a design that can be applied to your longship at the shipyard in your settlement.
Where to find the Oxenefordscire treasure hoard clue
To reach this riddle, you will need to start from the village of Eaton Barn, a little ways south of the clue&rsquo;s actual map marker.
In the cliff on the northern border, there&rsquo;s an explodable wall. Enter the cliff face through this and progress into a large central chamber. To the back left corner, you&rsquo;ll find some movable shelves; slide them aside to enter the room where the scroll is waiting on a platform.
How to solve the Oxenefordscire treasure hoard clue
The clue reads:
&ldquo;In the southern heaths of Oxenefordscire, there is a vast pasture. The livestock act as my protector. They hum and haw away the evil demons. Find the peculiar tree casting its shadow on a small ruin. You can find me where the waters used to run. The lost shimmer of its wavelets still shines within me.&rdquo;
The pastures are to the southwest of Oxenefordscire. It may be easier to find the tree and the ruin from the air using Synin&rsquo;s raven sight. The tree is easily the largest and widest in the area, while the ruin is a rectangular building at the corner of two drystone walls with a small yellow-brown tarpaulin over it.
Between the tree and the ruin is a well, this is the place where the waters used to run. Break through the wood on top to drop down and find the treasure.
The treasure is the Snakebite Scheme (Figurehead) which is a design that can be applied to your longship at the shipyard in your settlement.
Where to find the Sciropescire treasure hoard clue
This clue is underneath the synchronisation point in the centre of Sciropescire called Hill Gate Remnants.
At the west of the tower is a door; enter and look up to see a hanging net of wood. Shooting this down will open a hole in the floor. Drop down and slide through the small gap in the bottom of the wall on the right. This room is very dark, but the clue is simply on the table against the far wall.
How to solve the Sciropescire treasure hoard clue
This clue is a sketch titled Sciropsescire Caustow Castle Hoard Map:
On the map, you can see two lakes close to the Caustow Castle. The treasure is within the larger one to the north. Once you reach the location, simply take a few steps off the edge of the pier to find it.
The treasure is the Vidarr Scheme (Head). This is a tattoo that Eivor can get from the artist in the Raventhorpe settlement.
Where to find the Cent treasure hoard clue
This treasure hoard clue is at Dover Pharos, on the southern coast of the map, to the west of Dover Cliffs and Dover Fortress.
Simply climb to the top of the tower to find the clue, avoiding the snakes if you use the interior path. There are also a pair of brothers here; if you help the stuck one they will talk about treasure hidden at the large snake.
How to solve the Cent treasure hoard clue
This clue is a sketch, showing the large snake that can also be seen on the in-game map to the west of Cent:
Travel to the snake - it&rsquo;s a bit hard to see from the ground, but it is made up of white, non-grassy areas. The treasure is nestled in a rock that is its &ldquo;eye,&rdquo; towards the northern side. Watch out for the real snakes!
This treasure is the Speki Symbol Scheme (Back). This is a tattoo that Eivor can get from the artist in the Raventhorpe settlement.
Where to find the Suthsexe Crawlie treasure hoard clue
This clue is in the town of Crawleah, towards the south of Suthsexe.
The clue can be found in a warehouse in the south of town. The area is distrustful and heavily guarded, and the back door is barred, so you will have to sneak or fight through the front, but once inside the clue is easily found on a table to the right of the doorway.
How to solve the Suthsexe Crawlie treasure hoard clue

The location is due south of Crawleah. On the map it is depicted as a large lake.

Approaching the church from the east, you will see a slidable set of shelves blocking a stained glass window; move them and shoot through the window to find the key.
Next, enter the main part of the church and unlock the door.
In this tower, first slide the shelves backwards and climb them to access the first ladder. Now, shoot down the second ladder and climb it too to reach the top of the tower. The clue is on the edge close to a window.
How to solve the Essexe treasure hoard clue
This treasure hoard clue reads:
&ldquo;To the south of Essexe, your eyes must train themselves away from the tower built by Roman giants, through the green fur of nature, a sacred marking made by three skins of trees in a circle of plants.&rdquo;

Where to find the Lincolnscire treasure hoard clue
This clue is in Whisby, a small ruined town on the eastern shore of a lake near the centre of Lincolnscire.
The area is not marked as restricted, but there are a few hostile guards anyway, so be cautious.
You will need to take a key from a boat in the lake and then open the door to the main hut in the village. The clue will simply be on a table on the left. On the right is a loot chest too.
How to solve the Lincolnscire treasure hoard clue
This clue reads:
&ldquo;To the east of Lincolnscire, in Skegi&rsquo;s Beard, there lies a stretch of coast detached by the angry sea. From my guard tower wherein lies my dearest of properties, I watch over this land, guarding against the invasion of the barbarians who never cease. This hoard possesses the last relics of the Kingdom of Lindsey, and I forever shall defend it. Aellen of Mercia.&rdquo;
Skegi&rsquo;s Beard is towards the centre of the eastern coast of Lincolnshire - it looks like a large lake on the map.
The treasure hoard is at the top of the tower near the northeastern shore of the lake.
This treasure is the Speki Symbol Scheme (Front). This is a tattoo that Eivor can equip in the Ravensthorpe settlement.
How to find the Jorvik treasure hoard clue
This clue is in the Minster, close to the northerly synchronisation point in the city of Jorvik.
To enter, find the open window on the southern side, close to where the tower is. From there, head to the passage on the opposite side of the altar to find a slideable set of shelves. Move them aside to find the clue.
How to solve the Jorvik treasure hoard clue
This treasure hoard clue reads:
&ldquo;From the top of Forseti&rsquo;s Rest, you will see a lady standing at the southern boundary of Jorvik, looking at the river day and night. The treasure is protected by her trained eye. She is a blessed one, eternally loyal to the relics of lost saints.&rdquo;
Forseti&rsquo;s Rest is a tower between the fork of the river in the south of Jorvik. From there, the statue can be seen clearly to the south. Otherwise, just head to the western bank of the river before it forks and you will see the statue.

How to solve the Suthsexe Witch&rsquo;s house treasure hoard clue
This clue is a sketch:
This chalk figure is in eastern Suthsexe. It&rsquo;s a little difficult to spot on the map unless zoomed in: it&rsquo;s close to a lake and there&rsquo;s also a Fly Agaric mystery here.

Look past the forgotten stone portals and past the top of the hill. You will find me ambushed by a family of trees. There my luster lingers. The voice of saint Eanfleda.&rdquo;
Minninglow is marked on the map in the far south of Snotinghamscire, close to Repton just across the border.
Very slightly west of the map marker there is a well in a patch of snow. The treasure can be found next to it.

This clue is a puzzle that reads:
&ldquo;In the south and western corner of Hamtunscire, lost in Wishtman&rsquo;s Wood, I ran from the devil with my riches. Fatigued like a hunting hound, the darkness of the trees sending shivers in my spine, an endless fog clouding my vision, a tree of holy red, placed by the Holy Spirit and marked with the Blood of Christ: here. I paid my divine commissions, I gave my wealth to the ancient reliquary, and the Lord pardoned my fees.&rdquo;
Wishtman&rsquo;s Wood is not too far west in Hamtunscire, just north of the town and synchronisation point of Wertham.

How to solve the Potion of Strength treasure hoard clue
This clue is a letter that reads:
&ldquo;My distant cousin, a venerable elderly druid as am I, lives across seas in Francia. He taught me the makings of a miraculous potion! It gives whoever drinks it powerful strength.

May the spirits be with me.&rdquo;
Do exactly what the letter says and head north until you come across a large selection of stones. Near one of the stones is the treasure.
The treasure is the Norse-Gael Scheme tattoo for Eivor&rsquo;s arms.
The clue for the Connacht treasure hoard is located on the lone island, West of Connacht. Climb the island (but not to the very top) and you&rsquo;ll see a footpath of stone that you can walk around.
Do so, and you&rsquo;ll eventually come across an area that&rsquo;s blocked off and can only be broken open with via an Explosive Arrow or a fire barrel. Inside you&rsquo;ll find the Connacht treasure hoard clue.
How to solve the Connacht treasure hoard clue
This clue is an actual map. It shows a wooded area, as well as circle that&rsquo;s drawn to be a well. This one is tougher to find, but if you can match the outline of the area, you&rsquo;ll realize it&rsquo;s actually the small island just east of Lough Gara.

This clue is a letter from the friend of a dead preist. It reads:
&ldquo;Though you do not believe in the earth spirits and pray to your one god, the wind spirits tell me the signs are clear. Do not journey to your wife&rsquo;s crypt. Unlike me and the other peaceful druids, the druids of Kiltober have turned to darkness. They are determined to destroy your kind. Your wife now exists wherever you find yourself, no need to make dangerous pilgrimages! Your pagan friend, Mara.&rdquo;
Unfortunately the poor priest did make his visit, and as such his remains have been ransacked by the druids in Kiltober. Go and give them a visit, clearing out their camp. With Odin&rsquo;s sight you&rsquo;ll be led towards a door, open it and you&rsquo;ll find a skeleton and some opal. Search the skeleton and you&rsquo;ll find the treasure.
The treasure is the Norse-Gael Scheme tattoo for Eivor&rsquo;s face.
Where to find the Dream of Druids treasure hoard clue

How to solve the Dream of Druids treasure hoard clue
This clue is a poem. It reads:
&ldquo;The stones stand
In silent circle
Water washed
Spirit inspired
The northernmost lough
In all Connacht
Center yourself there&rdquo;
This one is fairly simple, as the northernmost lough in the entirety of Connacht is Lough Gara. It isn&rsquo;t too far away from where the poem is found either, so all you need to do is head to the Lough and stand in the very middle of the circular pond. There you&rsquo;ll find the treasure.
The treasure is the Norse-Gael Scheme tattoo for Eivor&rsquo;s torso.

How to solve the Ulster treasure hoard clue

How to solve the Last Days of the Village treasure hoard clue
This clue is a letter. It reads:
&ldquo;The plague-stricken village turned to me, a druid, after a bishop had tried to chase away &rsquo;evil spirits.&rsquo; Gathered beneath the moon, we prayed to the goddess, not for survival, but for a joyful journey to the place of the dead. Each villager thanked me in their final moments. My last duty was to collect their treasure and offer them to the sun spirit. They are hidden on the coast, out of view of the setting sun.&rdquo;
This treasure is much simpler to find, as all you&rsquo;ll need to do is keep heading west until you reach a cliff. Jump down into the water and head inwards and you&rsquo;ll discover a boat and a cave. Head inside that cave and you&rsquo;ll be able to collect the treasure.

Where to find the Melun treasure hoard clue

There you will find some ruins with water pouring into them and a man surrounded by his dead comrades. You can safely ignore him for now, however, and instead break the crates to his left in order to find a key. The key opens the door to his right.
Inside, along with a lootable chest, you will find an explosive oil jar. Carefully carry this back outside and behind the waterfall to find the wall that needs blowing up. Behind it, you will find the clue.
This clue is a map. You can check the map at any time from the bottom section of the Inventory Bag in the inventory menu.
How to solve the Melun treasure hoard clue

This treasure is the Ouroburos Scheme (Back). This is a tattoo design that Eivor can apply when they are back in the settlement.
Where to find the Paris treasure hoard clue
The Paris treasure hoard clue can be found at the Saint-Denis church, to the north of the area.
There is a door on the western side of the church. It is barred but from the outside, so give it a good whack to open it. Turn left, avoiding and chasing away the rats, to hop over the boxes.
Climb up the bookshelf on the left, jump across to the balcony on the other wall, and climb up through the small hole to the next level. There are more rats here so keep climbing, up the bell and another balcony to the wooden struts.
Finally you will reach the top of the tower where the clue is waiting for you. Break the crates and move the shelves aside for an easy exit.
This clue is a map. You can check the map at any time from the bottom section of the Inventory Bag in the inventory menu.
