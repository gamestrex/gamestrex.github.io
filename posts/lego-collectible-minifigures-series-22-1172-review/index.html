Space Creature Space Creature Roboters are specialized in repair.\nTechnical technicians in mechanical repair. The robot repair tech has an yellow welding suit with printed detailing on the front with a key on the back and an electric warning on the back. A single piece of the horn can be used with a wrench or a drill. The legs are twin-shaped with more robotic printing. The head is gray, with some circuits on both sides. The front shows a smile while the back is in a battery mode. The welding helmet also gives happy eyes. This accessory includes a hammer and a little robot-friendly companion.\nChili costume fan. She wears a dark red outfit that reflects a fiery chili on the torso. His double sided head shows her smiling one side and her sweating one side. Outside of her costume, she also has a spare red hairpiece. The chili mold is new and is a paste from that restaurant. Her food is a carton of milk.\nTroubadour The Troubadour wears a striped blue outfit with an embroidered collar. The legs are striped with lots of black boots. His head shows him a small mustache and a smiling expression. He wears an orange pendence hat with a magenta feather. Her accessories include a mandolin and gold coins.\nSnow Guardian The Snow Guardian has white coats with blue accents and furry collar pieces that he brings around his neck. His belt shows he’s an aplenty of wolf clans, and the snowflake emblem also has. His double-sided head shows him with calm expression on one side and stern expression on the other. He has a furry hat for a complete look. His accessory items include a sword and shield, with the snowflake emblem. The husky companion has blue eyes.\nHorse and bird. The girl has yellow plaids and medium blue legs. His wide face resembles a smile and smiles show that she has beautiful hair on the other side. Her hair is made of dark red cap. Her accessory is a carrot, almost her size and a brown foal.\nSculpturer’s champion. The Figureskating Champion has a light blue outfit with metallic silver glitter on the hip. His head gives him an energetic expression. His accessories include a trophy and a pair of skates. He also has a clear action photo put in which he takes the legs to show him how moving.\nNight Protector The Night Protector is usually dark grey with purple accents on the torso and the legs. There’s an orange jewel in the middle of the chest, and the belt shows the moon’s emblem. On the back of the torso is the right moon symbol, too. She is scaly with her legs. Her hair is smiling on one side and a smile on the other. Her accessories include a trans-purple sword and a shield with the moon symbol again.\nForest Elf The Forest Elf has a green outfit with a leaflike design. The belt has some acorn and leaf designs. He wears a soft, leaf-shaped cape around his neck. His double-sided head looks beautiful on both sides. He wears acorn and acorn caps. His accessories include a stick, and an mushroom with a face. If you were playing MapleStory, the mushroom is the kind of thing that reminds me of that.\nBirdwatcher is a birdwatcher. The Birdwatcher has an black short-sleeve shirt printed on one of the arms. The cargo pants are molded with pockets in the back and brown boots. Her double-sided head shows a smirk on the one side and a nervous smile on the other. His hair is made with the teal cap, too. Her accessories include a bag with an magenta or green binoculars. A little while is also included in the discussion.\nCostumes Fan at Raccoon. The Raccoon Costume Fan is a more attractive addition to animal figurines. The trash hats are quite bland with the little torso just showing a little fur on the front. There’s a tail piece to add between the hands and the torso. This helmet shows the minifigures face on your typical animal head. She doubled on her side and with smiles on both sides. There is also a separate hair piece with which it shows that she is an older woman. Her accessories include a green trash can and a white trash bag.\nSpace Creature The space art has the original purple torso and the Classic Space logo, I think. The arms on them are printed, too. The legs are purple with some detail on them, too. The head is made up of two pieces with the head piece holding a double-sided face and with two different smiles. The eyes are on the head and the plastic is soft. The teen also has a holler and a trans-green canister on the back.\nWheelchair Racer The Wheelchair Racer has an illuminated blue outfit that looks somewhat like the adidas logo. He wears a medal around his neck and has a light blue helmet. That wheelchair is white and has blue wheels on the front and solid black wheels on the back. The minifigure’s included is a clear 11 round brick so that the wheelchair can be placed on the baseplate.\nResults The series 22 LEGO Collectible Minifigures (71032) all have an array of different characters that you can add to your collection. Some of them are pretty unique and such as the Troubadour and Night Protector, while others are pretty generic and can be easily added to many settings like the Birdwatcher and the Groom area. Of course there are the mascots that are all popular. If you should choose my favorite spacecraft, it’ll probably be the Spacecreature for me, just because I can now have a purple Classic space torso. This night protector is very close second, because she has a lot of nice detailing throughout. The Wheelchair Racer is a part of LEGO’s mission of diversity and inclusion.

Of course there are the mascots that are all popular.
If you should choose my favorite spacecraft, it’ll probably be the Spacecreature for me, just because I can now have a purple Classic space torso. This night protector is very close second, because she has a lot of nice detailing throughout. The Wheelchair Racer is a part of LEGO’s mission of diversity and inclusion.

author: &ldquo;Juan Winslow&rdquo;</h2><h3 id=breakdown-1>Breakdown<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#breakdown-1>#</a></h3><p>Per complete box of thirty people, there are three sets of miniature figures. Depending on how LEGO packages them, they should have a certain pattern each minifigure goes in if youre looking for something new or that’s not confirmed for now unless more box-related stuff go online. I have a box that turned the front of the box into the back, to which I had to put it on.
