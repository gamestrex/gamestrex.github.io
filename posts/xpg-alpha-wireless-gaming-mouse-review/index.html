These Categories are:\nDesign \u0026 Comfort Functionality Features Durability\nIf a Gaming Mouse can satisfy the above Categories, then you can consider it a good one. I have been testing out the XPG Alpha Wireless for a week now \u0026 here is what I have to say about it.\nDesign \u0026 Comfort The XPG Alpha Wireless has an amazing Ergonomic Design that fits snuggly for a palm of most sizes. It is lightweight and has a great Curve design that allows the fingers to rest well on it. If you are a Gamer, then you will like the Mouse as you can use any of the Hand Grips to hold the Mouse, be it for a MOBA game like League of Legends or an FPS game like Apex Legends. The XPG Alpha Wireless Gaming Mouse has RGB Lights in it that display the XPG logo, the Mouse Wheel, \u0026 the underside of the Mouse Buttons. The mouse has 6 unique Buttons that are Tactile and feel fantastic to use. If you are a person who loves the clicky sound of buttons then this Mouse will be a treat for you. The XPG Alpha Wireless Gaming Mouse also comes with a Thumb rest on it to avoid unnecessary Thumb drag or to slow your movements. XPG has designed this Mouse with their patented :Exoskeleton design. This design aims to synergize the strengths of both performance and function with aesthetics. For the most part, they have succeeded in doing just that. The Mouse is super comfortable to handle and works like a Charm when it comes to Gaming. The Wired Cable comes with grooves that lock it in place, making sure it doesn’t come loose. I haven’t done a lot of Headshots in FPS games recently but the Mouse helped me complete my Headshot Quests.\nXPG Alpha Wireless Functionality Review The XPG Alpha Wireless is a Gaming Mouse \u0026 as such thrives in the competitive environment. The Wireless Mouse has 3 modes of connecting to a PC, i.e. 2.4G, Wired, \u0026 Bluetooth 5.1. Bluetooth 5.1 is more for more leisure use of the Mouse as it is not the fastest way of communication between the Mouse \u0026 PC. On the other hand, the 2.4G \u0026 Wired options are perfect. Wired is always the best option no matter the situation but the 2.4G option has been very accurate \u0026 responsive. The XPG Alpha Wireless Gaming Mouse comes with 6 Buttons. Each of them can be mapped to whatever Function you want, well except for the DPI button. For a Gamer, the extra two buttons become very helpful for certain important keybinds. This could be for Communication or even for a quick Weapon or Skill use. On top of that, the DPI button can be mapped to have a DPI level of 100 to 16,000 very easily. So you can flip between Slow \u0026 Accurate movement to Quick \u0026 Instant movement with a click of a button. As I have mentioned above, clicking heads in a game like CS:GO or Valorant feels amazing \u0026 crisp. If you feel like a Headshot Demon then this mouse will make you a Monster, no cap. You will be accused of hacking, trust me I was. Jokes aside, the mouse is pretty solid \u0026 in tense situations and has helped me Clutch rounds.\nFeatures There are numerous features that the XPG Alpha Wireless Mouse has. here is a list of what it has:\nInterface – USB Type-C Connection – Wireless 2.4G / Bluetooth 5.1 / Wired Battery Life – Up to 60 hours Sensor – PAW 3335 Resolution – 100-16,000 (via PRIME) IPS – 400 Max. Acceleration – 40 G Polling Rate – 250 / 500 / 1000 Hz (via PRIME) Switch – OMRON with 60-million clicks rating Lighting Effect – RGB (PRIME Support) Voltage – 5 V Current – 410 mA Material – PC + ABS Buttons – 6 Dimension – 128 x 78 x 40mm (5.04 x 3.07 x 1.57 in) Weight – 98 ±5g (without cable) Cable Length – 1.8 m (5.9 ft) Certification – CE/FCCIC/BSMI/NCC/VCCI/TELEC OS Compatibility – Windows PRIME Support – v\nThis is what you will get by purchasing the XPG Alpha Wireless Gaming Mouse. The Mouse has XPG PRIME support. XPG PRIME is a dedicated Software that allows the user to adjust \u0026 edit the Mouse as per their liking. From the Lighting to the DPI, you can set it all. You can rebind Keys \u0026 set Profiles for what you need. The XPG PRIME is the perfect tool and has been a blessing to use. Some of the options the XPG PRIME offers are pretty limited but if you log in with your credentials, you will unlock more Features. As I have mentioned above, you can set up three profiles for what you need. The DPI Button scroll between one to six various DPI options that you have set in the XPG PRIME software by changing the number of Steps.\nDurability The XPG Alpha Wireless Gaming Mouse is pretty Solid \u0026 durable. The Mouse can take some Fall Damage as well as the slams while Gaming. I am a Low-Sens guy, so I often lift and drop the mouse. The XPG Alpha Wireless managed to survive all that slamming, especially when things got heated. You know, Valorant can be painful sometimes. Although it is Solid, it has a Plastic Body. So I do not recommend you fling it to a Wall or the Floor. If you manage to avoid that, the Mouse will go on for a long time. The XPG Alpha Wireless Gaming Mouse has over 60 hours of battery life. I can vouch for this as I used it constantly at 2.4G mode which consumes a lot of Battery. The Mouse went for the whole week without Charging. Even if the Battery drains out, you can charge it up for an hour \u0026 get almost a Day of use out of it.\nVerdict The XPG Alpha Wireless Gaming Mouse is pretty Solid \u0026 amazing. Although I have praised the Mouse a lot in this Review, there are a few Cons to the Mouse. First Off, the XPG Alpha Wireless Mouse costs about 4782.58 INR. That is a pretty hefty price considering that most Gaming Mice have better Specs \u0026 Designs. Secondly, the Wire that comes with the Mouse is not as malleable and can be a nuisance to deal with. Another problem is if the Wire gets ruined, then you will have to order it from XPG as a Third-party USB Type-C cable will not work. If you can deal with it, then the XPG Alpha Wireless can become a good option for you. The XPG Alpha Wireless has a Wired variant that is around 1.5K cheaper but is not as worth it as the other options available. The XPG Alpha Wireless on the other hand is pretty good for its price. In my opinion, purchasing the XPG Alpha Wireless is a pretty good deal \u0026 worth it. This was all about the XPG Alpha Wireless Gaming Mouse Review. Hopefully, this guide has helped you.
