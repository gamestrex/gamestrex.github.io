Phase 2 is then scheduled to end on Tuesday, 17th January 2022, when the time will come the day after to prepare for a new update with a new set of Banners in version 3.4. Genshin Impact version 3.3 is here, with new codes, and new character Scaramouche (Wanderer), so find out where he’s placed on our tier list. You’ll need Primogems and luck of the Pity and 50/50 systems to Wish with Fate for him and other current and next banners. You’ll also need the right Adventure Rank for events. For more Sumeru help, we’ve got pages on Sumeru Reputation, Tree of Dreams, Dendroculus locations, the Aeonblight Drake boss, the Garden of Endless Pillars Domain, and locations for Nilotpala Lotus, Padisarah, Scarabs, and Redcrest.\rYou can also now unlock the Genius Invokation TCG and, if you want help building your deck, check out our Genius Invokation TCG Card List.\rIf you want to relax, however, why not try fishing at one of the many fishing spot locations?\nGenshin Impact 3.3 events In addition to the ‘Inversion of Genesis’ Archon Quest Interlude Chapter, the Genius Invokation TCG permanent gameplay mode, double rewards from a Ley Line Overflow period, and two new sets of Artifacts, we’re getting four limited-time events during the 3.3 update to Genshin Impact.\nGenshin Impact Misty Dungeon: Realm of Sand event Misty Dungeon: Realm of Sand starts on Friday, 9th December and ends on Monday, 19th December. You need to be Adventure Rank 20 in order to take part. A new version of Misty Dungeon is coming in version 3.3! This time around, there will be seven trials, each with different themes. Each trial has a different Ley Line Disorder, so you’ll have to change your teams depending on the effects of these Ley Lines, and who the upcoming enemies are. Helpfully, there will be some trial characters you can choose from to help you out. After entering the Misty Dungeon: Realm of Sand domain, you’ll need to complete three challenges to collect Ancient Runes before taking on the main combat trial. While searching for Ancient Runes, you can also take on optional mechanisms and challenges to increase the Ley Line Disorders’ effects, or revive and heal your team. The rewards you can earn from the Misty Dungeon: Realm of Sand event include:\nPrimogems Mora Character Ascension Materials Weapon Ascension Materials Character EXP Materials\nGenshin Impact Akitsu Kimodameshi event Akitsu Kimodameshi starts on Thursday, 15th December and ends on Monday, 2nd January 2023. You need to be Adventure Rank 30 and have completed the ‘Ritou Escape Plan’ as part of the Chapter 2, Act 1 Archon quest ‘The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia’ in order to take part. If you haven’t completed Itto’s Story Quest, you can still take part by selecting ‘Quick Start’ from the main events menu. The Akitsu Kimodameshi event consists of ‘Test of Courage’ challenges that are hosted by the Yashiro Commission. There are a few different challenge types according to the 3.3 livestream, but the main one highlighted has you destroying bricks by controlling a platform that a ball bounces off. Basically, if you’ve ever played Peggle, you’ll be right at home. Giving the Peggle formula a more Genshin-themed twist, however, is the inclusion of Elemental Reactions. Depending on what character you’re using to control the platform that the ball bounces off, the ball will change its elemental type. You’ll need to take advantage of this by switching to different characters throughout the challenges to clear the bricks within the time limit. You’ll also get to set modifiers to make things easier. There will also be event stories occurring throughout Akitsu Kimodameshi. Although we don’t know what characters will be featured just yet, we expect an appearance from the one and Oni himself, Arataki Itto, and the Raiden Shogun or Ei, considering they are two Inazuma characters who have Banner reruns in 3.3. As this is the main event of version 3.3, there will also be an event shop to spend the currency you earn from the Akitsu Kimodameshi challenges. The rewards you can earn from the Akitsu Kimodameshi event include:\nToukabou Shigure 4-Star sword and Parasol Talcum refinement materials for it Primogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Weapon Ascension Materials Talent Level-Up Materials Character EXP Materials Crown of Insight\nGenshin Impact Windtrace event Windtrace starts on Friday, 23rd December and ends on Friday, 6th January 2023. You only need to be Adventure Rank 20 in order to take part. The Windtrace hide-and-seek event is back - but there’s a few alterations this time around. If you’ve never taken part in one of these hide-and-seek events, the general gist is that there are two sides - the Rebels and the Hunter - with the Hunter’s task to try and catch all of the Rebels before the time limit. The Hunter wins if they catch all the Rebels, but the Rebels win if they manage to avoid the Hunter. For the Windtrace event in version 3.3 however, there is a new Observer mode that has been added to the Rebels side. This means if you get caught, you can still help your team by becoming invisible and using the ‘Illusory Beacon’ skill, which allows you to place a beacon to confuse the Hunter if they select it, obscuring their vision. New Windward Arts have also been added for both the Rebels and the Hunter, with the net for the Hunter keeping things fair by allowing them to destroy Illusory Beacons without obscuring their vision. As always, Windtrace is available in co-op. The rewards you can earn from the Windtrace event include:\nPrimogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Weapon Ascension Materials Character EXP Materials\nGenshin Impact Across the Wilderness event Across the Wilderness starts on Tuesday, 3rd January and ends on Friday, 13th January 2023. Youneed to be at least Adventure Rank 20, and have completed Prologue - Act 3: Song of the Dragon and Freedom in order to take part. For Across the Wilderness in version 3.3 you have to collect Wilderness Balloons in a race event taking place across Teyvat. The more balloons you collect within the time limit, the better the rewards will be. You’ll need to select your characters carefully, utilising their exploration skills to collect as many balloons as you can. Additionally, you’ll be able to use something called a ‘Travel Compass’ to configure your skills to give your team extra buffs like enhanced jumping abilities and increased movement speed. You’ll only be able to claim one buff per challenge, however. This event can also be played in co-op. The rewards you can earn from the Across the Wilderness event include:\nPrimogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Talent Level-Up Materials Character EXP Materials\nGenshin Impact 3.3 release date and time in UK, GMT, CET, EST and PST Genshin Impact 3.3 will release on Wednesday, 7th December.

The rewards you can earn from the Akitsu Kimodameshi event include:</p><p>Toukabou Shigure 4-Star sword and Parasol Talcum refinement materials for it Primogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Weapon Ascension Materials Talent Level-Up Materials Character EXP Materials Crown of Insight</p><h3 id=genshin-impact-windtrace-event>Genshin Impact Windtrace event<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-windtrace-event>#</a></h3><p>Windtrace starts on Friday, 23rd December and ends on Friday, 6th January 2023. You only need to be Adventure Rank 20 in order to take part.
The Windtrace hide-and-seek event is back - but there&rsquo;s a few alterations this time around.
If you&rsquo;ve never taken part in one of these hide-and-seek events, the general gist is that there are two sides - the Rebels and the Hunter - with the Hunter&rsquo;s task to try and catch all of the Rebels before the time limit. The Hunter wins if they catch all the Rebels, but the Rebels win if they manage to avoid the Hunter.
For the Windtrace event in version 3.3 however, there is a new Observer mode that has been added to the Rebels side. This means if you get caught, you can still help your team by becoming invisible and using the &lsquo;Illusory Beacon&rsquo; skill, which allows you to place a beacon to confuse the Hunter if they select it, obscuring their vision.
New Windward Arts have also been added for both the Rebels and the Hunter, with the net for the Hunter keeping things fair by allowing them to destroy Illusory Beacons without obscuring their vision.
As always, Windtrace is available in co-op.
The rewards you can earn from the Windtrace event include:</p><p>Primogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Weapon Ascension Materials Character EXP Materials</p><h3 id=genshin-impact-across-the-wilderness-event>Genshin Impact Across the Wilderness event<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-across-the-wilderness-event>#</a></h3><p>Across the Wilderness starts on Tuesday, 3rd January and ends on Friday, 13th January 2023. Youneed to be at least Adventure Rank 20, and have completed Prologue - Act 3: Song of the Dragon and Freedom in order to take part.
For Across the Wilderness in version 3.3 you have to collect Wilderness Balloons in a race event taking place across Teyvat. The more balloons you collect within the time limit, the better the rewards will be.
You&rsquo;ll need to select your characters carefully, utilising their exploration skills to collect as many balloons as you can. Additionally, you&rsquo;ll be able to use something called a &lsquo;Travel Compass&rsquo; to configure your skills to give your team extra buffs like enhanced jumping abilities and increased movement speed. You&rsquo;ll only be able to claim one buff per challenge, however.
This event can also be played in co-op.
The rewards you can earn from the Across the Wilderness event include:</p><p>Primogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Talent Level-Up Materials Character EXP Materials</p><h2 id=genshin-impact-33-release-date-and-time-in-uk-gmt-cet-est-and-pst>Genshin Impact 3.3 release date and time in UK, GMT, CET, EST and PST<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#genshin-impact-33-release-date-and-time-in-uk-gmt-cet-est-and-pst>#</a></h2><p>Genshin Impact 3.3 will release on Wednesday, 7th December. It follows the usual maintenance schedule for new updates, with 3.3 releasing approximately five hours after server downtime starting at 6am (UTC +8), so will be available from 11am (UTC +8).
As this is only an approximate time for how long the servers are down, you might be able to play the 3.3 patch a little before or after the times below - although previous update estimates have been fairly accurate.
For other time zones, the Genshin Impact 3.3 release date and time is:</p><p>UK: Wednesday, 7th December, 3am (GMT) Europe: Wednesday, 7th December, 4am (CET) East Coast US: Tuesday, 6th December, 10pm (EST) Central US: Tuesday 6th December, 9pm (CST) West Coast US:Tuesday 6th December, 7pm (PST) Australia: Wednesday, 7th December, 2pm (AET) New Zealand: Wednesday, 7th December, 4pm (NZST) Japan: Wednesday, 7th December, 12pm (JST)</p><p>You can pre-install some 3.3 content now on PC and Mobile devices in advance to save time when the actual patch is available on Wednesday.
If you play on Mobile, either press the &lsquo;Pre-Install Resource Package&rsquo; icon in the bottom-left corner of the login screen, or go to the Paimon Menu and select &lsquo;Settings&rsquo;, &lsquo;Other&rsquo;, and finally &lsquo;Pre-Install Resource Package&rsquo;.
When the full update arrives, those on iOS devices must enter the App Store and tap &lsquo;Update&rsquo;. Android users can open the game and follow the directions on-screen or open Google Play and tap &lsquo;Update&rsquo;.
If you play Genshin Impact on PC, you can pre-install some of the 3.3 update by updating the Genshin Impact Launcher. After updating the launcher, a &lsquo;Game Pre-Installation&rsquo; button will appear to the left of the &lsquo;Launch&rsquo; button. Click &lsquo;Game Pre-Installation&rsquo; to download the 3.3 resources.
Hope you have fun during version 3.3!</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Genshin-Impact-3.3-Banners-Phase-1-Scaramouch-and-Itto.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Genshin-Impact-3.3-Banners-Phase-1-Scaramouch-and-Itto.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Genshin Impact 3 3 Banner and event details -
