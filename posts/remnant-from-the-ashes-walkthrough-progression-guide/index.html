Now, go back to Commander Ford again and this time, she will hand over you a key that can be used on a terminal in the room where the Red Crystal is located. Activate the Crystal by using the Computer and get yourself teleported to Earth.\nEarth When you use the Crystal, you will find yourself at Earth inside The Founder’s Hideout. On the upper level, you will find a bookshelf, which has an opening behind it. You will have to break those bookshelves and crouch to pass through. When you get inside the room, you will find Drifter’s Overcoat and Trousers. Once obtained, head back to the main room and find items and Ward 13 Keycard. Once found, you will have to exit the building and keep running on the streets until you find an entrance to the sewer, taking you to the first checkpoint and dungeon. Once you have successfully cleared dungeons, you will get to the Earth’s streets again. Make sure to keep going until you see a church. Go inside the church and meet with The Root Mother. When you meet her, an event will commence, asking you to defend her for two minutes. Once the event is concluded, she will ask you to meet her back at Ward 13. While exploring the church, you will find the Sniper Rifle in the basement. You will have to find another checkpoint that will lead you to the backside of Ward 13. Once you get there, talk to the Root Mother and she will ask you to find a Tower, which is located in the City leading you to The Labyrinth. Now, it is time to get yourself teleported back to the Earth and explore until you kill a World boss that could be The Ent or Singe. Once you are done defeating the boss, you will see a Tower dropping from the Sky into the city. Go to the base of the tower and you will be teleported inside.\nThe Labyrinth Once you get inside the tower, meet with Keeper Of The Labyrinth. After a brief conversation with him, he will take you to The Labyrinth. There, you will find three portals. The one located on the left side leads you to Corsus. The one forward takes you to Rhom and the one located on the right leads you to Yaesha. Currently, you can only enter the one that leads to Rhom. Activate it to enter.\nRhom When you enter, you will get to meet with an NPC that has enough information about the World. After getting information from him, you will have to keep going until you come across a Big Monolith with a checkpoint beneath it. After exploring the desert, go through the dungeons until you come across the World Boss named Claviger or The Harrow. Irrespective of which boss you encounter, you will have to defeat them. Once defeated, you will get the Howling Key that can be used to open the Black Sun Gate, which is located near the entrance to Rhom. When you get inside the building, you will meet with the Undying King, he will ask you to retrieve the Guardian’s Heart from Corsus. Now, it is up to you to accept or reject his offer. If you reject the Undying King’s offer, you will have to fight with him and defeat him. Once defeated, you will get the Labyrinth Key, which can be used to enter the Corsus and Yaesha. If you accept his offer, he will open a portal that leads to Corsus. You can either bring him the Guardian’s Heart or betray him once you have got your hands on it. Go inside the portal to Corsus.\nCorsus When you get inside the Corsus, you will find a checkpoint. While exploring the area, you will find a huge hut. When you get inside it, you will have to fight with The Unclean One. Once defeated, you will gain access to yet another checkpoint and there you will get to meet with the Islak Queen. When you meet her, she will ask you to defeat the Guardian of her world and present the Guardian’s Heart. To get the Guardian’s Heart in Remnant From The Ashes, you will have to defeat Ixillis. When you defeat Ixillis, you will be given the Guardian’s Heart as a reward. Once you have obtained it, you will have the following choices:\nGive it to the Iskal Queen and get Slayer Set +8 and Crossbow +8. Give it to The Undying King and get Riven and The Labyrinth Key. Keep the Guardian’s Heat and fight with The Undying King.\nYaesha Once you have got the Labyrinth Key, teleport to The Labyrinth and enter the portal found on the right part. When you get inside the port, you will find a huge forest in Yaesha. You will have to explore Yaesha until you find an event asking you to shit stand a siege. Once you have successfully defended the siege, you will meet with Navun. When you talk with her, she will ask you that Founder Ford has been taken captive by the Immortal Empress. You will have to keep exploring until you find the World Boss The Ravager or Totem Father. You will be granted access to the Prison where Founder Ford is held captive after defeating the World Boss. Explore the prison and fire at the lock to gain access to Founder Ford. When you have a talk with him, he will tell you that you need to reach Ward 17 to end the Root advance on earth. There, you will be given the Founder’s Key.\nWard 17 Now, you will need to head back to Ward 17 and go to the lowest level. While exploring the area, you will witness a room, which has a mirror inside. In the same room, you will find a Computer with a Key slot. You will have to use the Founder’s Key on the Key slot to gain access to the Computer to initialize the mirror. When you go through the mirror, you will find yourself in Ward 17, which is an empty location. After reaching Ward 17, you will have to keep going until you find a checkpoint. There, you will find a room. When you get inside the room, you will find the last boss named Dreamer.
