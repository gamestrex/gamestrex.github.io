Finding apples will increase Kratos’ maximum health, and finding horns increases Kratos’ maximum Rage. Each upgrade costs more each time, however, costing five apples or horns to improve health and Rage by the end of the game. Svartalfheim: Alfheim: Vanaheim - Jungle: Vanaheim - Crater: Midgard: Muspelheim: Niflheim: These rewards alternate every chest you open. So you’ll get an Idunn Apple the first time you open any Nornir Chest, then a Horn of the Blood Mead for the next one, then an apple, and so on until you open 30 Nornir Chests. When you open the remaining five chests, you’ll get other rewards, such as Hacksilver, Shattered Rune materials, and weapon Enchantments. However, if you only want to get the ‘Full Belly’ Trophy, then you just need to find the 30 Runic Chests containing the apples and horns. Every Nornir Chest can only be opened once the three runes surrounding it have been destroyed, lit on fire, spun, or had their bell rung. Finding the runes is sometimes the hardest part, but it’s usually working out how to destroy, light, or ring the runes that makes the puzzles so difficult. It’s important to remember that you won’t be able to unlock every Nornir Chest you find the first time you visit a Realm, as you’ll need to get special equipment or abilities that let you solve the puzzles first. These are all obtained during the story, so don’t worry about not being able to open them straight away. We recommend solving the puzzles you can when you come across them, but waiting until after - or close to - the end of the game to go hunting for all the Nornir Chests in Ragnarök.\nGod of War Ragnarök Svartalfheim Nornir chest locations explained There are 10 Nornir Chests in Svartalfheim, with five accessible the first time you visit the dwarven Realm. Here’s where to find all ten Nornir Chests in Svartalfheim:\nSvartalfheim Aurvangar Wetlands Nornir Chest puzzle solution 1 and location in God of War Ragnarök The first Nornir Chest in Svartalfheim is located in the Aurvangar Wetlands, in the area with the geysers you need to freeze in order to cross and find a way to turn the large wooden wheel in the water to get past it in the boat. Go right when you freeze the first geyser after docking the boat to locate the Nornir Chest. To open it, you need to destroy the three runes by throwing your axe at them. The first rune you need to destroy is directly to the right of the chest. The second rune is on an inaccessible island behind and to the left of the chest. Throw your axe to reach it. To get to the third rune, go back and freeze the geyser under the platform above the chest. You can now jump up and destroy the last rune, which is located under a tree.\nSvartalfheim Aurvangar Wetlands Nornir Chest puzzle solution 2 and location in God of War Ragnarök The second Runic Chest in the Aurvangar Wetlands of Svartalfheim is located on the island you find by going under the small wooden bridge in the boat near the Legendary Chest on a ledge, accessed before solving the puzzle to open the door into the next area. Go right once you dock the boat to find the chest. To open it, you need to spin the golden circles above the three runes by hitting them with your axe until the correct one is displayed. The first spinner is located to the right of the Nornir Chest, but you’ll need to freeze the geyser by throwing your axe at it first to see what symbol is currently displayed. For this spinner, we want the ‘P’ symbol to display. Hit the paddles with the axe, then freeze the geyser to make sure it’s the ‘P’ rune, then move on. The second spinner is found around the corner from the first spinner, above the drop. Throw your axe at one of the paddles until the ‘B’ rune is displayed. The third spinner is located near the Legendary Chest in the upper left-hand corner of this area. Go up the wall on the left and turn around to see the spinner, then hit the paddles until the ‘N’ rune appears.\nSvartalfheim Dragon Beach Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök You’ll find the Dragon Beach Nornir Chest at the back of the area, under a geyser. For this puzzle, you need to find the three runes and destroy them with your axe. The first rune is behind the geyser by the Nornir Chest. You’ll have to freeze the geyser with your axe first to see exactly where to throw it through the water to destroy it. The second rune is behind the gate near a crane you can use Sonic Arrows to damage. You’ll have to go around the rocks on its right to hit from behind, though. The third rune is behind another geyser, located beside the other crane you can damage with Sonic Arrows, near the coast. Freeze the geyser to see exactly where it is, then recall and hit the rune behind the water.\nSvartalfheim Radsvinn’s Rig Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök You’ll find the Radsvinn’s Rig Nornir Chest on top of the rig itself, where the forge you have to destroy for the ‘In Service of Asgard’ Favour is. For this puzzle, you need to light three torches with your Blades of Chaos above where the runes are displayed. The first torch is just beside the chest, to the left. Aim with your Chaos Blades and use a heavy attack when close enough to light it. The second torch is located behind a metal fence to the right of the furnace in the middle. You’ll have to go up a level on the rig and hit the red jar with your axe to destroy it and light the torch in the resulting explosion. The third torch is found behind the furnace, but you’ll have to use Sonic Arrows to destroy the barrels in front of it before you can light it.\nSvartalfheim Alberich Island Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök You’ll find the Alberich Island Nornir Chest on your right as soon as you dock on the island. This is a bell ringing rune puzzle, which means you need to hit all three bells with your axe very quickly in order to unlock the chest. The first bell is behind a gate to the left of the chest, and this should be the first one you ring, as to access it you have to hit the wooden board to its left twice and then quickly throw your axe at the bell before it drops again. The second bell is found opposite the chest, but you’ll have to use Sonic Arrows on the crane glowing green that holds the bell in order to lower it. The third bell is located just above the chest. Ring the bells in this exact order and you’ll be able to hit them all before you run out of time. The rest of the Nornir Chests in Svartalfheim aren’t accessible until you get another weapon at The Forge when you return to Svartalfheim. Don’t read any further if you haven’t got this weapon, as you’ll be spoiled on what it is, and there are some possible story spoilers in the pictures!\nSvartalfheim Myrkr Tunnels Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök You’ll come across this Nornir Chest while progressing with the tunnels and returning to Svartalfheim through a special method made by Brok. The first torch is opposite the chest, so just use your blades to light it. The second torch is to the left of the chest, but it’s too far to reach with just Kratos’ blades. Use Sigil Arrows to make a path towards the torch, then light the bubbles with the Chaos Blades. Remember that you can make the purple bubbles bigger by firing another Sigil Arrow in the middle of one. The last torch is in the corridor opposite the chest, hidden behind some barrels. Destroy the barrels, then light the torch with the Chaos Blades.\nSvartalfheim Applecore Mines Nornir Chest puzzle solution 1 and location in God of War Ragnarök The first Nornir Chest in the Applecore Mines is near the start, down the rope zipline you can create when you have the spear. You’ll also need to use the spear on the wall near the end of this zipline to climb up and access the chest. To solve this Nornir Chest puzzle, you need to throw a spear at each rune, then detonate them at the same time. The first and second runes are on elevated wooden platforms to the left of the chest. The third rune is also to the left of the chest, but is on top of rocks instead, not on a platform.\nSvartalfheim Applecore Mines Nornir Chest puzzle solution 2 and location in God of War Ragnarök To get to the second Applecore Mines Nornir Chest, you need to go back to the room where you solved the water wheel puzzle by separating with Atreus in the story, all the way back in the beginning of the game. Go through the crawlspace on the right of this room and use your new spear on the wind spot on the room beyond to climb up and unlock a new Mystic Gateway. The Nornir Chest is right beside this gate. For this puzzle, you need to locate all three runes, throw a spear at each, then detonate them at the same time to destroy the runes. The first rune is directly opposite the Mystic Gateway. The second rune is around the corner, beside the Yggdrasil tear. Blow up the red jar to clear the debris and reveal it. The third rune is tricky to find, as you can’t actually see it. Go to the end of the platform, opposite the Yggdrasil tear, and look down at the water flowing to the right of the stationary cog. Your reticle will change when you’re aiming at where the rune is. Fire here, these detonate to blow up all three runes.\nSvartalfheim Jarnsmida Pitmines Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök Remember this one from early in the story? Well now you can solve it with your handy Sigil Arrows. Go through the gate beside the Mystic Gateway you found beside the last Applecore Nornir Chest to get back to the Jarnsmida Pitmines area, then use your spear to make your way back to this chest. This is a torch lighting rune puzzle, which means you need to light all three torches with your Chaos Blades to unlock the chest - but you’ll need Sigil Arrows to reach the torches. You’ve probably already lit the first torch, which is just beside and to the left of the chest. The second torch is opposite the chest and down the gap, to the left. To light it, you need to make a line of Sigil Arrows from the torch to Kratos and then light the nearest purple bubble with his Blades. Remember that you can make the bubbles bigger by firing more Sigil Arrows into the middle of a bubble. The last torch is down the jump to the left of the chest. Use your axe on the wooden trough above to stop the water falling on the torch, then light it with the Blades of Chaos.\nSvartalfheim The Forge Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök You can’t solve this Nornir Chest puzzle until you return to Svartalfheim as part of the story and get the spear. It’s in a nook just up from the entrance to the Myrkr Tunnels. To open this chest, you need to throw spears at the three runes, then detonate them at the same time to keep them from coming back. The first rune is located on the cliff to the left of the chest. The second rune is directly opposite the chest, on a small dent on the cliff. The third rune is on the path towards the mining carts, behind the rocks in the middle.\nGod of War Ragnarök Alfheim Nornir chest locations explained There are seven Nornir Chests in Alfheim, with four accessible the first time you visit the Elven Realm, two more available when you gain access to The Forbidden Sands with a new tool, and then the last one is only accessible by getting a new weapon as part of the story. Here’s where to find all Nornir Chests in Alfheim:\nAlfheim The Strond Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök You’ll find The Strond Nornir Chest down a drop after crawling through a wallspace, just ahead of the Mystic Gateway. This is a torch lighting rune puzzle, which means you need to light all three torches with your Chaos Blades to unlock the chest. The first torch is to the left of the Nornir Chest, on the cliff’s edge behind some rocks. The second torch is located at the back of this chest area, under the path on the left, near the cliff edge. The third torch is found in the same area as the second, but above the path. Climb up the wall on the right to reach it and light it, or light it from the higher path accessible on the main path towards the Temple of Light. The next Nornir Chest on The Strond is inaccessible until you get a specific tool later in the game, so ignore it for now.\nAlfheim Temple of Light Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök You’ll find the Temple of Light Nornir Chest in the room accessible by the wide light bridge Tyr helped Kratos and Atreus cross during the story inside the temple. This is past the white marble Legendary Chest puzzle, and the fights involving mobs of Light Elves and purple mirrors. This is a bell ringing rune puzzle, which means you need to hit all three bells with your axe very quickly in order to unlock the chest. The first bell is down the path behind the Nornir Chest, but to access it you’ll need to use Sonic Arrows to destroy the grate blocking it. When throwing the axe at the purple Twilight Stone to ring the bell, stand as far back towards the chest as possible to give you more time to ring the others. The second bell is right beside the chest, to the left. The third bell is on its own platform, just above the second bell. Ring the bells in this exact order, remembering the stand as close to the chest as you can when throwing your axe at the Twilight Stone to hit the first bell, and you’ll have enough time to ring them all and unlock the chest.\nAlfheim The Below Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök You’ll find The Below Nornir Chest behind the gate at the back of the cave with lots of purple Twilight Stone adorning the walls. You can’t actually get at it until you progress with the ‘Secret of the Sands’ Favour, however, so climb up the wall in the cave and follow the path past the rope zipline to get to it. This is a bell ringing rune puzzle, so you need to hit all three bells with your axe very quickly in order to unlock the chest. The first bell is a few floors above the actual chest, so follow the blue jumping points on the cliffs above to find a way up to its location, open the door on the right when you find it, then ring this bell first. Run down and ring the second bell, opposite the chest. Run into the door that leads back into the cave with all the Twilight Stone on its walls to find and hit the third bell found on the left, as soon as you go through the door. If rung quickly enough in this order, the Nornir chest will now be unlocked.\nAlfheim The Barrens Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök You’ll find The Barrens Nornir Chest in the northwestern area of the desert, by the structure with the hive matter and red nodes covering it. For this puzzle, you need to light three torches with your Blades of Chaos above where the runes are displayed. Before lighting any of the torches, you should clear the hive material away by throwing your axe through all of the red nodes at once. The first torch is found to the left of the small wall you can climb. The second torch is on the other side of the structure from the first torch, and you can access it by standing as close to it as possible by the rocks. The third torch is located on the roof of the structure, and to light it you’ll have to use your Axe to blow up the red jug beside it.\nAlfheim The Forbidden Sands Nornir Chest puzzle solution 1 and location in God of War Ragnarök The first Forbidden Sands Nornir Chest is located in the southwestern area of the desert, behind a fallen pillar. You need to have got the tool from a companion in Vanaheim to gain access to The Forbidden Sands first, however. This is a torch lighting rune puzzle, in which you need to light all three torches with your Chaos Blades, with a little help from Sigil Arrows. The first torch is in the area with the chest itself, right at the entrance. Use your Chaos Blades to light it. The second torch is outside of the area with the chest, on the left at the top of a rock formation. Use Sigil Arrows to create a line up to it and then use Kratos’ blades to light it. Do the same Sigil Arrow trick to light the third torch, which is opposite the second, tucked into the side of a very large rock formation.\nAlfheim The Forbidden Sands Nornir Chest puzzle solution 2 and location in God of War Ragnarök This Forbidden Sands Nornir Chest in Alfheim is one of the hardest to find in God of War Ragnarök, as you need to destroy the rubble under the outside entrance to the elven library first to unearth a crawlspace and locate it. Once inside, you’ll have to solve a complicated torch lighting puzzle, involving Sigil Arrows, Sonic Arrows, and Kratos’ Blades of Chaos. To clear the way, hit the purple Twilight Stone with your axe first to get rid of the red nodes. The first torch is down the gap to the left of the chest. To light it, you have to make a line with Sigil Arrows from the torch to the campfire behind it, then fire a Sigil Arrow at the campfire to create a chaining explosion and light the torch. The second torch is down the gap to the right of the chest. Use the same method to light this, creating a line of Sigil Arrows from the torch to the campfire, then firing at the campfire to create a chaining explosion. The third torch is located behind the hive material above the second torch. To reveal it, you have to use a Sonic Arrow. The hive matter won’t stay open, however, so to light this third torch, you need to open it with a Sonic Arrow, place a purple bubble under the torch with Sigil Arrows, then make a line towards the second torch. Quickly use a Sonic Arrow on the hive matter again and fire a Sigil Arrow at the second torch to cause a chaining explosion - remember to make the bubbles bigger by firing more Sigil Arrows in the middle of them. The last Nornir Chest in Alfheim is inaccessible until you get another weapon by progressing with the story. Don’t read any further if you don’t want to be spoiled for what this weapon is! There might also be some story spoilers in the pictures we use.\nAlfheim The Strond Nornir Chest puzzle solution 2 and location in God of War Ragnarök Now that you have the spear, you can go back to The Strond and use it to solve the Nornir Chest puzzle located just before the Temple of Light. To open the chest, you need to find and embed a spear on each rune, then detonate them all at the same time to stop them from coming back. Use your spear on the glowing yellow rock to the left of the chest to reveal the first rune and a Mystic Gateway. The second rune is just to the right of the chest, near the burning torch. The third rune is opposite the chest, past the large tree and elf corpses.\nGod of War Ragnarök Vanaheim Nornir chest locations explained There are 11 Nornir Chests in Vanaheim, with five accessible the first time you visit the Vanir Realm, and the other six opening up when you complete the next part of the story in Vanheim. Five of these require you to complete the ‘Scent of Survival’ Favour to unlock The Crater area, however. Here’s where to find all Nornir Chests in Vanaheim:\nVanaheim The Southern Wilds Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök The Southern Wilds Nornir Chest is located just south of Freyrs Camp, right before the river. This is a spinner puzzle, which means you need to find all three spinners and hit their golden paddles until the symbols match those on the chest. The first spinner is up and to the left of the chest, on a small cliff. Hit the panels until the ‘C’ rune is displayed. The second spinner is up and to the right of the chest, on a small cliff, but it’s covered in bramble so you have to clear it with your Blades of Chaos first. Hit the panels until the ’n’ rune is displayed. The third spinner is opposite the chest, on the other side of the area on a cliff. It’s also covered in bramble, so follow where the bramble trail starts and then light it from the left side. When it’s gone, hit the paddles until the ‘R’ symbol is displayed.\nVanaheim The Abandoned Village Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök The Abandoned Village Nornir Chest is located in the northwestern part of the area, accessible by climbing the northern cliffs of the village This is a torch lighting rune puzzle, which usually means you need to light all three torches with your Chaos Blades to unlock the chest, but this time you’ll have to swing a flame to each torch to light it. The first torch is under the path of the start of the puzzle. To light it, get rid of the bramble on the crane first, then hit the paddle to send the flame in the bucket to the right, then use your Chaos Blades to swing that flame towards you. For the second torch, hit the paddle until you can swing to the left platform, then go over to it and hit the paddles to send the flame in front of you, facing the bridge. Use your Chaos Blades to swing the flame to the left and light the torch. For the third flame, go back to the start of the puzzle and hit the paddles until you can swing across to the bridge, then go down the right-hand path to find the Abandoned Village Nornir Chest and the third torch opposite it. Use your blades to light it.\nVanaheim Cliffside Ruins Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök The Cliffside Ruins Nornir Chest is on an island directly across from the shop and Mystic Gate.\nThis is a spinner puzzle, which means you need to find all three spinners and hit their golden paddles until the symbols match those on the chest. For the first spinner, you’ll have to go to the small area with the shop and Mystic Gate across the way. Look over at the Cliffside Ruins and you’ll see the spinner near the water. Hit the paddles until the ‘P’ rune is displayed. The second spinner is below the golden chain by the cliff, but you’ll have to climb up onto the columns in the middle of the area to be able to look down and see it. When you do have sight of it, hit the panels until the wonky ‘F’ rune is displayed. The third spinner is to the right of the Nornir Chest, on top of a small incline, but you’ll have to use Sigil Arrows to make a path towards it first and then use Kratos’ Chaos Blades to burn the bramble off it. When you’ve done this, spin the paddles until the ‘R’ rune is displayed.\nVanaheim The Veiled Passage Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök The Veiled Passage is found by taking a left on the river before heading to Goddess Falls. Dock the boat then head up the path to find the chest. This is a bell ringing rune puzzle, which means you need to ring all three bells very quickly in order to unlock the chest. You’ll also need the help of Sigil Arrows and Fire Bombs to solve this one. All three bells are located behind the runic chest on the stone wall, and need to be rung at the same time to open it. To do this you need to clear the red bramble on the right by firing a Sigil Arrow and then throwing a Fire Bomb at it. All you have to do now is line up three Sigil Arrow bubbles between the bells, then throw a Fire Bomb at the middle - this triggers all of the purple bubbles to explode, ringing all the bells and unlocking the Veiled Passage Nornir chest.\nVanaheim Goddess Falls Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök The Goddess Falls Nornir Chest is at the top of the cliff overlooking the triple waterfall that leads to the Vanir Shrine area. This is a torch lighting rune puzzle in which you need to light all three torches with your Chaos Blades to unlock the chest, with a little help from Sigil Arrows this time round. The first torch is located to the right of the chest, on a small cliff above two lone, moss-covered rocks. You need to use these rocks to make a line of Sigil Arrow bubbles towards the torch, then use your Chaos Blades on the closest one to light it. The second torch is on the opposite cliffside to the first, to the left of the chest. Use the same method and create a line of Sigil Arrow bubbles to the torch and light the one nearest you with the Chaos Blades. The third torch is in the waterfall to the left of the chest, and you’ll need to create a line with Sigil Arrows up to it as well. This is the hardest one to get accurate, but keep in mind that you can make the Sigil Arrow bubbles larger by hitting the exact same spot again. You can do this two times, but they run on a timer, so be quick! The rest of the Nornir Chests in Vanaheim aren’t accessible until you return to the Realm again as part of the story. You’ll also have to complete the ‘Scent of Survival’ Favour to unlock The Crater area, which contains four Nornir chests. Don’t read on if you haven’t got to this part in the story yet, as the descriptions and pictures will contain spoilers!\nVanaheim Eastern Barri Woods Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök The Eastern Barri Woods chest is found up the spiral stairs located in the area. This is a spinner puzzle, which means you need to find all three spinners and hit their golden paddles until the symbols match those on the chest. The first spinner is just above and to the right of the Nornir Chest. Hit the golden paddles until the wonky ‘F’ rune is displayed. The second spinner is to the left of the entrance to the Nornir Chest, at the top of the spiral steps. You’ll need to make a line of Sigil Arrows up to the bramble and then use Kratos’ blades first to burn it off before you can hit it to display the ‘P’ rune. The third spinner is found inside the small building across the way from the Nornir Chests. Follow the short path to the left of the chest then look across to see it and hit the paddles until the ‘C’ rune is displayed.\nVanaheim The Plains Nornir Chest puzzle solution 1 and location in God of War Ragnarök The first Plains Nornir Chest in the Crater of Vanaheim is located in the northern part of the middle Plains area. To solve this puzzle, you have to take the path on the left before the entrance to The Sinkholes and kill the enemies near the shop - then burn the bramble off the bell on the right-hand side of this area. Once you’ve done that, head back to the chest and ring the bell to the right of the chest first, then ring the bell to the left. Run and ring the third and last bell to the left and up from the chest, on top of the rocks. This is the bell you burned the bramble from above.\nVanaheim The Plains Nornir Chest puzzle solution 2 and location in God of War Ragnarök This Nornir Chest is located near the Vali The Oath Guard sub-boss in the northwest of The Plains, but to open the gate that leads to it, you have to go up and to the right to throw your axe at the cocoon spewing poison to freeze it and clear the path through. Go back to the gate and open it to find the area with the chest. You’ll have to throw your axe at more poison cocoons to defeat the enemies in here and get access to the runes. The first rune is inside the tree to the left of the entrance. The second rune is up and to the left of the chest, on a rock. To get to the last rune, use your axe to freeze the poison cocoon at the back of the area, then hug the left and turn around to see the rune behind the tree. Make sure you’ve stepped out of the poison’s ring, then recall your axe and hit the rune. Hit the cocoon again to make your way back to the Nornir Chest.\nVanaheim The Sinkholes Nornir Chest puzzle solution 1 and location in God of War Ragnarök The first Nornir Chest in the Sinkholes area of Vanheim is located right at the entrance to the Sinkholes, below the rope zipline. This is a torch lighting rune puzzle in which you need to light all three torches with your Chaos Blades to unlock the chest. Sigil Arrows are needed too. The first torch is up and to the right of the chest, above the green pond. You need to make a line with Sigil Arrow and then use the Blades on the closest one to light the torch. The second torch is above the chest on the side of the cliff. Jump and climb back up the entrance to the Sinkholes to spot it. You’ll have to make another line of Sigil Arrows to the torch in order to light it. The third torch is in the room to the left of the chest. You can’t get in this room yet, but that’s okay, as you can use your Sigil Arrows to make a line to the torch and light it with Kratos’ Blades of Chaos.\nVanaheim The Jungle Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök You can only get to this Jungle Nornir Chest in Vanaheim by completing the ‘Return of the River’ Favour, picked up in The Jungle area of The Crater. This brings rivers back to the area, letting you take a boat to the chest in the south, near the Mystic Gate. This is a spinner puzzle, which means you need to find all three spinners and hit their golden paddles until the symbols match those on the chest. The first spinner is just up and to the right of the chest, by a crumbling wall. Hit the paddles until the ‘E’ rune is displayed. The second spinner is located on the top of the narrow building opposite the chest. Climb the wall to the left of the chest to be able to reach its paddles, then hit them until the ‘B’ rune is displayed. The third spinner is hidden under some red bramble, opposite the narrow building the second spinner is on top of. Burn off the bramble with Sigil Arrows and Kratos’ Blades, then hit the paddles until the small ’n’ rune is displayed.\nVanaheim The Sinkholes Nornir Chest puzzle solution 2 and location in God of War Ragnarök You can’t get this Nornir Chest until you complete the ‘Return of the River’ Favour, picked up in The Jungle area of The Crater in Vanaheim. This brings rivers back to the area, letting you take a boat to the northern area as part of the ‘Burning Skies’ Favour. Follow the dragon through the building and use your spear to destroy walls to block it from breathing fire at you, then leave the building to find the Nornir Chest overlooking the water. You’ll need to use your spear to hit all three runes when you find then, then detonate to destroy them all at the same time. The first rune is on your left as soon as you drop down from climbing to this area, on the cliff near the tree roots. The second rune is on top of the pillar just to the left of the golden chain that takes you back to the boat. The last rune is up and to the left of the chest, on a ledge by the broken pillar. Ragnarök is finally here and we’ve got pages on Nornir Chest locations and solutions, Raven locations and rewards, Muspelheim Seed locations, and Thor and Alva boss fight strategies to help you on your journey through the nine Realms. If you want to know how long Kratos’ epic adventure will take, we’ve also got a page on how long to beat and Platinum Trophy length.\nGod of War Ragnarök Midgard Nornir chest locations explained There are four Nornir Chests to find in the Midgard Realm, with all four available from the first time Kratos visits as part of the story. Here’s every Midgard Nornir Chest location and how to solve each puzzle:\nMidgard Well of Urd Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök The Well of Urd Nornir Chest is located near the cliff at the end of the path found north of the shop and Mystic Gateway in the northern area of Midgard. This is a torch lighting rune puzzle in which you need to light all three torches with your Chaos Blades to unlock the chest. Sigil Arrows can help too. The first torch is opposite the chest, to the left of the climbing spot in the mountain. You only need your blades for this, as it’s close enough. Use that climbing spot to start making your way up the mountain and you’ll see the second torch. Climb up until you can’t go any further and look down to see the torch again on the left. You might be able to jump down from here and just light it with Kratos’ blades, but we used Sigil Arrows to make a line to light it, making the purple bubbles bigger by firing more Sigil arrows in the middle of them. We used Sigil arrows so we didn’t have to jump down, as the third torch is just up and to the right of this spot at the top.\nMidgard The Oarsman Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök The Oarsman Nornir Chest is located inside the building near the statue itself, by the Mystic Gateway. This is a bell ringing rune puzzle, which means you need to ring all three bells very quickly in order to unlock the chest. To gain access to all three bells, however, you need to open a path. Climb up the wall to the left of the locked gate to start. Keep following this path and you’ll eventually meet a Huntress sub-boss. Deal with her by aiming for her horns to stagger her. Once she’s killed, climb the golden chain, then interact with the large silver chain at the top to reveal a door back into the building. Opening the door at the end of this corridor will bring you back to the room with the Nornir Chest. Clear the Sonic debris beside this door to clear a path to one of the bells. Then, go back into the room with the chest and hit the bell inside the crack in the wall first. Run and hit the bell by the door you just opened next. Turn around and hit the bell across the cavern last.\nMidgard The Lost Treasury Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök This Nornir Chest is outside the Lost Treasury door, and to unlock it you’ll have to clear a path to the inside, which you’ll come to naturally as part of the ‘Sigrun’s Curse’ Favour. The first step is to move the giant shield blocking the door all the way to the right and use it to climb up to the top of the treasury building. Then, clear the debris by throwing your axe. Go through the door, and after you’ve dealt with the enemies, look up and to the right of where you entered to see the first torch. Use your Sigil Arrows to make a path and light it with your blades. Go back down to where the Nornir Chest is and move the shield to the left, you’ll have uncovered the second torch, which you also need to make a line of Sigil Arrows to and light that way. To get to the third torch, you have to find a way into the treasury, so make sure the shield is on the left and climb it to the top and move that column you unearthed by blowing up the debris previously to the left, blocking the shield’s path. Go to the wheel in front of the gate and turn it all the way down, then fire a Sigil Arrow at both gears, throw your axe at one, recall it, and then throw it at the other gear. Quickly run into the treasury before the ice melts. When inside, destroy the silver seal to open the treasury door and let your companion in, then use their Sigil Arrows to make a line to the third and final torch, to the right of the Legendary Chest.\nMidgard Raider Hideout Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök This Nornir Chest is located inside the Raider Hideout found under the path leading to the King’s Grave and Mystic Gateway. Once the raiders are dealt with, pick up a Fire Bomb and throw it at the debris between the red tapestries to light the torch behind it. The second torch is to the left of the first, tucked in the corner, and you’ll need to use your Sigil Arrows and blade to clear the red bramble first, then use the Sigil Arrows again to make a line to the torch. Light the line with the Blades of Chaos to reach the torch. The third torch is near the entrance, at the end of the large cavern to the right. You’ll need to make a horizontal line with Sigil Arrows to the torch, then throw a fire bomb at the purple bubbles to light it.\nGod of War Ragnarök Muspelheim Nornir chest locations explained There are two Nornir Chests to find in Muspelheim, and to locate them all, you’ll have to complete ‘The Summoning’ Path main quest and find the two Muspelheim seeds to unlock The Crucible Trials area.\nMuspelheim Nornir Chest puzzle solution 1 and location in God of War Ragnarök The Nornir Chest in Muspelheim is behind a glowing yellow crack in the wall which you need to blow up with your spear. This is a torch lighting rune puzzle in which you need to light all three torches with your Chaos Blades to unlock the chest, with a little help from Sigil Arrows. The first torch is up and to the right of the chest. Use Sigil arrows to make a line up to it and then light with Kratos’ Blades. The second and third torches are across the way to the left of the chest, but you have to leave the chest area and take a right to make a line with Runic Arrows from it to Kratos to be able to light it. To light the third torch, go back to the chest area and make a line from the unlit torch to the lit one. Hitting the lit torch with a Runic Arrow will then cause an explosion that will flow through the purple bubbles and light the third torch.\nMuspelheim Nornir Chest puzzle solution 2 and location in God of War Ragnarök The second Nornir Chest in Muspelheim can only be opened by taking part in Crucible challenges marked by a sword with a rune. You need to complete both challenges associated with each sword. To get to this area, you’ll have to find both Muspelheim Seeds first. The first sword rune trial is up one floor and to the left of the actual chest. The second sword rune trial is up two floors and to the right of the chest. Use your blades to jump up to the second level, then turn left. The third sword rune trial is found by taking a right instead of a left after using your blades to jump up to the second level of the area. So just down from the second one.\nNiflheim Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök The only Nornir Chest in Niflheim is found two floors up from the bottom of the Aesir Prison. You’ll have to destroy walls and use your spear to make your way up to the actual chest. All you have to do to open this chest is to destroy regular runes. The first rune is opposite the chest itself. The second rune is one floor down, behind a gate containing one one of the prisoners. The third rune is on the bottom floor, on the patch of ice in the middle. All the best hunting for Nornir Chests in God of War Ragnarök!\n","wordCount":"7350","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-19T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-19T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jonathon

class=post-content><hr><p>All Nornir Chests have a different type of puzzle involving three rune symbols that you must solve in order to unlock it and claim its reward.
These can be difficult to work out a lot of the time, so we’ve got all Nornir Chest puzzle solutions in God of War Ragnarok detailed below, including Nornir Chest locations for Svartalfheim, Alfheim, Vanaheim, Midgard, Muspelheim, and Niflheim.
For more Ragnarök help, check out our Raven locations, and Muspelheim Seed locations pages.</p><h2 id=god-of-war-ragnarök-nornir-chests-and-rewards-explained>God of War Ragnarök Nornir Chests and rewards explained<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#god-of-war-ragnarök-nornir-chests-and-rewards-explained>#</a></h2><p>There are 35 Nornir Chests in God of War Ragnarök, with 30 containing either an Apple of Idunn or a Horn of the Blood Mead. Finding apples will increase Kratos’ maximum health, and finding horns increases Kratos’ maximum Rage. Each upgrade costs more each time, however, costing five apples or horns to improve health and Rage by the end of the game.
Svartalfheim:
Alfheim:
Vanaheim - Jungle:
Vanaheim - Crater:
Midgard:
Muspelheim:
Niflheim:
These rewards alternate every chest you open. So you’ll get an Idunn Apple the first time you open any Nornir Chest, then a Horn of the Blood Mead for the next one, then an apple, and so on until you open 30 Nornir Chests.
When you open the remaining five chests, you’ll get other rewards, such as Hacksilver, Shattered Rune materials, and weapon Enchantments. However, if you only want to get the &lsquo;Full Belly&rsquo; Trophy, then you just need to find the 30 Runic Chests containing the apples and horns.
Every Nornir Chest can only be opened once the three runes surrounding it have been destroyed, lit on fire, spun, or had their bell rung. Finding the runes is sometimes the hardest part, but it’s usually working out how to destroy, light, or ring the runes that makes the puzzles so difficult.
It’s important to remember that you won’t be able to unlock every Nornir Chest you find the first time you visit a Realm, as you’ll need to get special equipment or abilities that let you solve the puzzles first. These are all obtained during the story, so don’t worry about not being able to open them straight away.
We recommend solving the puzzles you can when you come across them, but waiting until after - or close to - the end of the game to go hunting for all the Nornir Chests in Ragnarök.</p><h2 id=god-of-war-ragnarök-svartalfheim-nornir-chest-locations-explained>God of War Ragnarök Svartalfheim Nornir chest locations explained<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#god-of-war-ragnarök-svartalfheim-nornir-chest-locations-explained>#</a></h2><p>There are 10 Nornir Chests in Svartalfheim, with five accessible the first time you visit the dwarven Realm.
Here’s where to find all ten Nornir Chests in Svartalfheim:</p><h2 id=svartalfheim-aurvangar-wetlands-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-1-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Svartalfheim Aurvangar Wetlands Nornir Chest puzzle solution 1 and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#svartalfheim-aurvangar-wetlands-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-1-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>The first Nornir Chest in Svartalfheim is located in the Aurvangar Wetlands, in the area with the geysers you need to freeze in order to cross and find a way to turn the large wooden wheel in the water to get past it in the boat.
Go right when you freeze the first geyser after docking the boat to locate the Nornir Chest. To open it, you need to destroy the three runes by throwing your axe at them.
The first rune you need to destroy is directly to the right of the chest.
The second rune is on an inaccessible island behind and to the left of the chest. Throw your axe to reach it.
To get to the third rune, go back and freeze the geyser under the platform above the chest.
You can now jump up and destroy the last rune, which is located under a tree.</p><h2 id=svartalfheim-aurvangar-wetlands-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-2-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Svartalfheim Aurvangar Wetlands Nornir Chest puzzle solution 2 and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#svartalfheim-aurvangar-wetlands-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-2-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>The second Runic Chest in the Aurvangar Wetlands of Svartalfheim is located on the island you find by going under the small wooden bridge in the boat near the Legendary Chest on a ledge, accessed before solving the puzzle to open the door into the next area.
Go right once you dock the boat to find the chest. To open it, you need to spin the golden circles above the three runes by hitting them with your axe until the correct one is displayed.
The first spinner is located to the right of the Nornir Chest, but you’ll need to freeze the geyser by throwing your axe at it first to see what symbol is currently displayed. For this spinner, we want the ‘P’ symbol to display. Hit the paddles with the axe, then freeze the geyser to make sure it’s the ‘P’ rune, then move on.
The second spinner is found around the corner from the first spinner, above the drop. Throw your axe at one of the paddles until the ‘B’ rune is displayed.
The third spinner is located near the Legendary Chest in the upper left-hand corner of this area. Go up the wall on the left and turn around to see the spinner, then hit the paddles until the ‘N’ rune appears.</p><h2 id=svartalfheim-dragon-beach-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Svartalfheim Dragon Beach Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#svartalfheim-dragon-beach-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>You’ll find the Dragon Beach Nornir Chest at the back of the area, under a geyser. For this puzzle, you need to find the three runes and destroy them with your axe.
The first rune is behind the geyser by the Nornir Chest. You’ll have to freeze the geyser with your axe first to see exactly where to throw it through the water to destroy it.
The second rune is behind the gate near a crane you can use Sonic Arrows to damage. You’ll have to go around the rocks on its right to hit from behind, though.
The third rune is behind another geyser, located beside the other crane you can damage with Sonic Arrows, near the coast. Freeze the geyser to see exactly where it is, then recall and hit the rune behind the water.</p><h2 id=svartalfheim-radsvinns-rig-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Svartalfheim Radsvinn’s Rig Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#svartalfheim-radsvinns-rig-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>You’ll find the Radsvinn&rsquo;s Rig Nornir Chest on top of the rig itself, where the forge you have to destroy for the &lsquo;In Service of Asgard&rsquo; Favour is. For this puzzle, you need to light three torches with your Blades of Chaos above where the runes are displayed.
The first torch is just beside the chest, to the left. Aim with your Chaos Blades and use a heavy attack when close enough to light it.
The second torch is located behind a metal fence to the right of the furnace in the middle. You’ll have to go up a level on the rig and hit the red jar with your axe to destroy it and light the torch in the resulting explosion.
The third torch is found behind the furnace, but you’ll have to use Sonic Arrows to destroy the barrels in front of it before you can light it.</p><h2 id=svartalfheim-alberich-island-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Svartalfheim Alberich Island Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#svartalfheim-alberich-island-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>You’ll find the Alberich Island Nornir Chest on your right as soon as you dock on the island.
This is a bell ringing rune puzzle, which means you need to hit all three bells with your axe very quickly in order to unlock the chest.
The first bell is behind a gate to the left of the chest, and this should be the first one you ring, as to access it you have to hit the wooden board to its left twice and then quickly throw your axe at the bell before it drops again.
The second bell is found opposite the chest, but you’ll have to use Sonic Arrows on the crane glowing green that holds the bell in order to lower it.
The third bell is located just above the chest.
Ring the bells in this exact order and you’ll be able to hit them all before you run out of time.
The rest of the Nornir Chests in Svartalfheim aren&rsquo;t accessible until you get another weapon at The Forge when you return to Svartalfheim.

The first torch is opposite the chest, so just use your blades to light it.
The second torch is to the left of the chest, but it&rsquo;s too far to reach with just Kratos&rsquo; blades. Use Sigil Arrows to make a path towards the torch, then light the bubbles with the Chaos Blades. Remember that you can make the purple bubbles bigger by firing another Sigil Arrow in the middle of one.
The last torch is in the corridor opposite the chest, hidden behind some barrels. Destroy the barrels, then light the torch with the Chaos Blades.</p><h2 id=svartalfheim-applecore-mines-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-1-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Svartalfheim Applecore Mines Nornir Chest puzzle solution 1 and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#svartalfheim-applecore-mines-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-1-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>The first Nornir Chest in the Applecore Mines is near the start, down the rope zipline you can create when you have the spear. You&rsquo;ll also need to use the spear on the wall near the end of this zipline to climb up and access the chest.
To solve this Nornir Chest puzzle, you need to throw a spear at each rune, then detonate them at the same time.
The first and second runes are on elevated wooden platforms to the left of the chest.
The third rune is also to the left of the chest, but is on top of rocks instead, not on a platform.</p><h2 id=svartalfheim-applecore-mines-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-2-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Svartalfheim Applecore Mines Nornir Chest puzzle solution 2 and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#svartalfheim-applecore-mines-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-2-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>To get to the second Applecore Mines Nornir Chest, you need to go back to the room where you solved the water wheel puzzle by separating with Atreus in the story, all the way back in the beginning of the game. Go through the crawlspace on the right of this room and use your new spear on the wind spot on the room beyond to climb up and unlock a new Mystic Gateway. The Nornir Chest is right beside this gate.
For this puzzle, you need to locate all three runes, throw a spear at each, then detonate them at the same time to destroy the runes.
The first rune is directly opposite the Mystic Gateway.
The second rune is around the corner, beside the Yggdrasil tear. Blow up the red jar to clear the debris and reveal it.
The third rune is tricky to find, as you can&rsquo;t actually see it. Go to the end of the platform, opposite the Yggdrasil tear, and look down at the water flowing to the right of the stationary cog. Your reticle will change when you&rsquo;re aiming at where the rune is. Fire here, these detonate to blow up all three runes.</p><h2 id=svartalfheim-jarnsmida-pitmines-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Svartalfheim Jarnsmida Pitmines Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#svartalfheim-jarnsmida-pitmines-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>Remember this one from early in the story?

Go through the gate beside the Mystic Gateway you found beside the last Applecore Nornir Chest to get back to the Jarnsmida Pitmines area, then use your spear to make your way back to this chest.
This is a torch lighting rune puzzle, which means you need to light all three torches with your Chaos Blades to unlock the chest - but you&rsquo;ll need Sigil Arrows to reach the torches.
You&rsquo;ve probably already lit the first torch, which is just beside and to the left of the chest.
The second torch is opposite the chest and down the gap, to the left. To light it, you need to make a line of Sigil Arrows from the torch to Kratos and then light the nearest purple bubble with his Blades. Remember that you can make the bubbles bigger by firing more Sigil Arrows into the middle of a bubble.
The last torch is down the jump to the left of the chest. Use your axe on the wooden trough above to stop the water falling on the torch, then light it with the Blades of Chaos.</p><h2 id=svartalfheim-the-forge-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Svartalfheim The Forge Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#svartalfheim-the-forge-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>You can&rsquo;t solve this Nornir Chest puzzle until you return to Svartalfheim as part of the story and get the spear. It&rsquo;s in a nook just up from the entrance to the Myrkr Tunnels.
To open this chest, you need to throw spears at the three runes, then detonate them at the same time to keep them from coming back.
The first rune is located on the cliff to the left of the chest.
The second rune is directly opposite the chest, on a small dent on the cliff.
The third rune is on the path towards the mining carts, behind the rocks in the middle.</p><h2 id=god-of-war-ragnarök-alfheim-nornir-chest-locations-explained>God of War Ragnarök Alfheim Nornir chest locations explained<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#god-of-war-ragnarök-alfheim-nornir-chest-locations-explained>#</a></h2><p>There are seven Nornir Chests in Alfheim, with four accessible the first time you visit the Elven Realm, two more available when you gain access to The Forbidden Sands with a new tool, and then the last one is only accessible by getting a new weapon as part of the story.
Here’s where to find all Nornir Chests in Alfheim:</p><h2 id=alfheim-the-strond-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Alfheim The Strond Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#alfheim-the-strond-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>You&rsquo;ll find The Strond Nornir Chest down a drop after crawling through a wallspace, just ahead of the Mystic Gateway.
This is a torch lighting rune puzzle, which means you need to light all three torches with your Chaos Blades to unlock the chest.
The first torch is to the left of the Nornir Chest, on the cliff’s edge behind some rocks.
The second torch is located at the back of this chest area, under the path on the left, near the cliff edge.
The third torch is found in the same area as the second, but above the path. Climb up the wall on the right to reach it and light it, or light it from the higher path accessible on the main path towards the Temple of Light.
The next Nornir Chest on The Strond is inaccessible until you get a specific tool later in the game, so ignore it for now.</p><h2 id=alfheim-temple-of-light-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Alfheim Temple of Light Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#alfheim-temple-of-light-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>You’ll find the Temple of Light Nornir Chest in the room accessible by the wide light bridge Tyr helped Kratos and Atreus cross during the story inside the temple. This is past the white marble Legendary Chest puzzle, and the fights involving mobs of Light Elves and purple mirrors.
This is a bell ringing rune puzzle, which means you need to hit all three bells with your axe very quickly in order to unlock the chest.
The first bell is down the path behind the Nornir Chest, but to access it you’ll need to use Sonic Arrows to destroy the grate blocking it. When throwing the axe at the purple Twilight Stone to ring the bell, stand as far back towards the chest as possible to give you more time to ring the others.
The second bell is right beside the chest, to the left.
The third bell is on its own platform, just above the second bell.
Ring the bells in this exact order, remembering the stand as close to the chest as you can when throwing your axe at the Twilight Stone to hit the first bell, and you’ll have enough time to ring them all and unlock the chest.</p><h2 id=alfheim-the-below-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Alfheim The Below Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#alfheim-the-below-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>You’ll find The Below Nornir Chest behind the gate at the back of the cave with lots of purple Twilight Stone adorning the walls. You can’t actually get at it until you progress with the &lsquo;Secret of the Sands&rsquo; Favour, however, so climb up the wall in the cave and follow the path past the rope zipline to get to it.
This is a bell ringing rune puzzle, so you need to hit all three bells with your axe very quickly in order to unlock the chest.
The first bell is a few floors above the actual chest, so follow the blue jumping points on the cliffs above to find a way up to its location, open the door on the right when you find it, then ring this bell first.
Run down and ring the second bell, opposite the chest.
Run into the door that leads back into the cave with all the Twilight Stone on its walls to find and hit the third bell found on the left, as soon as you go through the door.
If rung quickly enough in this order, the Nornir chest will now be unlocked.</p><h2 id=alfheim-the-barrens-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Alfheim The Barrens Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#alfheim-the-barrens-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>You’ll find The Barrens Nornir Chest in the northwestern area of the desert, by the structure with the hive matter and red nodes covering it. For this puzzle, you need to light three torches with your Blades of Chaos above where the runes are displayed.
Before lighting any of the torches, you should clear the hive material away by throwing your axe through all of the red nodes at once.
The first torch is found to the left of the small wall you can climb.
The second torch is on the other side of the structure from the first torch, and you can access it by standing as close to it as possible by the rocks.
The third torch is located on the roof of the structure, and to light it you’ll have to use your Axe to blow up the red jug beside it.</p><h2 id=alfheim-the-forbidden-sands-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-1-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Alfheim The Forbidden Sands Nornir Chest puzzle solution 1 and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#alfheim-the-forbidden-sands-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-1-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>The first Forbidden Sands Nornir Chest is located in the southwestern area of the desert, behind a fallen pillar. You need to have got the tool from a companion in Vanaheim to gain access to The Forbidden Sands first, however.
This is a torch lighting rune puzzle, in which you need to light all three torches with your Chaos Blades, with a little help from Sigil Arrows.
The first torch is in the area with the chest itself, right at the entrance. Use your Chaos Blades to light it.
The second torch is outside of the area with the chest, on the left at the top of a rock formation. Use Sigil Arrows to create a line up to it and then use Kratos&rsquo; blades to light it.
Do the same Sigil Arrow trick to light the third torch, which is opposite the second, tucked into the side of a very large rock formation.</p><h2 id=alfheim-the-forbidden-sands-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-2-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Alfheim The Forbidden Sands Nornir Chest puzzle solution 2 and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#alfheim-the-forbidden-sands-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-2-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>This Forbidden Sands Nornir Chest in Alfheim is one of the hardest to find in God of War Ragnarök, as you need to destroy the rubble under the outside entrance to the elven library first to unearth a crawlspace and locate it.
Once inside, you&rsquo;ll have to solve a complicated torch lighting puzzle, involving Sigil Arrows, Sonic Arrows, and Kratos&rsquo; Blades of Chaos. To clear the way, hit the purple Twilight Stone with your axe first to get rid of the red nodes.
The first torch is down the gap to the left of the chest. To light it, you have to make a line with Sigil Arrows from the torch to the campfire behind it, then fire a Sigil Arrow at the campfire to create a chaining explosion and light the torch.
The second torch is down the gap to the right of the chest. Use the same method to light this, creating a line of Sigil Arrows from the torch to the campfire, then firing at the campfire to create a chaining explosion.
The third torch is located behind the hive material above the second torch. To reveal it, you have to use a Sonic Arrow.
The hive matter won&rsquo;t stay open, however, so to light this third torch, you need to open it with a Sonic Arrow, place a purple bubble under the torch with Sigil Arrows, then make a line towards the second torch. Quickly use a Sonic Arrow on the hive matter again and fire a Sigil Arrow at the second torch to cause a chaining explosion - remember to make the bubbles bigger by firing more Sigil Arrows in the middle of them.
The last Nornir Chest in Alfheim is inaccessible until you get another weapon by progressing with the story.

This is a torch lighting rune puzzle, which usually means you need to light all three torches with your Chaos Blades to unlock the chest, but this time you&rsquo;ll have to swing a flame to each torch to light it.
The first torch is under the path of the start of the puzzle. To light it, get rid of the bramble on the crane first, then hit the paddle to send the flame in the bucket to the right, then use your Chaos Blades to swing that flame towards you.
For the second torch, hit the paddle until you can swing to the left platform, then go over to it and hit the paddles to send the flame in front of you, facing the bridge. Use your Chaos Blades to swing the flame to the left and light the torch.

This is a torch lighting rune puzzle in which you need to light all three torches with your Chaos Blades to unlock the chest, with a little help from Sigil Arrows this time round.
The first torch is located to the right of the chest, on a small cliff above two lone, moss-covered rocks. You need to use these rocks to make a line of Sigil Arrow bubbles towards the torch, then use your Chaos Blades on the closest one to light it.
The second torch is on the opposite cliffside to the first, to the left of the chest. Use the same method and create a line of Sigil Arrow bubbles to the torch and light the one nearest you with the Chaos Blades.
The third torch is in the waterfall to the left of the chest, and you&rsquo;ll need to create a line with Sigil Arrows up to it as well. This is the hardest one to get accurate, but keep in mind that you can make the Sigil Arrow bubbles larger by hitting the exact same spot again. You can do this two times, but they run on a timer, so be quick!

The second spinner is to the left of the entrance to the Nornir Chest, at the top of the spiral steps. You&rsquo;ll need to make a line of Sigil Arrows up to the bramble and then use Kratos&rsquo; blades first to burn it off before you can hit it to display the &lsquo;P&rsquo; rune.
The third spinner is found inside the small building across the way from the Nornir Chests. Follow the short path to the left of the chest then look across to see it and hit the paddles until the &lsquo;C&rsquo; rune is displayed.</p><h2 id=vanaheim-the-plains-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-1-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Vanaheim The Plains Nornir Chest puzzle solution 1 and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#vanaheim-the-plains-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-1-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>The first Plains Nornir Chest in the Crater of Vanaheim is located in the northern part of the middle Plains area.
To solve this puzzle, you have to take the path on the left before the entrance to The Sinkholes and kill the enemies near the shop - then burn the bramble off the bell on the right-hand side of this area.
Once you&rsquo;ve done that, head back to the chest and ring the bell to the right of the chest first, then ring the bell to the left.
Run and ring the third and last bell to the left and up from the chest, on top of the rocks. This is the bell you burned the bramble from above.</p><h2 id=vanaheim-the-plains-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-2-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Vanaheim The Plains Nornir Chest puzzle solution 2 and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#vanaheim-the-plains-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-2-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>This Nornir Chest is located near the Vali The Oath Guard sub-boss in the northwest of The Plains, but to open the gate that leads to it, you have to go up and to the right to throw your axe at the cocoon spewing poison to freeze it and clear the path through.
Go back to the gate and open it to find the area with the chest. You&rsquo;ll have to throw your axe at more poison cocoons to defeat the enemies in here and get access to the runes.
The first rune is inside the tree to the left of the entrance.
The second rune is up and to the left of the chest, on a rock.
To get to the last rune, use your axe to freeze the poison cocoon at the back of the area, then hug the left and turn around to see the rune behind the tree. Make sure you&rsquo;ve stepped out of the poison&rsquo;s ring, then recall your axe and hit the rune. Hit the cocoon again to make your way back to the Nornir Chest.</p><h2 id=vanaheim-the-sinkholes-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-1-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Vanaheim The Sinkholes Nornir Chest puzzle solution 1 and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#vanaheim-the-sinkholes-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-1-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>The first Nornir Chest in the Sinkholes area of Vanheim is located right at the entrance to the Sinkholes, below the rope zipline.
This is a torch lighting rune puzzle in which you need to light all three torches with your Chaos Blades to unlock the chest. Sigil Arrows are needed too.
The first torch is up and to the right of the chest, above the green pond. You need to make a line with Sigil Arrow and then use the Blades on the closest one to light the torch.
The second torch is above the chest on the side of the cliff. Jump and climb back up the entrance to the Sinkholes to spot it. You&rsquo;ll have to make another line of Sigil Arrows to the torch in order to light it.
The third torch is in the room to the left of the chest. You can&rsquo;t get in this room yet, but that&rsquo;s okay, as you can use your Sigil Arrows to make a line to the torch and light it with Kratos&rsquo; Blades of Chaos.</p><h2 id=vanaheim-the-jungle-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Vanaheim The Jungle Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#vanaheim-the-jungle-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>You can only get to this Jungle Nornir Chest in Vanaheim by completing the &lsquo;Return of the River&rsquo; Favour, picked up in The Jungle area of The Crater. This brings rivers back to the area, letting you take a boat to the chest in the south, near the Mystic Gate.
This is a spinner puzzle, which means you need to find all three spinners and hit their golden paddles until the symbols match those on the chest.
The first spinner is just up and to the right of the chest, by a crumbling wall. Hit the paddles until the &lsquo;E&rsquo; rune is displayed.
The second spinner is located on the top of the narrow building opposite the chest. Climb the wall to the left of the chest to be able to reach its paddles, then hit them until the &lsquo;B&rsquo; rune is displayed.
The third spinner is hidden under some red bramble, opposite the narrow building the second spinner is on top of. Burn off the bramble with Sigil Arrows and Kratos&rsquo; Blades, then hit the paddles until the small &rsquo;n&rsquo; rune is displayed.</p><h2 id=vanaheim-the-sinkholes-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-2-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Vanaheim The Sinkholes Nornir Chest puzzle solution 2 and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#vanaheim-the-sinkholes-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-2-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>You can&rsquo;t get this Nornir Chest until you complete the &lsquo;Return of the River&rsquo; Favour, picked up in The Jungle area of The Crater in Vanaheim. This brings rivers back to the area, letting you take a boat to the northern area as part of the &lsquo;Burning Skies&rsquo; Favour.
Follow the dragon through the building and use your spear to destroy walls to block it from breathing fire at you, then leave the building to find the Nornir Chest overlooking the water.
You&rsquo;ll need to use your spear to hit all three runes when you find then, then detonate to destroy them all at the same time.
The first rune is on your left as soon as you drop down from climbing to this area, on the cliff near the tree roots.
The second rune is on top of the pillar just to the left of the golden chain that takes you back to the boat.
The last rune is up and to the left of the chest, on a ledge by the broken pillar.
Ragnarök is finally here and we&rsquo;ve got pages on Nornir Chest locations and solutions, Raven locations and rewards, Muspelheim Seed locations, and Thor and Alva boss fight strategies to help you on your journey through the nine Realms.

Here&rsquo;s every Midgard Nornir Chest location and how to solve each puzzle:</p><h2 id=midgard-well-of-urd-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Midgard Well of Urd Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#midgard-well-of-urd-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>The Well of Urd Nornir Chest is located near the cliff at the end of the path found north of the shop and Mystic Gateway in the northern area of Midgard.
This is a torch lighting rune puzzle in which you need to light all three torches with your Chaos Blades to unlock the chest. Sigil Arrows can help too.
The first torch is opposite the chest, to the left of the climbing spot in the mountain. You only need your blades for this, as it&rsquo;s close enough.
Use that climbing spot to start making your way up the mountain and you&rsquo;ll see the second torch. Climb up until you can&rsquo;t go any further and look down to see the torch again on the left. You might be able to jump down from here and just light it with Kratos&rsquo; blades, but we used Sigil Arrows to make a line to light it, making the purple bubbles bigger by firing more Sigil arrows in the middle of them.
We used Sigil arrows so we didn&rsquo;t have to jump down, as the third torch is just up and to the right of this spot at the top.</p><h2 id=midgard-the-oarsman-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Midgard The Oarsman Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#midgard-the-oarsman-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>The Oarsman Nornir Chest is located inside the building near the statue itself, by the Mystic Gateway.
This is a bell ringing rune puzzle, which means you need to ring all three bells very quickly in order to unlock the chest.
To gain access to all three bells, however, you need to open a path. Climb up the wall to the left of the locked gate to start.
Keep following this path and you&rsquo;ll eventually meet a Huntress sub-boss. Deal with her by aiming for her horns to stagger her. Once she&rsquo;s killed, climb the golden chain, then interact with the large silver chain at the top to reveal a door back into the building.
Opening the door at the end of this corridor will bring you back to the room with the Nornir Chest. Clear the Sonic debris beside this door to clear a path to one of the bells.
Then, go back into the room with the chest and hit the bell inside the crack in the wall first.
Run and hit the bell by the door you just opened next.
Turn around and hit the bell across the cavern last.</p><h2 id=midgard-the-lost-treasury-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Midgard The Lost Treasury Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#midgard-the-lost-treasury-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>This Nornir Chest is outside the Lost Treasury door, and to unlock it you&rsquo;ll have to clear a path to the inside, which you&rsquo;ll come to naturally as part of the &lsquo;Sigrun&rsquo;s Curse&rsquo; Favour.
The first step is to move the giant shield blocking the door all the way to the right and use it to climb up to the top of the treasury building. Then, clear the debris by throwing your axe.
Go through the door, and after you&rsquo;ve dealt with the enemies, look up and to the right of where you entered to see the first torch. Use your Sigil Arrows to make a path and light it with your blades.
Go back down to where the Nornir Chest is and move the shield to the left, you&rsquo;ll have uncovered the second torch, which you also need to make a line of Sigil Arrows to and light that way.
To get to the third torch, you have to find a way into the treasury, so make sure the shield is on the left and climb it to the top and move that column you unearthed by blowing up the debris previously to the left, blocking the shield&rsquo;s path.
Go to the wheel in front of the gate and turn it all the way down, then fire a Sigil Arrow at both gears, throw your axe at one, recall it, and then throw it at the other gear. Quickly run into the treasury before the ice melts.
When inside, destroy the silver seal to open the treasury door and let your companion in, then use their Sigil Arrows to make a line to the third and final torch, to the right of the Legendary Chest.</p><h2 id=midgard-raider-hideout-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Midgard Raider Hideout Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#midgard-raider-hideout-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>This Nornir Chest is located inside the Raider Hideout found under the path leading to the King&rsquo;s Grave and Mystic Gateway.
Once the raiders are dealt with, pick up a Fire Bomb and throw it at the debris between the red tapestries to light the torch behind it.
The second torch is to the left of the first, tucked in the corner, and you&rsquo;ll need to use your Sigil Arrows and blade to clear the red bramble first, then use the Sigil Arrows again to make a line to the torch. Light the line with the Blades of Chaos to reach the torch.
The third torch is near the entrance, at the end of the large cavern to the right. You&rsquo;ll need to make a horizontal line with Sigil Arrows to the torch, then throw a fire bomb at the purple bubbles to light it.</p><h2 id=god-of-war-ragnarök-muspelheim-nornir-chest-locations-explained>God of War Ragnarök Muspelheim Nornir chest locations explained<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#god-of-war-ragnarök-muspelheim-nornir-chest-locations-explained>#</a></h2><p>There are two Nornir Chests to find in Muspelheim, and to locate them all, you&rsquo;ll have to complete &lsquo;The Summoning&rsquo; Path main quest and find the two Muspelheim seeds to unlock The Crucible Trials area.</p><h2 id=muspelheim-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-1-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Muspelheim Nornir Chest puzzle solution 1 and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#muspelheim-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-1-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>The Nornir Chest in Muspelheim is behind a glowing yellow crack in the wall which you need to blow up with your spear.
This is a torch lighting rune puzzle in which you need to light all three torches with your Chaos Blades to unlock the chest, with a little help from Sigil Arrows.
The first torch is up and to the right of the chest. Use Sigil arrows to make a line up to it and then light with Kratos&rsquo; Blades.
The second and third torches are across the way to the left of the chest, but you have to leave the chest area and take a right to make a line with Runic Arrows from it to Kratos to be able to light it.
To light the third torch, go back to the chest area and make a line from the unlit torch to the lit one. Hitting the lit torch with a Runic Arrow will then cause an explosion that will flow through the purple bubbles and light the third torch.</p><h2 id=muspelheim-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-2-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Muspelheim Nornir Chest puzzle solution 2 and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#muspelheim-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-2-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>The second Nornir Chest in Muspelheim can only be opened by taking part in Crucible challenges marked by a sword with a rune. You need to complete both challenges associated with each sword. To get to this area, you&rsquo;ll have to find both Muspelheim Seeds first.
The first sword rune trial is up one floor and to the left of the actual chest.
The second sword rune trial is up two floors and to the right of the chest. Use your blades to jump up to the second level, then turn left.
The third sword rune trial is found by taking a right instead of a left after using your blades to jump up to the second level of the area. So just down from the second one.</p><h2 id=niflheim-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>Niflheim Nornir Chest puzzle solution and location in God of War Ragnarök<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#niflheim-nornir-chest-puzzle-solution-and-location-in-god-of-war-ragnarök>#</a></h2><p>The only Nornir Chest in Niflheim is found two floors up from the bottom of the Aesir Prison. You&rsquo;ll have to destroy walls and use your spear to make your way up to the actual chest.
All you have to do to open this chest is to destroy regular runes. The first rune is opposite the chest itself.
The second rune is one floor down, behind a gate containing one one of the prisoners.
The third rune is on the bottom floor, on the patch of ice in the middle.
