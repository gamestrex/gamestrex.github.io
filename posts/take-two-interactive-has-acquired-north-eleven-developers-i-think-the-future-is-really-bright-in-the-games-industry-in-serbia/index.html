Northeus is known for its mobile football management game Top Eleven which has a total of 240 million registered users. It makes the top 11 football teams the first football match they have ever played. To learn more about that acquisition, take-Twos push mobile and the consequences of the Serbian games industry, we sat with the nordeus CEO Branko Milutinovic and Michael Worosz, EVP, Head of Corporate Development \u0026 Independent Publishing at Take-Two Interactive. Take-Two first approached Nordeus in 2014 about a potential acquisition, but were reluctant to participate in M\u0026A talks at that time. Meanwhile, the companies have kept in contact over the years, with the possibility of purchasing Nordeus late last year. FALLING PACKOW! Michael Worosz, Take-Two Interactive. For now has been the focus of Take-Two, what Worosz says. A lot of people are interested in the top eleven, but because it’s so successful that the game is running for ten years. More than a hundred and thirty-five has grown tremendously. It was a very good year in 2020, he says, and particularly in 2021. I think in the M\u0026A and deal making, especially in mobile free to play where the fortunes of the business change forever, the thing you always want to consider in acquisitions is to catch a falling knife Buying a business that is slipping upward. And in the end, it’s just opposite. This business grows a month after month. So, I think our time is perfect. And true that the pay is based on the experience of Branko and the team at Nordeus. The company acted independently since its founding in 2010, in the West End. Why has it agreed to join Take-Two, especially since it was previously reluctant to discuss acquisition? And why then? explains Ms. Why is this true. Over the decades, I’ve met more or less everyone from that industry, especially with mobile users. And I think it’s possible with Take-Two culture to meet and achieve the most goals. I think we share many things together, and that it’s not uncommon to continue with this partnership. And then the reason is because of the many synergies that we feel that will multiply what we want to achieve over the next few years. As Michael mentioned, we have experienced a lot of growth over the past year and a half, maybe two. We’ve got a strong position in mobile football in multiple ways. And we see plenty of opportunities to grow further, and partnering with Take-Two will unlock lots of that growth. And when we look at longer term plans, I really feel a bit excited about what we have together to do. This is a third acquisition in the mobile space. The company bought Social Point in 2017 in Barcelona and bought Playdots later this year. It surely seems that Take-Two is keen to enter the mobile ecosystem deeper. I think the mobile free to play ecosystem is still very fragmented, says Worosz. There hasn’t been a significant roll up, although other large players have been doing a lot of deal making and picking up great teams and studios. And I think that’s true for us, too. We’re seeing a lot of opportunity there. We probably underestimated mobile, relative to our peers and businesses. And remunerated for lost ground in there. But were really building the business so much deliberately with strong organic launches, great new products coming from our existing teams and then a lot of strategic initiatives like this, which rewarded the best teams in the world. SERBIAS INDUSTRY ON RISE! Branko-Milutinovic, Nordeus. For that, a deal in the world could see potential benefits beyond Nordeus and Take-Two. The Belgrade-based Nippon is a big construction business, with the aim of improving the quality of life in Serbia and improving the quality of work. Since the company’s start, it has launched a series of initiatives to give back to the community, to improve the public health and education sector and to focus on early childhood development. The company has also done a lot of work to get up the ballparks in Serbia. North West partnered with the Digital Science-Serious Initiative and the Serbian Games Association as well as the Nordeus Hub, all to help people into the Games Industry. These initiatives help push Serbia’s games industry on the map, and as an enormous company like Take-Two already gets in a foothold in the country, it certainly seems to have accomplished that. I wouldn’t say it’s a reason for this, but it’s a wonderful, positive side effect of this deal, says Milutinovic. The gaming ecosystem in Serbia has lots of room to improve. We’re a lot better than we used to be five or ten years ago, but the potential is still much higher than we achieved. And I feel that together [with Take-Two], you can put more energy into the local ecosystem and get to an even better place. I think this is great effect. And I am glad to see what my position and the role will be for that impact, because it really touched a lot of people in a positive way. The engineering genius we found in Belgrade, and also in Serbia, Worosz adds. We were really excited by the future for Nordeus and other potential Take-Two investments in that region. In 2017 when we got Social Point, we arrived early in the Barcelona Games market. Now that that local was blown up with so many other business coming in, that would have happened in Serbia. I think the future is very bright in the play industry in Serbia. And of course continued Nero the charity efforts in the future. And as Worosz continues to say, Milutinovic himself has a hand in building this bright future for Serbians: he and his wife worked out: he got to a point in giving a wink to the industry, he was unable to say. Branko is a proud nationalist, and the formation of northeus is very cool. After getting married, Branko, Ivan and Milan worked together, they came together and realised that they were each from different parts of Serbia, and decided to go back home and start something new. I think that the pride of the country comes through in that story. And Branko is being modest, he gives up a lot of his time helping young players who are emerging from the games industry, and to grow talent in an ecosystem that isn’t behind his headquarters. And it seems that ecosystem will benefit from Take-Twos investment in the region. I totally feel it, says Milutinovic. |I think it’s a statement that you know something is happening. And that we’re having a company called Take-Two, which in my opinion leads in the entertainment industry by innovation, creativity, efficiency and innovation, and people are at the heart of that. Even when you look more objectively, that’s an S\u0026P 500 gaming company. If you had a job like that, investing a little in new geography and being among the first ones, it reflects an example difficult to ignore. I hope in the next few years, you know, were gonna show how that got to happen and strengthen that type of investment. I really hope the movie will look like a mystery over the next five years. From Take-Two to Nordeus and Serbia’s industry, they look excited about their future together. What a wonderful deal do I think about the next chapter with Nordeus, says Worosz. Work as partner, and we do have enormous ambitions for the future of Take-Two, in particular in our mobile initiatives. That’s another step for the journey.\n","wordCount":"1300","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Luis Perez"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/take-two-interactive-has-acquired-north-eleven-developers-i-think-the-future-is-really-bright-in-the-games-industry-in-serbia/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Take Two Interactive Has Acquired North Eleven Developers I Think The Future Is Really Bright In The Games Industry In Serbia</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 1, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1300 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Luis Perez</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>Following the acquisition, Nordeus founding team of Branko Milutinovic (CEO), Milan Jovovic (CCO), Ivan Stojisavljevic (CTO) and Tomislav Mihajlovic will continue to supervise the studio and its approximately 180 employees.
