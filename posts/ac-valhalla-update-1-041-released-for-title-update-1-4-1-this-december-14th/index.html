Those who wear the Fallen Hero gear would disappear, and the face of the body and legs could disappear. The seax from the ealdorman outfit could disappear randomly, using different weapons. A badge of the roe was the worst to die. As a result, a swarm of explosives may create an invisible barrier, causing subsequent missiles to collide with an invisible wall. In the Henlocan Outpost Trial, an Enemy NPC could often jump from their stations to the wenlocan Outpost Trial of the Bear.\nUI/HUD are the mainstays of the organization.
