This shouldn’t be mistaken for a major update that contains new content that have more fanfare than this, Nintendo insists that new content shouldn’t be released for Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The most significant bug in this update was a major bug that Nintendo introduced earlier this week. In addition, there was a problem that would happen when players try and remodel the house of villagers while their gate is open. Animal Crossing is already working very hard over the past week as well as many other fixes have also been made. Other bug fixes for versions 2.0 include an incomplete Sanrio item in Nook Shopping, missing DIY crafting recipes under certain tabs, poor villagers cooking on the wrong furniture item, and a number more. A major overhaul was made for the Happy Home Paradise DLC, and the school was all focused on that facility. According to Nintendo, if you don’t design school facilities earlier, there are two ways to fix your save data according to the appropriate conditions. For players who haven’t remodeled the school: After completing 1 or 2 other jobs, no other events trigger the event to design the school at the time of the first, the school’s outcome will trigger. If you do something for the school to design, the items that normally unlock from the event will become a habit when you start your next job. The problem with this is serious in resolving the problem which made many a timely move at the version 2.0 update. Nintendo promised only a fix by the end of November, and had surprised me. Below is the full official patch notes for the version 2.0.1 of Animal Crossing: New Horizons released on November 11, 2021 in English by Nintendo.\nOfficial Patch Notes for Animal Crossing: New Horizons Version 2.0.1 (English) Ver. 2.0.1 (Released November 11, 2021) If the version notation on the upper right of the software title screen is Ver. 2.0.1, the latest version was made.\nFixed Issues A problem that might happen if a player wants to remodel a resident home while the gate of the airport is closed. Fixed the issue where the item’s for sale in Kiki \u0026 Lala appeared incorrectly in nook shopping as not. There was an issue in which the coconut juice and frozen-treat set items don’t appear under the table « Miscellaneous recipes ». Fixed a problem where the fanned floor furniture wouldn’t fit in Photopia or expanded player homes when placed horizontally. A problem where some residents would try to cook with a kitchen item inside their home. Fixed an issue where residents who saw the player home talk like they were in the café.\nFixed issues regarding DLC. The following problems in relation to the paid DLC Animal Crossing: New Horizons Happy Home Paradise are fixed.\nFixed an issue that would allow players to move the game without designing the school, where normal, it would require that the school be built. If you have data that you went without designing the school, use this method to restore the data to the proper condition. There are players who haven’t remodeled the school: after they finish two or three jobs and at that time, an event to design the school will be triggered. When you start an assignment, the special events for the schools will not trigger, but the features that usually unlock from the event to the school will become useable when you restart work. The issue was fixed by using amiibo to change members in a facility. Fixed a problem in which you could often obtain turnips from Joan in the hospital. Fixed the problem that the ripe plant item was able to use by picking tomatoes for sale.\nPlease note that you must be updated to Version 2.0.1, so that you can play online multiplayer with other players and access other network features from now on.
