Uncharted 4 Treasures and collectibles guideLocations for every last treasure, journal entry, journal note and conversation in Uncharted 4. No Uncharted game would be complete without things to collect, and A Thief’s End is no exception. There are four types of “collectible” in the game, and gathering them earns you points to spend on character skins, cheats, concept art, and some fun visual and gameplay modification tweaks. The first and most numerous of the collectibles are the Treasures - 109 in total. These are physical objects of interest dotted around the game world: occasionally they’re obvious, but more often than not they’re tucked in out-of-the-way or hard-to-reach places, and you can spot them as small glints of light. Second are Journal Notes. These are scraps of paper or parchment hidden away in a similar fashion to Treasures. They’re not as numerous (only 23), but they’re also not as visually obvious. Third we have Journal Entries. These are points of interest that Nathan will sketch or jot down a few words about in his journal - an interesting gravestone, a curious marking on a building - and there are 25 of them to be found. Finally, Optional Conversations. These 36 snippets of conversation are not essential to the plot but often provide insight into a character’s thoughts (along with the odd wiseass remark). Sometimes they’re automatically triggered by a plot event, but other times they require you to perform a specific action in a certain location. They’re also time- and context-sensitive, so if you hear a rattling noise and see a speech bubble pop up, stop what you’re doing and talk to your companion before the moment passes. Unlockables Collecting all the things isn’t just for scratching a compulsive itch. There are a number of unlockables that you can “purchase” with points accrued by picking up the optional extras - there’s concept art for each level, character models to admire, skins to unlock, plus some game modifiers to use once you’ve completed the game. You can buy the ability to give Nathan any weapon you fancy, add some fun or stylish render modes to the visuals, plus a list of other tweaks that verge from useful to outright ridiculous:\nMirror World: flips all the level maps left-to-right. Mirror on Death: as above, but flips back and forth every time you die. Slow Motion: slows everything down to about half speed. Bullet Speed Mode: slows everything down when you’re aiming your gun. No Gravity: passive physics objects (debris, dead enemies, etc.) drift around like they’re in low gravity. 8-Bit Audio: reduces audio quality. 4-Bit Audio: reduces audio quality even more. Helium Audio: increases the pitch of the audio. Xenon Audio: decreases the pitch of the audio. Infinite Ammo: never run out of bullets again.\nCombat This isn’t really a combat-focused game, so don’t expect deep tactics - it’s just a diversion from all the jumping and climbing and helps pace the game. Uncharted 4 uses a hybrid stealth and cover system, but it’s not overly complicated: if enemies haven’t spotted you then you have a few silent takedown options available, and there’s the usual array of waist-high boxes and walls to hide behind when the bullets start to fly. The combat areas are usually filled with places to throw in some fancy acrobatics while you fight, but this often proves to be more dangerous than useful, and the lock-on system is somewhat overenthusiastic and can actually hinder rather than help a lot of the time, so you may prefer to play with it off. By default, Nathan’s only equipped with a fairly weedy pistol, but enemies will leave behind quite an array of alternatives. You can carry one sidearm (ranging from pistols to small-calibre Uzi-like weapons) and one “long weapon” at a time, as well as four sticks of dynamite or four grenades. Some weapon drops are gold, and these are significantly more powerful than the others, but often there’s only one per area meaning there’s no chance to replenish your ammo.\n","wordCount":"1125","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-15T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-15T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Allison Ultseh"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/uncharted-4-walkthrough-and-guide/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Uncharted 4 Walkthrough And Guide</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-15 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 15, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1125 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Allison Ultseh</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>Although we don&rsquo;t discuss any plot events in this Uncharted 4 guide, needless to say the full game is covered, including all the chapter titles and locations and some of the characters involved, and naturally some events are impossible to avoid.
