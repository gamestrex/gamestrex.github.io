In fact, at a (somewhat premature)\rlaunch party back in September, UT’s bots passed the Turing Test by\rfooling me into thinking they were real players for almost half an\rhour!\rEpic have done a great job of making the bots behave like humans,\rand in almost every situation they work perfectly. You can even\rgive your AI team mates basic orders in team games using a\rstraightforward drag and click interface.\rThere are a few problems though, the most obvious being the AI’s\rinability to deal with windows. Stand a bot at a window and it will\rkeep shooting, even when the target on the ground below gets so\rclose that the bot ends up shooting at the wall underneath the\rwindow trying to hit it.\rOtherwise they make convincing opponents though. Their aim isn’t\rinhumanly good (unless you set their skill to “inhuman” of course),\rand they don’t have eyes in the backs of their heads.\rAnd because there are eight skill levels to choose from, ranging\rfrom “novice” to “godlike”, they should provide a reasonable\rchallenge to anybody from Joe Newbie to Thresh.\rDeathmatch is very fast paced, and most of the two dozen maps on\roffer are excellent. There are a few novelty maps though, and some\rof these just don’t work.\rOne is set on board a galleon, and although it looks great you\rreally don’t have time to stop and admire the scenery. What you do\rhave time to notice though is the fact that it is poorly\rinterconnected and badly cluttered… Nice idea, but it just\rdoesn’t work for deathmatch.\rSome of the novelty maps are rather good though. DM_Morpheus is\rinspired by the “Woah” scene from The Matrix, and sees players\rleaping between the roofs of skyscrapers. Surprisingly it works,\rand is one of the most enjoyable maps in the game.\rCTF should also be familiar to any first person shooter fan, a\rbasic teamplay option in which you attempt to capture a flag from\rthe other team and then bring it back to your own base.\rUT CTF is probably the best I’ve ever played, with fast-paced\rgameplay and some truly excellent maps. The real gem is “Facing\rWorlds”, featuring a pair of giant towers facing each other across\ra narrow strip of land suspended in space. This map is sniper\rheaven, with the tops of the two towers providing a vantage point\rfrom which you can see most of the map.\rDomination is similar to the “Capture And Hold” mode in Starsiege\rTribes. The idea is to control certain locations scattered around\rthe map. The longer your team controls one, the more points you\rscore.\rWhat really makes Assault mode shine though are the maps. One\rrelives the D-Day Normandy landings, with one team starting in a\rlanding vessel and the other team trying to stop them from storming\rthe beaches and destroying a massive cannon in the cliff face\rbehind.\rOther maps involve breaking into a frigate, escaping from a castle,\rdestroying an underwater laboratory, and taking control of a high\rspeed train. All are excellently designed, and great fun to play ..\ragainst bots. Unfortunately over the internet it is a whole\rdifferent story.\rThe problem is that many of us have already found ways to complete\rmost of the maps within a minute! Essentially this turns the game\rinto a mad dash, with the best players on the attacking team\rcharging headlong through the level trying to reach their\robjectives, while the defenders desperately try to stop any of them\rfrom breaking through.\rAll it takes is one or two good players on the attacking team and\rthe defenders are likely to lose, and lose fast. Well balanced\rgames are very enjoyable, but as soon as one team gains any sort of\radvantage it soon turns into a farce.\rIf you like “speed running” then Assault mode will probably suit\ryou, and there is something strangely enjoyable in dashing through\rthe level faster than anybody else has done before. But it is\rlikely to wear thin fast…\rWhich is a shame, because at first this seemed to be the best of\rthe games on offer in Unreal Tournament.\rThe game has a whole set of “mutators” which can be applied in\ralmost any combination to any of the main gameplay modes. There is\ra rocket arena mutator, which lets all the players duel it out with\rrocket launchers. There is a low gravity option, which makes life\rrather interesting.\rThe instagib mutator arms everybody with enhanced shock rifles that\rwill reduce anything they hit to a steaming pile of meaty bits.\rWhich is nice…\rThere’s even a rather bizarre mutator which makes you gain or lose\rweight depending on how many kills you have. The more times you get\rkilled, the more like Kate Moss your character looks. The more\rtimes you kill your enemies, the more you look like Santa Claus\rafter a few too many mincepies. Strange, but true.\rThe best part though is that players will be able to modify Unreal\rTournament themselves, creating their own mutators, maps, or even\rwhole new gameplay styles. The first user-made mutators have\ralready started to appear, and more add-ons are likely to follow.\rFor newcomers to the whole first person shooter genre, there are\rtutorial maps for each game type to introduce you to basic concepts\rlike strafing, picking up items, capturing flags, and aiming and\rfiring your weapons using a mouse.\rThe interface is easy to use, and puts most other games to shame.\rIt looks and feels like Windows, and a series of drop down menus\rand resizable panes makes it easy to set up and control the game.\rWhich makes a nice change from the endless undocumented command\rline options and console settings which most previous first person\rshooters have suffered from…\rAnd even if you don’t want to take the plunge into online gaming,\rthe bots provide a great offline single player experience. They are\ralso there to practice against, meaning that even the most\rinexperienced player can pick up the basics of the game before they\rventure into a real game.\rEven for battle hardened veterans, playing through the single\rplayer campaign is highly recommended. If nothing else it gives you\ra chance to learn the levels, something which is particularly\rimportant for the Assault and CTF modes.\rWell, I have good news for you…\rThe game is perfectly playable in Direct3D mode at 800x600, even on\rmy lowly Riva-TNT powered 300Mhz Pentium II. And it looks beautiful\r- the graphics are crisp and colourful, the models are good, the\rtextures and skins are mostly excellent, and the weapon effects are\rdamned impressive.\rThe weapons themselves are chunky and powerful, and as each has two\rfiring modes you get twice the fun. The goo gun (sorry, BioRifle)\ris still hardly a weapon of choice, but everything else is top\rnotch.\rThe flak cannon doubles as both a shotgun and a shrapnel grenade\rlauncher, and works admirably in both capacities. The Redeemer is a\rrare but impressive beast that fires a miniature nuclear missile\rwhich you can remote control in the alt-fire mode!\rAnd the sniper rifle, with its awesome zoom capability, is truly\rthe King Of Guns. Nothing can match the satisfaction of pulling off\ra clean head shot on a moving target half way across the level.\rThe multiplayer code is silky smooth over a LAN or fast digital\rconnection, and works well even on a 56k modem. I found it playable\r(in the loosest sense of the word) even with pings in the 300-400\rrange, and although any comparison is rather arbritary, the\rinternet play seemed to be at least on a par with Quake II.\rIn fact, apart from a few washed-out textures, the only real\rproblem I have had with Unreal Tournament is that sometimes it\rcrashes when I quit the game, forcing a reboot.\rGiven that I’ve only actually quit half a dozen times since\rinstalling the game, that isn’t a great problem though! If I didn’t\rhave to write this damn review I’d still be playing it now…\rBoth single player and multiplayer are excellent, as are the\rmajority of the maps. The graphics are a match for anything else on\rthe market, and the game doesn’t need a supercomputer to run it.\rAnd with so many maps, modes and mutators on offer, you really are\rspoilt for choice. It’s a shame that Assault mode doesn’t usually\rwork very well online, but otherwise the game does exactly what it\rsays on the box.\rIf you’ve read this far there must be something wrong with you…\rGo buy the damn game already!\n","wordCount":"1502","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-22T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michael Ford"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/unreal-tournament/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Unreal Tournament</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 22, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1502 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Michael Ford</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>Breaking from the traditional &ldquo;find red key, use red key to open
