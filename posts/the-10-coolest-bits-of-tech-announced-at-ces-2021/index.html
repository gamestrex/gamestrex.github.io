Without further ado, here are the 10 coolest bits of tech announced at CES 2021 - including HDMI 2.1 monitors, cat robots, rollable OLEDs built into chairs and much more. That last option is only available if you pick up the 2021 ROG XG Mobile enclosure, doubling the price, but it should unlock a ridiculous amount of gaming performance in an incredibly compact design - and the enclosure also powers the laptop and provides a ton of extra USB ports for peripherals while it’s connected. Not bad for something smaller than the average gaming laptop power brick. There’s plenty more to love about the ROG Flow X13 itself too, including a 360° hinge, a choice of 4K or 1080p 120Hz 16:10 displays, high performance LPDDR4X-4266 memory and 100W USB-C fast charging. Of course, all of this won’t come cheap, but the Flow X13 is still an immensely exciting laptop that’s worth knowing about. If you’re after something a little more traditional, Asus has updated their popular Zephyrus G14 laptop with a Ryzen 5900HS CPU and RTX 3060 graphics; there’s also a new 15-inch G15 that has up to an RTX 3080 and a more affordable Tuf F15 with an 11th-gen Intel processor and up to an RTX 3070. There were very few products announced at CES where I immediately said, “wow, I want one of those” and really meant it, but for Project Hazel I’m 100 per cent on board. If we’re going to be fighting COVID for weeks and months to come, then I’ll be damned if I do without a rechargeable face mask that blows out hot air, lights up in millions of colours and gives me a booming voice. Razer, take my money. That’s a question I got a lot last year with the release of the Xbox Series X and PS5, and the only real answer was that there weren’t any - unless you counted LG’s 48-inch CX OLED as a monitor. Now though, HDMI 2.1 displays seem to finally coming to market, and the most exciting I’ve seen so far is LG’s LG27GP950. This catchily titled display has a 4K resolution and can be overclocked from its 144Hz native refresh rate all the way to 160Hz, a new high for a 4K monitor. Over HDMI, you’ll be limited to 4K 120Hz, but you do get all of the usual HDMI 2.1 features too, including Auto Low Latency Mode and HDMI Forum VRR, as supported by the Xbox Series X/S. There’s also G-Sync and FreeSync for using the display with AMD or Nvidia graphics cards. Finally, the Nano IPS panel used meets the rather strict DisplayHDR 600 requirements, meaning it can hit 600 nits of brightness for HDR highlights that really pop. Of course, the LG27GP950 won’t be the only HDMI 2.1 monitor on the market this year. There’s the Eve Spectrum, which I recently had a chance to test (sadly sans working HDMI 2.1 support) and other recent announcements like the Asus PG32UQ, a 32-inch HDMI 2.1 monitor that could be a better choice for those with bigger budgets and bigger spaces. I’m sure we’ll see other options too, which is great news for anyone searching for the best monitor for their PS5 or Series X. Lenovo also announced a bunch of slightly more traditional laptops, including one that caught my eye: the ThinBook Plus Gen 2, a laptop with a 12-inch e-ink touch display on the back of the standard screen. The e-ink portion is bigger, higher-res and has a higher refresh rate than the original model that appeared at last year’s show, hopefully making it more useful for note-taking, to-do-list ticking and calendar-checking. E-ink feels perennially just like it’s about to break out of the e-reader category, so perhaps this will be the standout success that makes e-ink laptops viable? That sounds pretty lame, but the mere existence of the A1 suggests that this OLED TV is going to be significantly more affordable than its BX predecessor, thereby allowing a whole new population to experience the benefits of OLED - near-infinite contrast, wide viewing angles, perfect pixel-response time and so on. All of these can really make games come alive, to say nothing of films and TV, so the prospect of a sub-£1000/$1000 OLED is exciting. The Alloy Origins 60 comes with PBT keycaps, normally a premium aftermarket upgrade, HyperX’s own red linear switches, a detachable USB-C cable and reprogrammable keys. HyperX are offering the Alloy Origins 60 at $100, a lower price than the Fnatic Streak 65 ($110) or Razer Huntsman Mini ($120), so if the quality is there then this could be an excellent introduction to the new smaller size. It won’t be affordable - UltraFine displays never are - but it marks an important first step towards OLED screens becoming viable on the desktop. This should be an awesome choice for designers and content creators, who’ll be able to make use of that high pixel density and excellent colour accuracy, and it gives companies like LG an opportunity to figure out how best to adapt OLED for desktop use. LG Display, part of the same chaebol as LG Electronics, are making a bunch of 20-32 inch displays over the next year and I pray that as many as possible will make it into monitors like this one - except, you know, cheaper. The chair looks fairly ordinary at first, but then you notice that it has a desk built into the arm rests for your keyboard and mouse… and a 60-inch rollable OLED screen (!!) that deploys from behind your head. Oh, and there’s RGB lighting, haptic motors for insane vibrations, a carbon fibre seat and cable routing for your peripherals. In a quieter year this insane combination could well have taken the top spot uncontested, so it speaks to how 2021 is going right now that Project Brooklyn only just scrapes a mention in this list. 8K gaming is technically possible today in some games with DLSS and a very high-end graphics card - even if it doesn’t really make sense - so there’s an argument to be made that picking up an 8K TV provides a small degree of future-proofing… as long as you don’t intend to upgrade again for another five or ten years. Regardless, it’s an interesting development and one that could spur the beginning of mainstream 8K adoption. Update: We also didn’t get to include MSI’s wares in this roundup as their non-laptop event was held after its original publication, but the firm’s MEG Z590 Godlike motherboard, MPG Artymis monitor and Coreliquid K360 AiO are definitely fine examples of the balls-to-the-wall spirit that makes CES great.
