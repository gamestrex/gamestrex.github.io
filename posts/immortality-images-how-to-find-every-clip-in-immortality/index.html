To help you find every clip in Ambrosio, Minsky, and Two of Everything to complete your search into what happened to Marissa Marcel, we’ve listed every image you should click on in Immortality, and have also noted some easily missed clips that require some dedicated searching techniques. On this page:\nHow to find every clip in Immortality explained There are a total of 202 clips to find in Immortality. For quick reference to see how many you still need to get for each of Marissa Marcel’s unreleased movies, here’s how many clips there are in total for Ambrosio, Minsky, and Two of Everything:\nAmbrosio - 76 clips Minsky - 69 clips Two of Everything - 57 clips\nYou’ll get an individual achievement for finding all of the clips in Ambrosio, Minsky, and Two of Everything. Once you’ve found all 202 scenes in the game, you’ll also get the ‘Cinephile’ achievement. Just keep in mind that even though you might have found every clip in Immortality you may not have seen all of the story. We won’t spoil how to do this, as you don’t need to watch this content in order to complete your clip collection, but we highly recommend trying to find it in order to experience the full scope of Immortality’s story.\nAll Immortality images list We’re not going to split the Immortality images list into separate lists for each movie, as clicking on an image could take you to Ambrosio, Minsky, or Two of Everything at random. However, we will note if you need to focus on a particular image to help find all clips for a certain movie, and will go into more detail on it in the ’easily missed images’ section below this list. To keep it simple and easily readable, we’ve not included the name of every cast and crew member’s face you need to click on, as their name is often a mystery, and there are a lot of people involved in each of the three movies. Clicking on a main cast member’s face will take you the longest, as they naturally appear in a lot of scenes. Whereas clicking on a crew member, or interviewer, can only randomly send you to a small number of scenes. Due to this, we recommend starting your search with unique props first, then crew members’ faces, then main cast members’ faces when trying to find every clip in the game. With all this in mind, here’s every image you need to click on in Immortality to find every clip:\nEvery main cast members’ face Every crew members’ face Every background actors’ face (but not every one takes you to another clip) The two talkshow hosts’ faces Marissa Marcel’s face (will need to click on a lot to find an easily missed clip in Minsky)\nAnything containing alcohol Ashtrays Bags/purses/baskets/suitcases Beds/props meant to be beds Bins/bin bags Birds/bird props Blood/spilled red wine Books Boxes/packaging Cameras Cars Cat/cat prop Chairs/stools/seats Chandeliers Cigarettes/someone holding a cigarette\nCity skylines Clapperboards/pegs Close up of eyeballs (easily missed scene in Minsky) Close up of hands Coffee cups/mugs/takeaway cups Columns/pillars Crucifix/cross (easily missed scene in Minsky) Curtain/window/blinds Cushions/pillows Doors/open doorways Fire/flames/burning Fruit/oranges/apples/olives/cucumbers (easily missed scenes in Ambrosio and Minsky) Glasses not being worn Glasses of water/water bottles Guns/gun holsters\nHarps Jackets/clothes not being worn/clothes rails Keycards/identification cards/credit cards Keys/locks (easily missed scene in Ambrosio) Kissing Knives/scissors/scalpels/anything that slices and cuts Ladders/fire escapes Lanterns Lighters Lights/lightbulbs/light sources (even the moon) Masks/things that cover the face/eyes (easily missed scene in Minsky) Microphones Mirrors Necklaces Paint palettes\nPaintbrush/makeup brush Paintings/portraits Paper/scripts Pencils/pens/quills Phones/props meant to be phones Photographs Pills/pill bottles Plants/trees/foliage Plant pots Plates/round dishes Pool water Rope (two easily missed scenes in Minsky) Rosary Beads Roses/bright flowers (two easily missed scenes in Ambrosio) Salt and pepper shakers\nShoes/socks/feet Snake/snake props (easily missed scenes in Ambrosio and Two of Everything) Statues/figurines/ornaments/sculptures TV sets Tables Tape recorders Thin white branch prop Unlit candles Watch/clock/anything that tells the time Water jugs/kettles/watering cans White magical liquid prop/green magical bottle prop (easily missed scene in Ambrosio) Written notes/letters\nEasily missed clips in Immortality If you find yourself only missing a few scenes in Immortality, and you’ve trawled through every person’s face dozens of times, you’re most likely missing one of the images below. There are 10 clips out of 202 that we would classify as easily missed in Immortality. While most can be discovered by selecting the clapperboard over and over, it’ll take a long time for the algorithm to randomly select the particular clip you’ve yet to watch.\nMarissa Marcel’s face Easily missed in: Minsky This is the last clip in Minsky, and the very last I personally found in Immortality. There are no other items or props that can take you to this clip, and a lot of scenes containing Marissa Marcel’s face, so you’re just going to have to keep match cutting to the actress until you come across this short video of Marissa speaking directly into the camera. It’s not a clip from the Minsky movie itself, this is Marissa speaking as herself.\nRoses/bright flowers Easily missed in: Ambrosio The first easily missed clip in Ambrosio contains a rose and a snake. The only other object that can take you to this clip is the clapperboard, but we don’t recommend trying to find it this way. Instead, click any other rose or bright flower you see and you’ll eventually match cut your way to this clip - or, if you come across a snake first, match cut using it instead. The second easily missed clip contains a white flower turning into a bright flower when Marissa’s hand brushes it as Matilda in Ambrosio. You can also find this scene clicking on plant pots, hands, or tables.\nCrucifixes/crosses Easily missed in: Minsky Although there are a lot of scenes containing crucifixes/crosses in Ambrosio, they all have another object or face you can match cut to easily access. There’s one scene in Minsky, however, that’s just a close up of Marissa as Franny opening a fake necklace resembling a cross. We found it easiest to click on crosses to get to this scene, but you can also use Marissa’s face, hands, or the clapperboard to eventually find it.\nWhite magical liquid prop/green magical bottle prop Easily missed in: Ambrosio This white liquid is in a few different scenes in Ambrosio, so when you come across it or the small green prop bottle, click on them repeatedly until you find this close up of the white liquid in a glass. You can also find this clip by match cutting circular plates, tables, candelabras, and the clapperboard.\nKeys/locks Easily missed in: Ambrosio Another tricky clip, as there are a fair few scenes containing keys in Ambrosio, and even a few in Minsky. Keep clicking on the keys until you get this close up shot of three hanging keys to add it to your collection Although not recommended, you can also find this clip by match cutting on clapperboards.\nMasks/things that cover the face/eyes Easily missed in: Minsky The only way to find this scene is by trawling clips with the clapperboard, or finding a clip with either rope or a mask in it. We recommend match cutting rope if you’ve found the Minsky scene containing it, or selecting the white mask in Minsky instead.\nFruit/oranges/apples/olives/cucumber Easily missed in: Ambrosio and Minsky The first easily missed clip containing fruit in Immortality is a closeup of somebody peeling an orange in Ambrosio. You should naturally find a scene with oranges in Ambrosio, so we recommend clicking on it until you come across this orange close up. The second easily missed clip containing fruit is in Minsky. It’s a close up of an apple in a bowl, with an unlit candle beside it, which you can also click on in other scenes to try and find this clip. However, we found it easiest to just keep selecting apples in order to find this Minsky scene.\nClose up of eyeballs Easily missed in: Minsky You might be able to find this clip by match cutting on the white mask found in Minsky, but it’s far easier to select an actor’s eye when you can to find this close up of Carl wearing the white mask featured in Minsky. You can also access it by selecting the clapperboard - but again, we don’t recommend doing so.\nRope Easily missed in: Minsky If you’ve found the easily missed clip containing a white mask that we’ve already mentioned above, then all you need to do is click on the rope in this scene to find the easily missed clip of Marissa cutting some rope. You can also match cut to it by selecting knives, or the clapperboard.\nSnake/snake props Easily missed in: Ambrosio and Two of Everything The first easily missed clip of a snake is in Ambrosio, and to get to it we recommend clicking on any other snake or snake prop you see and you’ll eventually match cut your way to this clip - or, if you come across a rose or bright flower first, match cut using it instead. The second easily missed clip of a snake is in Two of Everything. Just keep clicking on snake images to find your way to it. Alternatively, you can click on pool water found in Two of Everything to try and force this scene to appear. Good luck finding all of the clips in Immortality!\n","wordCount":"1621","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-08T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-08T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Karen Tang"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/immortality-images-how-to-find-every-clip-in-immortality/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Immortality Images How To Find Every Clip In Immortality</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-08 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 8, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1621 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Karen Tang</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#how-to-find-every-clip-in-immortality-explained>How to find every clip in Immortality explained</a></li><li><a href=#all-immortality-images-list>All Immortality images list</a></li><li><a href=#easily-missed-clips-in-immortality>Easily missed clips in Immortality</a><ul><li><a href=#marissa-marcels-face>Marissa Marcel&rsquo;s face</a></li><li><a href=#rosesbright-flowers>Roses/bright flowers</a></li><li><a href=#crucifixescrosses>Crucifixes/crosses</a></li><li><a href=#white-magical-liquid-propgreen-magical-bottle-prop>White magical liquid prop/green magical bottle prop</a></li><li><a href=#keyslocks>Keys/locks</a></li><li><a href=#masksthings-that-cover-the-faceeyes>Masks/things that cover the face/eyes</a></li><li><a href=#fruitorangesapplesolivescucumber>Fruit/oranges/apples/olives/cucumber</a></li><li><a href=#close-up-of-eyeballs>Close up of eyeballs</a></li><li><a href=#rope>Rope</a></li><li><a href=#snakesnake-props>Snake/snake props</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>As there&rsquo;s no limit to how many clips you can find by using this &lsquo;match cut&rsquo; feature to search for additional scenes to each of the game&rsquo;s three movies, there are some clips that will take you longer to unearth than others.

The first easily missed clip containing fruit in Immortality is a closeup of somebody peeling an orange in Ambrosio. You should naturally find a scene with oranges in Ambrosio, so we recommend clicking on it until you come across this orange close up.
The second easily missed clip containing fruit is in Minsky. It&rsquo;s a close up of an apple in a bowl, with an unlit candle beside it, which you can also click on in other scenes to try and find this clip. However, we found it easiest to just keep selecting apples in order to find this Minsky scene.</p><h3 id=close-up-of-eyeballs>Close up of eyeballs<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#close-up-of-eyeballs>#</a></h3><p>Easily missed in: Minsky
You might be able to find this clip by match cutting on the white mask found in Minsky, but it&rsquo;s far easier to select an actor&rsquo;s eye when you can to find this close up of Carl wearing the white mask featured in Minsky. You can also access it by selecting the clapperboard - but again, we don&rsquo;t recommend doing so.</p><h3 id=rope>Rope<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#rope>#</a></h3><p>Easily missed in: Minsky
If you&rsquo;ve found the easily missed clip containing a white mask that we&rsquo;ve already mentioned above, then all you need to do is click on the rope in this scene to find the easily missed clip of Marissa cutting some rope. You can also match cut to it by selecting knives, or the clapperboard.</p><h3 id=snakesnake-props>Snake/snake props<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#snakesnake-props>#</a></h3><p>Easily missed in: Ambrosio and Two of Everything
The first easily missed clip of a snake is in Ambrosio, and to get to it we recommend clicking on any other snake or snake prop you see and you&rsquo;ll eventually match cut your way to this clip - or, if you come across a rose or bright flower first, match cut using it instead.
The second easily missed clip of a snake is in Two of Everything. Just keep clicking on snake images to find your way to it. Alternatively, you can click on pool water found in Two of Everything to try and force this scene to appear.
Good luck finding all of the clips in Immortality!</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/Immortality-images%2C-how-to-find-every-clip-in-Immortality-explained.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/Immortality-images%2C-how-to-find-every-clip-in-Immortality-explained.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Immortality images  how to find every clip in Immortality -
