You should receive an email when you have confirmed access. Note that progress from the flight will not carry over to the full game, as it will be a seperate client to the main game itself ahead of the full August launch. Access to the Halo Infinite flight requires you download the Xbox Insider Hub app on Xbox consoles, which is Microsoft’s way of allowing users to download pre-release software. To download the Xbox Insider app on Xbox platforms, perform the following steps:\nScroll down the home screen of the dashboard and open the store. Search for “Insider” (for us, it also appeared in the ’trending’ bar automatically, which will be quicker). Download the Xbox Insider Hub app. Once downloaded, navigate to the Previews section and download the Halo Infinite - Insider client. From there, the Halo Infinite flight will begin downloading. Note that progress from the flight will not carry over to the full game, as it will be a seperate client to the main game itself ahead of the full August launch. Once you have signed up, a unique code will be sent via the Halo Insider portal for you to download and access the flight. Based on previous flights, it’s worth checking both the Halo Insider portal as well as your email inbox during the week to ensure you have access!
