Otherwise, we’ve a Teamfight Tactics items cheat sheet and a Teamfight Tactics tier list to give you an idea on who’s strong right now, too.\rNEW ORIGIN AND CHAMPIONS The Hextechs\nThe Hextech champions are all strong and serve their own purpose, but together they give some counterplay to items. But the bomb itself can be played around. We hope this adds a new and interesting dynamic to play around. Trait: Throw a bomb at an enemy unit with an item, and disables all items in a 1/2 hex radius for 8 seconds.\nCamille\nAbility: Camille’s ability, The Hextech Ultimatum, roots an enemy and forces her in-range teammates to target whomever she’s fighting. Class: Blademaster Cost: 1 Gold Ability Damage: 200/325/450\nJayce\nAbility: Disrupts the enemy frontline by knocking back an enemy unit with his Thundering Blow. He then switches to his Mercury Cannon bringing increased attack speed and ranged damage. Class: Shapeshifter Cost: 2 Gold Ability Damage: 200/350/500\nVi\nAbility: Targets the farthest enemy and charges towards them, knocking aside and damaging every enemy along the way. Once she gets there, she knocks her target up and damages them. Class: Brawler Cost: 3 Gold\rAbility Damage: 250/450/650\nJinx\nAbility: Gets Excited after her first takedown, gaining bonus attack speed. If she scores a second takedown she pulls out Fishbones, her rocket launcher, causing her attacks to deal AoE damage. Class: Gunslinger Cost: 4 Gold Rocket Damage: 100/225/350 magic damage in an explosion that covers 3 hexes total.\nSYSTEMS Matchmaking\nWe’ve improved how the player matching works to prevent the streaky scenarios where you would face the same player (or ghost army) two or more times in a row. Now this should happen almost never.\nURF Overtime Mode\nNow, 30 seconds in to every battle, URF Overtime kicks in and speeds things up for 15 seconds. Draws are still possible but there should be a lot less of them. 30 seconds into every battle the URF Overtime bonus will activate. 300% Attack Speed 200% Ability Damage 66% reduced Crowd Control duration 66% Healing Reduction 30% increased affection towards maritime mammals.\nRanked Changes\nAs intended, everyone will now be demoted if you lose LP in any game you start at 0LP. For Grandmaster and Challenger players, if you’re demoted you will now skip Master and go directly to Diamond 1. This is now true in League of Legends as well. We’ve also made adjustments to LP gains and losses underneath the hood for extreme edge cases. For the most part, you will not see or feel any changes based on this optimization.\nPlayer Damage\nBase damage now scales with current stage. Stages 1-2: 1 damage Stage 3-4: 2 damage Stage 5: 3 damage Stage 6: 4 damage Stage 7+: 5 damage\nTRAITS Brawler\nBrawlers are quite strong and are getting a bit too much free health so we’re toning that down a bit. Bonus Health: 300/700/1200 ⇒ 300/600/1000\nDemon\nWe’ve redesigned the Demon trait bonus to not be quite the shutdown of ability dependent units like it was before. Instead, Demons drain mana allowing them to cast their spells faster. Demon basic attacks have a 40% chance to burn 20 mana from their target and return 15/30/45 mana to the attacker.\nNinja\nNinja should be strong single units that have a place on almost any team. Right now they’re not getting there, so we’re buffing their trait and some of the individual champions. Bonus Attack Damage and Ability Power: 40/60 ⇒ 50/70\nNoble\nNobles are still underperforming a bit as an end-game fantasy. We’ll likely need to make bigger changes to address this, but for now we’re giving them a small bump. Bonus Armor and Magic Resist: 60 ⇒ 70\nSorcerer\nThree piece Sorcerer is a just a little too strong due to its versatility. Bonus Ability Power: 45%/100% ⇒ 40%/100%\nWild\nWild is still underperforming, we’re giving it just a little bit more. Attack Speed: 10% per stack ⇒ 12% per stack\nTIER 1 CHAMPIONS Elise\nHealth: 450 ⇒ 500 Spiderling Attack Speed: 0.6 ⇒ 0.7\nKhazix\nNon-Isolated Damage: 150/300/450 ⇒ 150/250/350\nMordekaiser\nNo longer casts his ability if there are no enemies in range at the start of the cast time.\nNidalee\nNow always heals two units when she transforms. Previously she would only heal herself if she had the lowest health on your team.\nVayne\nAttack Speed: 0.75 ⇒ 0.7 Ability Damage (% of Max Health): 8%/10%/12% ⇒ 8%/12%/16%\nTIER 2 CHAMPIONS Braum\nHealth: 750 ⇒ 650\nLissandra\nTotal Mana (the mana required to cast her ability): 150 ⇒ 125\nLulu\nAbility Health: 300/475/650 ⇒ 300/400/500\nZed\nHealth: 500 ⇒ 550 Attack Speed: 0.65 ⇒ 0.7 Ability Damage: 200/300/400 ⇒ 200/350/500\nTIER 3 CHAMPIONS Aatrox\nNo longer casts his ability if there are no enemies in range at the start of the cast time.\nEvelynn\nNow prioritizes her current target with her ability. No longer casts her ability if there are no enemies in range at the start of the cast time.\nKatarina\nNo longer casts her ability if there are no enemies in range at the start of the cast time. Attack Damage: 50 ⇒ 65\nKennen\nNo longer casts his ability if there are no enemies in range at the start of the cast time.\nShyvana\nLeap AI improved to better kite away from her target.\nTIER 4 CHAMPIONS Akali\nAttack Damage: 70 ⇒ 80\nBrand\nAbility Damage: 200/375/550 ⇒ 250/450/650 Starting and Total Mana: 0/125 ⇒ 50/150\nCho’gath\nAbility Damage: 250/500/750 ⇒ 175/350/525\nTIER 5 CHAMPIONS Karthus\nStarting and Total Mana: 0/85 ⇒ 40/125\nKayle\nAttack Speed: 1.1 ⇒ 1.0\nMiss Fortune\nHealth: 650 ⇒ 700 Total Mana: 100 ⇒ 75\nITEMS Hush\nReworked: Now has a 33% chance on hit to prevent the enemy champion from gaining mana (we’re calling it Mana Lock) for four seconds.\nInfinity Edge\nCritical Strike Damage: 150% ⇒ 200%\nIonic Spark\nDamage: 150 ⇒ 125. Now properly stacks.\nLocket of the Iron Solari\nShield Duration: 4 seconds ⇒ 6 seconds\nMorellonomicon\nBurn Damage: 20% max health over 5 seconds ⇒ 20% max health over 10 seconds\nRed Buff\nBurn Damage: 13% max health over 5 seconds ⇒ 20% max health over 10 seconds\nRedemption\nHeal: 1000 health ⇒ 1500 health\nStatikk Shiv\nDamage and Bounces: 4 bounces, 90 damage per bounce ⇒ 3 bounces, 100 damage per bounce\nWarmog’s Armor\nHeal: Now heals a maximum of 400 health per tick. This mostly nerfs its effect on PVE dragons.\nGuardian Angel\nTooltip updated to reflect functionality (does not interrupt abilities or remove positive buffs). It now properly removes Grievous Wounds and resurrects properly. Health on resurrection: 800 ⇒ 500\nNew Drop Mechanic\nIn rare instances it’s now possible to drop a full completed item instead of the two components separately.\nBUGFIXES\nSpiderlings and Golem can now properly be the target of Frozen Heart, Kindred, Swain, Karthus, Shen, and Veigar. Graves now properly gains range with Rapidfire Cannon. Frozen Heart no longer applies too many slows when stacked. Fixed some item slots not showing up or being in weird spots. Fixed Win/Lose streak gold being granted after PvE Rounds instead of after the PvP Round that happened before (streak gold should be granted at the end of all PvP rounds and no PvE rounds). Fixed Little Legends having collision after dying (and subsequently body blocking players in the shared roulette). Fixed Blitzcrank attempting (and failing) at targeting untargetable enemies, and therefore not casting.

It now properly removes Grievous Wounds and resurrects properly. Health on resurrection: 800 ⇒ 500</p><p>New Drop Mechanic</p><p>In rare instances it&rsquo;s now possible to drop a full completed item instead of the two components separately.</p><p>BUGFIXES</p><p>Spiderlings and Golem can now properly be the target of Frozen Heart, Kindred, Swain, Karthus, Shen, and Veigar. Graves now properly gains range with Rapidfire Cannon. Frozen Heart no longer applies too many slows when stacked. Fixed some item slots not showing up or being in weird spots. Fixed Win/Lose streak gold being granted after PvE Rounds instead of after the PvP Round that happened before (streak gold should be granted at the end of all PvP rounds and no PvE rounds). Fixed Little Legends having collision after dying (and subsequently body blocking players in the shared roulette). Fixed Blitzcrank attempting (and failing) at targeting untargetable enemies, and therefore not casting.
