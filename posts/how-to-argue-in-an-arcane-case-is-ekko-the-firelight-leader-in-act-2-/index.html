Based on several clues, this introduction left many fans wondering: Are Arcanes masked Firelight Leader not only Ekko, but Arcanes a legend?\nIntro to Act 2 of the Arcane Act. In the first few scenes of episode 4, viewers are surprised at what many of the biggest actors are now. Heimerdinger is still 300, and has just been seen before. The character of Jayces has completely altered. Now, he’s the golden boy in Piltover, famous for his work in Hextech advancements. Caitlyn became an Armyman, while the show points out that Viktor, who is still working with Jayce, has grown more sick. Viewers can find the scene at the loading dock of a ship, where several hawks bringing a huge shipment of Shimmer into Piltover. Shimmer is the same purple liquid that was concocted in Act 1, and used to transform Deckard and Vander. The Firelights and the leader of the bombings travel to the island of Piltover, to destroy a large shipment of Silcos Shimmer. | Provided by Netflix.\nThe Firelight gang moves into The Piltover. When the shipment is received, a masked aas-screener crashes the party. The gang called The Firelights, and whose character is called the green cloak, is quickly gotten to work on the trapping of Silcos Goons and trying to destroy the shipment. The firelights have won, but the tide of the battle turns to rescue Silcos men by Jinx. The nickname Powder, now more cult-driven, is equipped with weapons and explosives. Jinx kills several of the Firelights — one who resembled Vi very closely and drives away the rest. The firelights reappear at the end of Episode 6 – the final episode of Act 2 – when Vi and Jinx reunited. The Firelight Leader is prominent all over the scene. The gang ultimately kidnaps Caitlyn and Vi and lifts a refined Hextech crystal that Jinx stole from Jayce. None of the firelights in the scene have their masks taken off. All of this raises the question: Who is exactly the firelight leader?\nAre Ekko the Firelight Leader in the Arcane Act 2? One of the things that stood out immediately when Act 2 of Arcane was that we saw the progression of every League of Legends champion in the first act, except one. The League champions we saw in Act 1 were Vi, Jinx, Ekko, Jayce, Caitlyn, Viktor, Heimerdinger and Singed. While the show talked to others, these champions were either mentioned directly or named in the subtitles (Singed). All those characters re-appeared in Act 2 except that of Ekko. We strongly believe that Ekko’s cause for us being blinded was the blazing mask of the firelight leader. There are several hints that will tie them down.\nAdditive 1: Ekko and the Firelight Leader are both fascinated with the clock and watches. In Arcane Act 2 on various occasions, the Firelight Leader took a sophisticated watch, including an interactive watch. When Ekko introduced a clock to the Arcane shop, he was working on a clock. In the League of Legends game, Ekko holds the title of The Boy Who Shattered Time. He loves clocks and can even manipulate time itself. In Act 2 we saw how the Firelight leader used a fine timepiece several times.\n2: Ekkos frog, scarlet, and pants. The Firelight Leader and the League of Legends champion Ekko wear a red scarf around their neck, green pants that wrap at the knees and use a bat as weapon. Providing by Netflix and Riot Games. Costume pieces are among the most obvious hints of Ekko’s relationship to the Firelight Leader. Both characters wear a red bandana as they scarf their necks. Both of them wear green pants that wrap their knees. And both characters use a bat as their weapon of choice. The biggest difference between the two characters is usually the white mask. This gives us our next hint.\nThe Firelight Leaders mask the masking. The younger Ekko had a peephole hidden in a mask in the Benzos store and used to spy on the Vander and Grayson in Act 1 | Provided by Netflix. The most noticeable thing about the Firelight Leader is the cracked white and gold mask worn throughout Act two. While it is impossible to tell who’s behind it, the mask itself could be a hint. I saw Ekko head up to an area under the Benzos store during Episode 1 of Act 1. He went on to spy on a conversation between vaner and Enforcer Grayson. Those that remember that scene might remember three masks Ekko had hidden in a peephole. The masks, despite their direct cover, look very similar to those worn by The Firelights. Moreover, official champions of Ekkos splash play (pictured above) depicts the character on a left knee wearing a mask. That mask looks pretty similar to the Firelight leader.\n4: The hoverboard is an icon. There is something Ekko doesn’t have that is a hoverboard in the League of Legends game. But that hasn’t prevented Ekko from being tied to hoverboards throughout the big Riot Games universe. Riot released the trailer for the Legends of Runeterra card game on YouTube. The short three-minute clip focuses on Runeterra and Zaun and aims to give a story of true genius to Ekko, which was built with a piece of Heimerdingers tech to build a prototype for a hoverboard eventually. To play Legends of Runeterra, one of the Ekkos followers is Shomi. Shomi can use a stick or a stick if the name didn’t give it away. The two characters are talking about the board as soon as they are interacting.\nNext, note 4: Ekko voice actor, Reed Shannon. But the biggest winner here is on the cast list. The credits on the 4 and 6 episodes show that the Firelight Leader is played by Reed Shannon. That was the only actor who played Ekko in the trailer from above. If that wasn’t enough, Shannon will voice Ekko in the upcoming Riot Forge and Double Stallion game, Conv/rgence, where he’s the principal character. Aside from all the above, and many other hints of the series such as Firelight preventing a Firelight member from killing Vi, or the gang stealing Hextech crystal that would create an Ekkos timewinder gear, we believe there is very high probability that the Firelight Leader will be revealed in the upcoming Act 3 of Arcane.\n","wordCount":"1085","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-28T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-28T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Samuel Pyle"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/how-to-argue-in-an-arcane-case-is-ekko-the-firelight-leader-in-act-2-/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>How To Argue In An Arcane Case Is Ekko The Firelight Leader In Act 2</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-28 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 28, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1085 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Samuel Pyle</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#intro-to-act-2-of-the-arcane-act>Intro to Act 2 of the Arcane Act.</a></li><li><a href=#the-firelight-gang-moves-into-the-piltover>The Firelight gang moves into The Piltover.</a></li><li><a href=#are-ekko-the-firelight-leader-in-the-arcane-act-2>Are Ekko the Firelight Leader in the Arcane Act 2?</a><ul><li><a href=#additive-1-ekko-and-the-firelight-leader-are-both-fascinated-with-the-clock-and-watches>Additive 1: Ekko and the Firelight Leader are both fascinated with the clock and watches.</a></li><li><a href=#2-ekkos-frog-scarlet-and-pants>2: Ekkos frog, scarlet, and pants.</a></li><li><a href=#the-firelight-leaders-mask-the-masking>The Firelight Leaders mask the masking.</a></li><li><a href=#4-the-hoverboard-is-an-icon>4: The hoverboard is an icon.</a></li><li><a href=#next-note-4-ekko-voice-actor-reed-shannon>Next, note 4: Ekko voice actor, Reed Shannon.</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>A new Zaunite gang called the Firelights is part of an early scene, whose direction is by a mysterious hoverboarder.
