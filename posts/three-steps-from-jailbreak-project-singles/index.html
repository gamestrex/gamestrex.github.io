Two months after earning his first Masters Degree at Undertow, Kevin The Doctor Ascate established himself one of the world’s best players. After finishing in second place at Blacklisted 6 he returned to the top of the podium with first place finish at Jailbreak. The Mario main slipped into the most competitive tournament; the entire event was rewarded with the elimination of the games at a single player. He successfully defeated the likes of Manny Dumshiny Carrillo, Joseph Qtip Hallowell and Eric Sneez Stanton on the way to the top eight. Though he lost his first game of the tournament, while the two finals were winner semis, he continued to beat Jonathan sosa after five matches in the team’s team. Finally, after having a finish, The Doctor had a 3-0 win over Kevin Blue Rosas Hope. He re-matched Sosa in the Grand Finals in another set, where Sosa pushed him to Game 5. While this is the case, The Doctor voted 3-2 in order to become the first person to win more than one major this year. God is very happy now. Kevin Ascate (The Doctor) (@The_Doctor) November 14, 2021\nBlue is a master of singles and doubles. Since the fall of the Doctor, Blue was one of the most active Project+ players in the past year, attending all four of the games majors up to that moment. In the process, the Link main proved a remarkably hard work in Doubles. He first took part in the four doubles brackets, even when he took the other partners a different part: Zachary Lunchables Sain at Undertow, Noah Nogh Sundook at Shipwrecked, The Doctor at Blacklisted 6 and Parker Boringman at Jailbreak. Blue has consistently achieved strong Singles results. Still none of his earlier shows was as impressive as his run at Jailbreak, where he finished third place. He swept many players like Boat and Brennan Bongo Avery, to win the prestigious quarter. There, he’s had to face his own teammate, Boringman. After five matches, Blue narrowly defeated Boringman 3-2 to progress into the semis. Next, he defeated Cloudburst in a second set that went to Game 5 in the finals of the competition. While he faltered both against The Doctor and Sosa, Blue proved to be a powerful force in any Project+ format. 4 majors. 4 partners.4. First place finishes in doubles.This doesn’t feel real. Kevin Rosas Hope (@ssbBlue) November 13, 2021.\nFearless throughs a difficult losers bracket, so as to qualify for the Project M Theatre. Shahid Fearless Jivani became the Top 32 on the winners side after three games, with the win against PotatoesAreYum De Dios Ganondorf. Yet, he dropped his first set of top 32 to Cloudburst, 3-1, which forced him into the losers’ bracket fairly early. With fearless, he ran across a deep losers bracket. Using a solid note, he eliminated a boat 3-0 and a boat thirtieth tyrante 3-1. Before becoming top eight, the No. 7 seed Fearless had to defeat the no. 8 seed Sneez. The set has gone the distance as expected, a light of the proximity of their seedlings. Fearless secured a 3-2 victory over Sneez to enter the top eight. The first scare of the attack of Jailbreak became a top eight victory. He beat No. 5, Peter Pikmon Woodworth in a fifth in the second group. Afterward, he had to rematch Cloudburst, the player that sent him to the losers bracket in the first place. Fearless reversed his original score, beating Cloudburst 3-1 to progress into the top four. Despite losing his next set to Sosa, Fearless notably made it far enough to enter Project M, a new Smash Summit inviteal for Project+. Wooo! Congrats to @ssbBlue and @Fearless on the auditions at Jailbreak! Welcome to the videoclips. I’ll have to visit you in March. heartswapTV (@heartswaptv) November 14, 2021.\nLooking ahead Blue and Fearless qualified for the Project M Theatre as the two most-placing, non-invited players at Jailbreak. The next two qualifier spots will be up for grabs at McSmashter in Ontario, Canada, in February 2022.\n","wordCount":"699","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-24T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-24T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bryan Robertson"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/three-steps-from-jailbreak-project-singles/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Three Steps From Jailbreak Project Singles</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 24, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;699 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Bryan Robertson</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#the-doctor-also-takes-part-in-a-major-change-in-the-phds-jailbreak>The doctor also takes part in a major change in the phd’s Jailbreak.</a></li><li><a href=#blue-is-a-master-of-singles-and-doubles>Blue is a master of singles and doubles.</a></li><li><a href=#fearless-throughs-a-difficult-losers-bracket-so-as-to-qualify-for-the-project-m-theatre>Fearless throughs a difficult losers bracket, so as to qualify for the Project M Theatre.</a></li><li><a href=#looking-ahead>Looking ahead</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>There are all the most important entries from the tournament.</p><h2 id=the-doctor-also-takes-part-in-a-major-change-in-the-phds-jailbreak>The doctor also takes part in a major change in the phd’s Jailbreak.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-doctor-also-takes-part-in-a-major-change-in-the-phds-jailbreak>#</a></h2><p>Two months after earning his first Masters Degree at Undertow, Kevin The Doctor Ascate established himself one of the world’s best players.
