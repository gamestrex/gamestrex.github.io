Agents here are masters of different special abilities or skills, which makes gameplay more amusing and appealing.\nDC Heroes \u0026 Villains DC Heroes \u0026 Villains is a casual RPG. You can collect and play iconic DC characters like Batman, Harley Quinn, Superman, Lex Luther, and more. A mysterious event has taken all your powers and you, with a team of heroes and anti-heroes, are on a mission to recover them.\nFinal Fantasy VII Ever Crisis Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis is a single-player RPG. It will be part of the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. It is a free-to-play game with an active time battle system and loot boxes. The game is created by Applibot and is expected to be beta-released in the summer.\nAntariksha Sanchar Antariksha Sanchar is a point-and-click adventure game.
