especially when the difficulty curve starts to really ramp up.\rAnd with the addition of two new quest types, you may be wondering how if and how they matter - which is where this Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak walkthrough and guide comes in.\nMonster Hunter Rise Sunbreak walkthrough Sunbreak follows in the footsteps of Monster Hunter World’s Iceborne expansion - something that helped simplify the franchise’s story structure, making it something much easier for new players to jump into and follow. Getting through the Sunbreak DLC is the most straightforward Monster Hunter questline yet. Everything is linked to ‘Key Quests’ in your highest level of Master Rank (MR) quests, and any Urgent Quests you’re asked to look into as you progress.\rLike the base game, Rise, your Key Quests are shown by a red diamond to the left of the quest name when talking to the quest giver. In Sunbreak, this can either be Minoto in the Gathering Hub, or the new character Chichae in Elgado.\rThis straightforward design makes blasting through MR quicker and easier than ever. When trying to advance to the next rank, you can pick any Key Quest that still has a red diamond to the left and no tick mark to the right. This means you can either pick the easy option and fight the weakest monster, or you can go for the one you think will give you the loot you need to level up your weapons and armour. The choice is all yours. As always, it’s useful to know what quests and their respective monsters are coming up. The further you progress, the more materials are available to you, and if you know your favourite monster is just an area away, you know exactly when to take an hour out of the story to start farming.\rIf you don’t prefer the below format, we also have a dedicated monsters list of what is in the expansion and when it unlocks. Note you need to have played your way through a number of missions in the base game to start Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak, which then allows you to unlock Master Rank as well as Sunbreak’s missions.\nHow to unlock MR1 Simply put, do the first mission of the Sunbreak DLC:\nUninvited Guest - Hunt a Daimyo Hermataur\nMR1 story quests From here, you will need to do a set number of Key Quests to unlock an Urgent Quest and level up. At this point, the easiest are:\nA Sinking Feeling - Slay a total of 15 Hermataur or Velocipray Need a Hunter ASAP! - Hunt a Kula-Ya-Ku\nHowever, you can also do the following if you’re feeling brave:\nYou Had Me at Poofy - Hunt a Royal Ludroth Catnap Ruined - Hunt 2 Arzuros\nTip: Do ‘A Sinking Feeling’ and then get the Velocipray armour if you like catching large monsters. The defense boost is great, and the Capture Master ability gives you a ‘High chance of increased capture rewards’, and we all know that the chance to get additional rare items for basically nothing is excellent. You’ll also get the option to craft the super-powerful Power Talon and Defence Talon items, so make sure you do so!\nDo the Urgent Quest:\nTetrandon Blockade - Hunt a Tetrandon\nDo two more Key Quests (any of the following):\nIt Could be Worse… - Hunt an Aknosom The Red Rolling Terror - Hunt a Volvidon Barroth to a Great Start - Hunt a Barroth [Redacted] - Hunt 2 Great Wroggi BRRRR Plus ZZZzzz Equals? - Hunt a Lagombi and a Great Baggi\nDo another Urgent Quest:\nScarlet Tengu in the Shrine Ruins / The Assault of the Scarlet Tengu - Hunt a Blood Orange Bishaten\nTip: It’s like the normal one, but with fire-breathing and firey pinecones instead of fruit. Fun.\nCongratulations, you’ve just unlocked Master Rank 2! In doing so you’ve also unlocked Follower Quests and Support Surveys. While these aren’t necessary to progress within the game, they are a fun addition that really fleshes out the world of Elgado, and are recommended should you need to farm items and don’t want to simply replay the same old quests!\nMR2 story quests Do two Key Quests from the following:\nThe Queen’s Garden - Hunt a Rathian The Alabaster Devourer - Hunt a Khezu Somnacanth Sleep Aid - Hunt a Somnacanth Poison Drops in the Sand - Hunt a Pukei-Pukei Bird Wyvern Jamboree - Hunt an Aknosom and a Kula-Ya-Ku\nDo the Urgent Quest:\nProvoking an Anjanath’s Wrath - Hunt an Anjanath\nThis adds the researcher Bahari to your list of known characters. He’s found Garangolm tracks - the first of the Three Lords.\rDo two more Key Quests:\nRumble in the Jungle - Hunt a Tobi Kadachi Pent-Up Frustrations - Hunt a Basarios Messed Up Situation - Hunt a Jyuratodus Shrine Ruined - Hunt a Great Izuchi and a Rathian Now That’s What I Call Great! - Hunt all target monsters (Great Izuchi, Great Wroggi and Great Baggi\nDo the Urgent Quest:\nA Rocky Rampage / Ganagolm Gone Mad - Hunt a Garangolm\nThis mission unlocks the Citadel, where Dame Fiorayne joins you on the hunt.\rBeating the mission unlocks MR3 and Bahari in Elgado. Congratulations! Learn how to start Sunbreak - the first expansion - and from there, how to unlock Master Rank, use Switch Skill swap, and progress onward with our Monster Hunter Sunbreak walkthrough.\rThere’s also a monsters list, as well as individual pages on beating Garangolm, Lunagaron and Shogun Ceanataur.\rFor the base game, we have a number of Monster Hunter Rise tips and lists of ore locations, bone locations, weapon types, how to use Insect Glaives and Kinsects, details of how to join friends in multiplayer, how to capture monsters and learn about wirebugs and great wirebugs.\nMR3 story quests Do three Key Quests:\nTrial of the Almudron - Hunt an Almudron My Ceanataur Gently Weeps - Hunt a Shogun Ceanataur White Knight on Ice - Hunt a Bartioth Oh, My Garsh Harag - Hunt a Goss Harag Nocturnal Nuisances - Hunt an Anjanath and a Tobi Kadachi\nDo the Urgent Quest:\nKeep it Busy - Hunt an Aurora Somnacanth\nLike a normal MR Somnacanth, but it’s an ice-type variant. Instead of sleep-breath it uses ice-breath. When you see it get ready for an AOE attack, run because it will ignite the icy mist it exudes. Other than that, pack a few Nulberries to get rid of the ice-blight and rapidly thaw your Silkbugs!\rCongratulations - you’re now asked to do a few more Key Quests while Bahari analyses what is clearly a vampire bat. Specifically three more Key Quests from the following:\nShadow in the Jungle - Hunt a Nargacuga A Sandy Spider Nest - Hunt a Rakna-Kadaki Purging Hatred - Hunt a Magnamalo A Tale of Two Titans - Hunt a Garangolm and a Somnacanth Rock, Razor, Pincers - Hunt a Daimyo Hermataur and a Shogun Ceanataur\nDo the Urgent Quest:\nIce Wolf, Red Moon / Howling Moon - Hunt a Lunagaron\nCongratulations for real this time - you’ve just hit MR4!\nMR4 story quests Do two Key Quests:\nA Mizutsune’s Appeal - Hunt a Mizutsune Dust Devil Despot - Hunt a Diablos King of the Crumbling Castle - Hunt a Rathalos Pincers Versus Pyro - Hunt a Shogun Ceanataur and a Rathian\nDo the Urgent Quest:\nIn Search of the Doctor - Hunt an Astalos\nThis is where you meet Doctor Tadori, a doctor for your base, Elgado. Time for more Key Quests - two, in fact:\nSacrilegious Thunder Wolf - Hunt a Zinogre A Thousand Scales of Dread - Hunt a Seregios Hot Mud in Your Eye - Hunt a Magma Almudrun White Knight, Armored Warrior - Hunt a Barioth and a Magnamalo\nDo the Urgent Quest:\nA Slumbering Jungle Espinas - Hunt an Espinas\nWe’re still in MR4, which means more Key Quests. Do any two of the following:\nDark Wings, Dark Work - Hunt a Gore Magala Absolute Power - Hunt a Tigrex A Mighty Need - Hunt a Pyre Rakna-Kadaki Spooky Citadel!? - Hunt a Garangolm and a Lunagaron\nDo the Urgent Quest (finally):\nWitness by Moonlight / Crimson Moonlight - Slay Malzeno\nCongratulations! You’ve taken down the big bad, Malzeno, and unlocked MR5.\nMR5 story quests First, do two Key Quests:\nSettle the Score! - Hunt a Rajang Bazelgeuse Warning - Hunt a Bazelgeuse Evil Forest - Hunt a Lunagaron and a Zinogre Blade in the Darkness - Hunt a Gore Magala and a Seregios\nDo the Urgent Quest:\nDark Citadel, White Wheel - Slay a Shagaru Magala\nTime for more Key Quests - nothing major, except that all of your options are now Elder Dragons… so, good luck! Any of two of the following:\nLeave No Trace Behind - Slay a Chameleos The Frozen Dictator - Slay a Kushala Daora Burn Brighter than the Sun - Slay a Teostra\nTime for an Urgent Quest:\nGathering of the Qurio - Hunt a Lunagaron\nTip: This one is a little creepy in that there’s no endemic life or small monsters. It’s just an epic battle against Lunagaron. If you rely on Spiribugs for stamina, maybe pack a few well-done steaks. After you’ve collected your items, an epic cutscene follows. You won’t want to miss it, so put your headphones on and enjoy.\rYou’ve now met Gaismagorm, the Archdemon of the Abyss. Slay it to get to HR6. Do the Urgent Quest:\nProof of Courage / The Devil’s Reincarnation - Slay Gaismagorm\nWell done, you’ve taken down the real big bad. You’ve also unlocked MR6, the Master Rank cap and the end credits. Congratulations! From here,the first Urgent Quest unlocks at MR10, with a couple more additional monsters to unlock beyond that - so go out there and get hunting!\n","wordCount":"1694","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-30T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-30T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"John Grosbier"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-walkthrough-and-guide-for-story-quests-in-order/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak Walkthrough And Guide For Story Quests In Order</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 30, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1694 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;John Grosbier</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-walkthrough>Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak walkthrough</a><ul><li><a href=#how-to-unlock-mr1>How to unlock MR1</a></li><li><a href=#mr1-story-quests>MR1 story quests</a></li><li><a href=#mr2-story-quests>MR2 story quests</a></li><li><a href=#mr3-story-quests>MR3 story quests</a></li><li><a href=#mr4-story-quests>MR4 story quests</a></li><li><a href=#mr5-story-quests>MR5 story quests</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Each game and expansion takes this incredibly deep pool of monsters and makes it that little bit deeper - and Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak is no exception.

You’ve taken down the big bad, Malzeno, and unlocked MR5.</p><h3 id=mr5-story-quests>MR5 story quests<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#mr5-story-quests>#</a></h3><p>First, do two Key Quests:</p><p>Settle the Score! - Hunt a Rajang Bazelgeuse Warning - Hunt a Bazelgeuse Evil Forest - Hunt a Lunagaron and a Zinogre Blade in the Darkness - Hunt a Gore Magala and a Seregios</p><p>Do the Urgent Quest:</p><p>Dark Citadel, White Wheel - Slay a Shagaru Magala</p><p>Time for more Key Quests - nothing major, except that all of your options are now Elder Dragons&mldr; so, good luck! Any of two of the following:</p><p>Leave No Trace Behind - Slay a Chameleos The Frozen Dictator - Slay a Kushala Daora Burn Brighter than the Sun - Slay a Teostra</p><p>Time for an Urgent Quest:</p><p>Gathering of the Qurio - Hunt a Lunagaron</p><p>Tip: This one is a little creepy in that there’s no endemic life or small monsters. It’s just an epic battle against Lunagaron. If you rely on Spiribugs for stamina, maybe pack a few well-done steaks.
After you’ve collected your items, an epic cutscene follows. You won’t want to miss it, so put your headphones on and enjoy.
You’ve now met Gaismagorm, the Archdemon of the Abyss. Slay it to get to HR6.
Do the Urgent Quest:</p><p>Proof of Courage / The Devil’s Reincarnation - Slay Gaismagorm</p><p>Well done, you’ve taken down the real big bad. You’ve also unlocked MR6, the Master Rank cap and the end credits.
Congratulations!
From here,the first Urgent Quest unlocks at MR10, with a couple more additional monsters to unlock beyond that - so go out there and get hunting!</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/monster_hunter_rise_sunbreak_key_quest.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/75/monster_hunter_rise_sunbreak_key_quest.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhe7F7TRXHtjiKvHb5vS7DmnxvpHiDyoYyYvm1nHB3Qp2_w3BnM6A2eq4v7FYxCC9bfZt3a9vIMtAYEKUiaDQbHMg-ViyGmRIj39MLp0bGFfgfYw1Dc9q_H-T0wiTm3l0Uq42dETrN9eC8aGJ9_IORZsxST1AcLR7np1koOfcc7tnHa4S8Mwz_xD9d0=s16000"' alt="Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak walkthrough and guide for story quests in order -
