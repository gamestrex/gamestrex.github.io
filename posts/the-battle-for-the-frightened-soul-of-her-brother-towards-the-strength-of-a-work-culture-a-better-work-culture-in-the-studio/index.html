Many of its current and former employees felt their experiences at the company from 2011 and from 2011 to 2014 marked the end of an intense clash with their self-portrait. While some praised the news, many others found a way of hiring a D\u0026I director of many employees to leave mandatory arbitration was a little too late, in fact a lot. For the other rest, a long journey to a better future, but a roadblock continued, with more and more to come. IGN spoke with 26 current and former employees that worked at Bungie in the last decade. Their accounts of the studio’s work culture encompass a wide range of experiences. They span overt sexism, boys’ club culture, crunch, and human rights protection for abusers, and more complex stories of abusers, systemic inequalities, and difficult ways of being heard. Yet even the interviewees are a number of those who, despite their own hurts, truly believe the studio is slowly but steadily improving, have candid candid stories about the huge challenge of trying to turn such a massive ship in a better direction, and who claim what’s been told at IGN with Parsons in response to this piece, is all clear and concise. Each source we interviewed joined Bungie because they wanted to play games they liked. But they all had to have a question, the one that a massive AAA gaming company with 800 more employees can solve the problem, and become a trumpful and fun place for their jobs? There is seemingly no better microcosm for Bungie’s historical, company-wide cultural troubles than its narrative team, which experienced a toxic leadership, issues with crunch, and sometimes impossible separation between Old and New Bungie culture, and more all within the five or six years. We spoke with a group of people who were close to or if in the narrative team, and painted a picture of the highly divided group of people who originated from Destiny one, where their problems originated from the moment it was done. Several sources spoke of a narrative team lead from time to time who seemed to be burnt out during the project, creating a toxic work environment for others on the team. Fortunately, team members kept a countdown of days since his last “explosion” on the whiteboard. Many people I spoke to knew that he was throwing a chair at the window because others were ruining his creative vision of the game. He stayed at the studio several years, then was then forced to quit and then asked to go back to contract work for Destiny 2. Some sources who witnessed him during that time said he would often issue narrative direction without being a senior team member, and become angry when he felt the Destiny 2 writers were deviating from the original vision for Destiny 1. One source told a story when he shouted at her over the phone so aggressively that she could’ve felt tears, and she refused to speak with him without a third party present. This lead was not the only team member who was affected by the burnout in Destiny one and after a big number of trips left, Bungie created a new team for Destiny 2, which was more often found in white and male teams than many other teams. In fact, a series of white men started their life in a run by which they made many of our sources miserable for years. Most of the people we spoke to were reluctant to say they were mentioned in such a magazine, without any other words, fearing repercussions either on themselves or on others who had vehemently complained about perpetrators in the past. The writer couldn’t learn about their work without making a recording of the voice. When people objected, he told them they needed thicker skins. Many of our sources also wanted to remain anonymous to avoid reprisal or harm to their careers, but a former employee was willing to be named: Cookie Hiponia, a color-dignite who was responsible for the team’s anger. Many of our sources saw the plight of a narrative team from outside, but Hiponia was flooded with the elements. She started working as a copy editor at Bungie, then a full-time employee until 2019. Hiponia remembered that when she was first in her seat, Bungie didn’t have big editing oversight in the Destiny franchise and had not focused much on it, its consistency, or continuity. This led to the idea that a leader can’t speak of normal-extended professional boundaries. Just like hiponia says, “They have bunch of people who wrote things and were a sort of deaf.” One of our anonymous sources described one leader from earlier this year as a sexist nightmare in which yelled in meetings and waved the paper over tables. Numerous people told us he frequently planned to repeat the last minute of the night, often on his way to voice recording sessions. Writers won’t learn their work’s changes until the recording of a voice-smart has been done. When people objected to her demeanor, he told them they needed thicker skins and learned how to criticize. He called the two women on the team an “unmanageable bitch.” A second source said that he was “literally the worst person I’ve ever worked for.” He was let go, but was replaced by antagonizing men – which our sources said were similarly. A leading frequently made sexist comments, but also complained about the reverse sexism, and at least one occasion made homophobic remarks to a deaf-looking colleague. He would mock his team members openly in meetings, then play off his mockery as a joke and often take credit for work other than that. Hiponia recalls a moment when said lead attempted to give the subject to a relatively new employee a post-secondary note to the top Bungie leadership when asked if the truth is true, “What are you doing anyway?” When Hiponia confronted him about his task later and asked him why he was given away, he said that he just was joking around. One anonymous source named the third narrative lead a “clause, hierarchical, authoritarian, incurious, cruel leader” for a story. Hiponia said she frequently asked her to do administrative and secretariat tasks like taking notes or checking up information. However, she’d manage her work as a writer and a manager of the team. Others recalled that he frequently insulted people who stood up for themselves, including letting off the narrative team after they agreed on a last-minute request and asked for such an emergency to happen again. He walked away and robbed a worker who stood up for him to tell them about him. Many sources say she regularly made racist remarks, such as a lunch where one source recalled she was putting up a number of inappropriate comments about Latin American gangs. The narrative team worked a minimum of 60, 70, 80, and even 100-hour weeks during some expansions. Most people did not break between short periods. Even with only its turbulent senior members, the narrative team continued to be in chaos for a long time for Destiny 2, and a few of its second expansions, having to ship content new to the public. As such, there was high turnover and burnout. Hiponia recalls the ongoing struggle to hire a full-time narrative contractor to help ease the team’s burden. Even though the department was overwhelmed, it remained skeptical to call for new full-time staff, and often contracts aren’t renewed or extended in time, resulting in months-long periods where the department was left out of the department’s poor space. Those closest to this team describe their employees working 60, 70, 80, even 100 hour weeks during expansions, often without breaks between the crunch periods. The crew member was crunched as they were sick and couldn’t type so they had to take a break for them a while. Another source said that the team was told not to crunch in support of a growing studio push to eliminate the practice. Though the idea was that the studio would simply cut features if crunch was the only way to get them done. But many of the writers feel they’ve been backed up after the painful release of the first release of Destiny 2’s DMLC, Curse of Osiris. The story of Osiris was under fire on Reddit – with many female narrative team members being exonerated for harassment, death threats and vitriol. Our sources say that women didn’t get support in the studio or from the community team for what they were going through, and multiple sources heard that a member of leadership still at the studio who emailed Reddit comments about these women to other company leaders in a bid to take off the narrative team because players didn’t like the story. The same leader said that when he was dismissed about the controversy, she said that no one should be worried because they didn’t just bring back the Writers’ assignment to solve it everything. In fact, many people familiar with the team’s writing story that had a low reception in the studio after being treated poorly by other departments, were wrongly disappointed when the game was received by. One member of the committee mailed Reddit comments about women to other company leaders in a seemingly false bid to nudge the narrative team because players didn’t like the story. As a result, the narrative team was afraid of what would happen if something else of the community wasn’t as accurate as it was. They stopped working so they would hide overtime from their leads so they wouldn’t enforce the story cuts. Unforgivated when there was no need to change and to change the last minute; often worsening, and often frustrated when conflicted over who was taking control of the story’s control. Aside from the different talents and groups of the studio, the creative direction was fraught. Some of Bungie’s old guard had an eye on the vision of Destiny 1 and reluctant to change all of the tone, characterizations or direction of the story as the game passed into Destiny 2. This was especially frustrating for the team in cases where that vision never existed explicitly in the game, but only existed in the minds of people that no longer worked in narrative. A second issue was the development of the cinematic which were considered a prestige project. Largely written in the “star chamber,” the cinematics team often tried to operate without interruption compared to the main story crew – resulting in disconnects between established lore, planned quests, and major story beats. The cinematic teams rewrite a little more with Hiponia, while the movie theater would be used to making a film, such as it was recalled by others. The clashes with those different interests caused even further problems. Underrepresented writers and allies on the team tried to do something more inclusive and thoughtful in his portrayals. Those who knew the writing team knew that many scenarios were where the students would not realize what they were doing to portray women in ways that were, with their attention or rather, sexist or degrading. The non-label writers, both women and allies, would push back, fighting for a kind of hopeful and compelling story with Destiny’s women that they were often told in its male characters. Since they have seen many successes in this regard over the years, it was also often very hard and painful for those who bring these issues in to hear, sometimes without the assistance of some sympathetic individuals who, inside the team, have been brought in. There were some sources telling stories of male narrative leads at the studio who pushed forward stories for characters such as Eris Morn, Mara Sov, Ana Bray, Ikora Rey, Suraya Hawthorne and others that leaned on harmful stereotypes of women and mental health issues, often despite objections from women and supportive allies across the studio. “I could be able to go on a long time after all the ways women have been made to stand by, the men on the team have written characters in baffling, unrecognizable ways,” said the source familiar with the matter. Another example of a time when no one was listening to the diverse members of the writing team is the case of Devrim Kay, a scout player meeting at the European Dead Zone location who gives missions and talks about his love of food and tea. At the moment of Destiny 2’s development, a member of the writing team added a small piece of dialogue for Devrim, referring to missing his “partner.” It was a single, small line among many other lines, meant to be said both by Devrim and many others, but to comment about their relationships, thoughts and feelings, on similar situations. The line was taken over by multiple artists and checks and put into the game’s build as an ear before the whole team noticed it and demanded that it be taken out or the game would be unavailable in Russia or China if they didn’t stop reshaping it because it was a gay romance. “At the time of a long time, I could talk about all the ways women have been able to stand by, with men on the team having written characters in dark, unrecognizable ways.” I was surprised by the error when an QA tester called it a bleed-at-all – and explained it was in response. Eventually, the line was changed so that Devrim could simply talk about someone named “Marc” without an reference to it. This made it into the final game, and Bungie got praised for joining a gay character, especially as Devrim’s voice actor confirmed that they had close relationship with the media shortly after, without any explanation of the concern for the cause of the incident in the studio. Several sources remember their anger and anger: Bungie’s writers tried to promote their story by making them more inclusive with Destiny’s first canon gay relationship, Bungie leadership had tried to stop it, but was quickly influenced by it anyway. In all of these situations, members of the writing team who fought for change, were routinely told they were difficult to work with, unsupported enough of their leaders, or were aggressive or abrasive and needed to take criticism better. These criticisms were often used to answer the question of why the team asked a candidate for promotion after each new challenge, where several people were turned down repeatedly. Hiponia had specific conviction that she was unkind at the game, because she wasn’t good enough with her core narrative functions, despite being a conjecture for gameplay. But when she asked for time on work to play and improve, she offered to delve into a particular task. She also said her own stress levels skyrocketed while she was at Bungie, enhancing her appetite for anti-anxiety medication, and even reducing her blood pressure, leading to stress related gastrointestinal problems that require surgery. Hiponia was not the alone source but other generations whose colleagues got stressed and broken by the time it came to an ecstasy-related issues that mattered more. In 2018, the situation became unsolvable. It was a terrible attempt to reach their true compromise with the employees, but when they tried to work out more hard, they also were told that the people who’ve been making their lives miserable every day, but that team realized that the leads didn’t make any efforts to construct the same bridges on their end. Many wrote the CEO, Pete Parsons, begging for help. They never heard back. It wasn’t until multiple writers quit or threatened to quit, in addition to every woman on the narrative team that Bungie finally dismissed the leads responsible for the chaos and began to take the teams concerns more seriously. Those connected to the narrative team today say that things have improved, more funding and more staff to share the load, and new leads, specifically tasked with helping the department recover. But it finally took the sacrifice of many people’s careers and mental and emotional health to get it there. It seems to be the best example, but narrative isn’t the only thing in the department to have suffered this way. In fact, our sources pointed out that nearly every major company is involved with problems. Some said that the hypocrisy that explains how well Bungie works, is what he says:’Teams are stronger than heroes’ “It is necessary for us, to act in mutual respect, inclusivity, and support”, says the company statement. “We want to know that teams whose members speak their mind and take risks will do what no individual ever can.” Our wins are always teams wins.” When we spoke to the people you talked, that translated to something of a horde of inequality inside, namely Bungie, which doesn’t tolerate disassholes. While he says that about leadership, including Parsons, Bungie doesn’t deal with the type of “rockstar” culture that, in other companies, has turned the subject into problematic, populous individuals and their misjudgmenting. All of them feel like having to humiliate others; whether that being harassment, toxicity or other forms of abuse. But many of our sources say this company was simply not true until very recently. Fast everyone we spoke with had at least one, or even more long-time friends in Bungie, who seemed to be able to find nothing, protected either by their leaders or long-serving HR personnel. “When I read the story of the Activision-Blizzard, I laughed.” “This isn’t my experience there.” They have the core value that they don’t tolerate assholes even if they’re rockstars but they do totally. What is all that’s aspirational. Those values are the values they want to attain, but they aren’t making them stronger.” The stories of Bungie’s problematic rockstars back to his success as the creator of Halo. Some names only popped up once or twice the time we heard a single word, over multiple departments and many years of Bungie history. They have that core value that they don’t tolerate assholes even if they are rockstars, but they totally do it. They are what they want to achieve, but they’re not enforcing them. One top-level company leader, who had worked with Bungie since Halo was described as an “asshole” by sources, had an attitude to denial of those who brought up the company’s toxic culture, didn’t bother to learn anyone’s name, and whose inappropriate work wardrobe included a shirt with free lap rides. He was seen, too, being particularly drunk in company events, and would take his toenails on the desk. Having stood up to the company’s highest standards, the person eventually departed without a kiss. An ambiguous company email, after which he received his departure, described the company’s zero tolerance policy for bad actors and offered assistance for employees for their health. The different person mentioned by many sources had always been in Bungie since Halo 3, eventually becoming a director-level role throughout Destiny Games. Sources described him to be excessively affluent to his team, with some noted that his team seemed more late nights than others. One described her as “just torturing” her staff, while another described a multiple instance of racism and racism. A source close to his team described numerous instances of him bullying employees during one-on-one meetings and viciously berating his team when work didn’t meet his standards. The stories shared here are far from the only examples where we heard a number of similar cases of behavior, not just from Bungie leaders, but also from other employees across multiple departments who often had their superiors as reason for themselves to accept their dislikes, who wouldn’t judge bad behaviour or complain against those they favored. Most of these cases, sources felt their stories are too specific to share with this piece without personally acknowledging themselves and risking retaliation or violating a non-disparagement agreement to many former employees we spoke to say they felt pressured to sign upon leaving the company. Their fears aren’t unfounded. You can tell a lot about this person in almost every story you heard, sources say. A lot of reports were made to HR and leadership about these people, but without a word of mouth. Unfortunately, the number of HRs who seem to be unwilling to help those who complain about toxic team leaders is a long recurring theme of our interviews. Some felt their reports were ignored entirely; others told us they had been brought into meetings to unexpectedly find the person they had reported sitting in the room to discuss the issues. There was at least one long-standing Bungie worker in HR, and still with the company, who nearly all of our sources described as actively protecting harmful individuals. Several people said their job seemed to be “to do everything,” but whenever somebody was irritated with the company. One person recalled them extremely insulting to diverse employees behind their backs and being “catty” toward women about their clothes and clothing, a woman calls for a “slut”. You’re putting your own job on the line. “It’s a well-known fact that when you talk to HR, you are taking the right course. This individual, with numerous other negative encounters over the years with other HR representatives, created a nearly universal mistrust in HR from almost everyone we were speaking to. Many of them noted they struggled to trust HR anywhere as a general rule. That is much better than a business with a team of members, but for many that were trained differently. To say the truth, if you speak with HR, you can put on the line! “Responsible employees’ experience has never been compromised. They had been there to protect the company. I’ve watched that happen many times in Bungie, where someone went to HR and things went completely sideways for them. No matter what the obvious matter is to have many people in power at Bungie, who were known as toxic, sexist, or otherwise problematic, their behaviour and beliefs across the years permeated the company’s culture in far more obvious ways. That is why, even when it comes to deciding what kind of person would use the same power and creative influence with each other. Women particularly have struggled at Bungie over the years. As many women as I talked about, people encountered a difficult environment and developed a sexy atmosphere. Multiple sources said women were disproportionately talked over in meetings, their ability to do their jobs questioned, or their ideas ignored and then used by men who later took credit for them, or simply ignored the questions or comments of women, or merely dismissed issues that also seem to have impacted people of color at the studio of all genders, though women of color were particularly impacted. A woman recalled numerous meetings where she’d give feedback or ask a question, and no one had ever heard him say: “I was totally invisible.” “A lot of women were put on what I would call unappealing projects that had ended up having major crunch issues, maybe even potentially quality issues, things that were not even funded very well,” said another source. The only thing that would succeed wasn’t that much. One woman pointed to these and similar scenarios as clear examples of why Bungie has historically had so few women in leadership. She said, sometimes people of the top were friends with the Bungie topmen, then who was friends with them, and who became friends in the group. And, because it was from the beginning, it was white men. So historically it tended to stay. Another source noted that men at Bungie have “code names” for women in the studio they found attractive, which they would often use in the studio without women knowing. Some of these names were references to their physical form, hair color or unambiguous terms. “a lot of women…were engaged in what I said would be unappealing projects.Things that won’t succeed in a way that would allow them to shine in a review period.” People often mention an artist for sexist remarks and encouraging his colleagues to discuss his love life on Tinder. This producer was reported to have “skyrocketed” through the ranks at Bungie, and was very charismatic and well-liked enough for Bungie’s old guard so that the reports that he had made about his behavior seemed to be misjudged. Although he was eventually fired, one former employee recalls several colleagues discussing his departure shortly after he left for work. “Before a good man who got beaten up by political correctness”, suggesting women who were reported only to get a sense of humor. Many sources repeatedly harassed his female direct reports with sexual comments and unwanted hugs, while simultaneously belitting them and closing them in meetings. The women eventually imposed a sign at their desks encouraging both them to stay in their personal space. Another source recalls that the same woman wrote a report to his female direct report that the only reason she had her job was because she was a woman. This manager was eventually thrown out of control. However, it took a few years for this to happen. There were different battles between the groups underrepresented. Several stories recounted conversations about managers and lead making racist remarks or even using slurs to refer to more diverse Destiny characters or, at least, that individual at the studio. Several employees also saw discrimination against transgender individuals at the studio, including questions about their restrooms, their use of correct words, and other inappropriate questions. Between 2016 and 2018, Hiponia formed an internal diversity committee that formed the year before. The committee was a unified group that, because company limitations on allocated hours for meetings and lack of practical support for such groups, must not only meet during lunch breaks rather than working time. About half of the initial committee was made up of diverse members from different departments who were there to push for change. But, the other half was composed of all white men, who, from hiponia and other sources say, put roadblocks in at every turn. All the pushes to introduce a gender-neutral bathroom to the company, to support the Black Lives Matter movement and to complete a survey that would rate Bungie on its LGBTQ+ equality and inclusion were rejected either. Hiponia and other diverse members joined the committee in 2018 — and began to quit it in 2018. As the committee bled members, Bungie decided it was totally ineffective and shut down it. Another group who faced tough challenges at Bungie were those who were able to handle physical or mental health issues. While the benefits of Bungie’s business were praised by many of us, many people also mentioned the problem or knowing people who had been at the center of a mental or physical health problem for whom Bungie was not only uneasy, but even hostile. Since the incident made it easier for one person to take more time to handle these issues during the period of hardship, a substitute for a substitute for a replacement of medication from a previous surgery. All of these things whose problems are measurable, are not simply a problem, but actually because you don’t have any scold, so you have never heard anything racist. The family who suffered from death was penalized in a review period because they were abrasive and uncommunicative, though their manager knew the context. Multiple sources knew that autism patients struggled with negative feedback without concrete advice on the way to improve communication. Still two others describe situations where they took time off to deal with either personal or familial health issues, but returned and resurfaced as if they were punished for abandoning a less desirable project. Various people we talked to, all who were not with the company, described high level of anxiety caused by their work at Bungie, while others attribute it to an inconsistency at all to a studio’s claims to the contrary across departments like QA, localization, audio, narrative and others and references abusive managers. Many said they became depressed, eventually having to increase their treatment sessions or begin the therapy for the first time. Some had given food, others began drinking more. Several people said they were suicidal. Among the numerous sources of our research, Bungie was thought to be better than many other games studios in strange ways. Few people knew about such a large physical abuse and assault; few still encountered no inappropriate behavior. Yet, as one woman pointed it out, a “Cosby Suite” scandal is not necessary to make the company’s culture problematic. The one who said ‘we’re not gay’ is a simple person. I understand, but it’s some subtle things that you haven’t noticed. It’s a pay depreciation. The data shows how many women leave, how many minorities leave. They discount each story by saying: “They weren’t happy, they weren’t cultures fit.” Knowing and quantifying these things is harder. There isn’t a silver bullet, it is not a smoking gun. Even though you compare all the things to each other, it is quite a picture… white men at the top, promoted, paid well, minority people get angry! All these things indicate there’s a problem, not simply being content that you have never heard anyone say anything racist. The stories we have shared up are the worst in Bungie’s history and expose ourselves to work culture with deep roots that cannot be dug up overnight. For response to the comments made by IGN, Pete Parsons, President of Bungie, who has been with Bungie for almost 20 years since 2016 — reiterated that Bungie wants to try. He opened out his long reply and apologized to everybody who had “all experienced a safe, fair, and professional working environment at Bungie.” “I am not here to explain or challenge the experiences shared by people who have shared their time and their talent,” Parsons said. “Our actions, or in some cases, inactions, caused such people pain. I apologize personally and for everyone at Bungie who I know feel a deep sense of empathy and sadness read these accounts.” He elaborated several changes that the company has taken in recent years to improve its culture, many of which was also mentioned to us by actual and recent employees of that studio. Some of the workers told us they believe that, so slow, Bungie can move, largely through diversity and their allies within the studio who were relentlessly working to change their course, through individual action, company groups and increasing pressure on workers to achieve more diverse, healthy, inclusive jobs. Since the first time that created a steady but profound change that began taking place in the past few years, most of those who become more powerful and difficult are leaving the company. Most people left quietly and professionally, giving the impression that they wouldn’t depart the family, and a few left on publicly positive terms, celebrated with the entire staff and the Bungie’s community a farewell letter. Most of them still have high-ranking positions elsewhere in the sports industry. While some sources claim that certain persons among them were quietly asked to leave, the exact circumstances of this house cleaning look vague. Parsons confirmed to IGN that the departures had happened, admitting the company had been not as transparent or swift as it could’ve been in removing individuals, and adding that Bungie was able to do this only if brave people come forward or when bad behavior is conducted out in the open.” We think that those that were wrong to exclude us from our company have been terminated or are no longer working for Bungie, but if the new information comes up, whether through this story or through calls or anonymous people, we will act on that information and investigate with integrity,” Parsons said. “There’s not any catharsis. When bad actors get thrown out there, there’s no awareness of who’s a bad actor to avoid. Without that I don’t think I can build trust at a large scale.” Although this may be good news for Bungie’s future, their ex-convicts who knew of this exodus told us they felt betrayed and left behind. Their career, their mental health and their emotional wellbeing have been repeated for years, have they said. In addition, the people who pounced on them moved on to other companies and will continue to be celebrated largely by their colleagues and the gaming public. So even in an article like that, there is no place to call them out. One man said: “You need justice.” That’s what’s out. There is no catharsis…when bad actors thrown out, there is no awareness… of who is a bad actor to avoid. Without that I don’t think it’s possible to build trust at a large scale.” In general, company culture is always a work of progress, but Bungie has taken some specific actions in the past few years in the right direction. Various sources say that in 2018, when Bungie began a Diversity \u0026/ Inclusion lead, the studio had to work with a large number of people at leadership positions to make up their progress. Even though some people in the studio pushed back, these goals were put in place. And while there is still work to do, Bungie’s blog post maintains that there’s progress at the top level of the company. According to Parsons, women or people from underrepresented communities comprise half of Bungie’s board of directors and 40% of Bungie’s executive team are women or people from underrepresented communities. More recent employees we spoke to showed that this more diverse shift is not only apparent at the company’s leadership levels, but throughout most departments, too. Since Bungie didn’t share their older statistics for comparison, it also provided recent numbers: 20.5% of Bungie employees are women, and women made up 331% of Bungies new hires in 2021 and 22.5% of employees at the leadership level. An underrepresented population, the company is 18,6 %, 23 % of new hires in 2021 and 20 % of company leaders are members of underrepresented groups. When people are trying and they think they need many points of view, they don’t always see that that problem as well. Sometimes they get lost. While its first compass departed in 2020, Bungie replaced her just a new director for her to continue and spearhead these efforts, including ongoing work with GRGs such as Black at Bungie, women at Bungie, Trans at Bungie, and new accessibility at Bungie, as well as new initiatives to increase company benefits, encouraging diversity speakers and promoting new charitable initiatives. Bungie, as well as Hiponia and many others quit, were conceived and conceived by the ERG in one direction, to make small but meaningful improvements to company culture. And in this year, Parsons said, its first attempt was to examine the hiring and compensation and promotion activities, but instead, it started to hire a third-party to test its compensation practices. Many of our sources and Parsons have also confirmed that Bungies crunch issues have actively improved over the last several years, although sources said some teams still struggled here and there. It was cited as a further active development. In recent years, there was a push for progress to progress to “Agile development”, effectively a methodology where teams come to development solutions through collaboration and teamwork. However, opinions were mixed regarding the initial use of this technique, but the current employees we spoke to felt it really has changed a bit. “Since you compare his irreverent past to an era of power and culture, what is to be the best or build aspirational moonshots, I think that people must respect each other” said one. It was like stone sharpening stones by bringing them to the other. The shift in productivity, namely social skills, is to the empathetic self-image of people. People are trying, and they need more perspectives, but they never do that. They sometimes go back home. “It’s getting better, and it’s our responsibility to make things better for the future.” A key to this is the company’s town hall meeting, where individuals ask responsibilities and vote on a problem, while the most popular questions in the real world are getting answers. While many people wished to hear frustration through this system, many of them would take to the correct approach. Since this system was developed by the beginning, the anonymity doesn’t seem to be available, and many sources thought they could not be candid, or remember being dogpiled by their peers or even leaders if they asked a question that others disliked. And with the addition of anonymity, sources said, more people felt comfortable asking questions about diversity, burnout and toxic studio behavior; while some felt that it was helpful to voicing concerns to managers, others noted that leadership often gave lukewarm response to serious issues. Several people recalled a senior employee responding to a question about a toxic work environment. I’m sure that nobody had ever come to him to talk about the problem as a serious issue. Other people remembered questions that seemed disconcerting or derogatory in relation to Black Lives Matter and the Employee Resource Group (ERG) Black at Bungie. One source felt that management didn’t shut down these remarks effectively. “People are willing to study but it’s not so nice to be somewhere where everyone knows already?” Out of our sources, Bungie is on the brink of a truly safe, inclusive workplace, but it is still a long road to it. Many of our employees raised the question about the culture of work, and presumably, companies like Parsons wanted to make things better. Then they just didn’t know how to fix it. The studio is full of well-meaning people even at leadership levels. They love social causes. Our criticism is the lack of knowledge in a studio. They don’t get their feet under the ground and say ‘No’. We will never try anything. That seems to be a complicated word of confusion. “How can we do that?’” A former employee said that the minorities at the studio had all the hard work to educate all the others a job that meant, at worst, doing extra unpaid labor and which some sources that did that work say was often dismissed or ignored. A second source explained that shortly: “Those who are willing to learn, but that’s all the nicest place where everybody already knows?” A few people I spoke to expressed their fears that this article would scare more diverse people who wanted to ask Bungie to make them better, without further exacerbating the studio’s problems. The studio’s consistent movement in the right direction, although some of those who expressed this fear were the victims of some incidents such as the above. “In spite of the fact that we are looking to rethink our community more closely, the better we become a company,” said one. The place we have in your office could always be better, it’s interesting to learn from you that as a company, we recognize that and we’re addressing it. One specific area in which many employees expressed optimism for the future was with Bungie’s current incubation projects, and in particular one. Bungie hasn’t kept that secret that a lot of non-destiny games are out now, though the ones we were aware of have experienced some shifts and even cancellations over the past few years. One of the projects currently greenlit and the only one that closest to release was frustrating to some of our sources. Rather, some of us found it too difficult to recruit remittment managers and good friends to make a culture a priority of Destiny. The people in the know spoke of another project with a little excitement. One described it as a huge divergence from what Bungie has done before. Others told me how a very diverse team of developers was, with a very large number of leading roles held by underrepresented minorities. One person said that was the type of team that I want Bungie to have everywhere. Someone close to the project described that group as having a positive, supportive culture where everyone was active in a sense of respect and respect of their content. They described Bungie as a new culture created intentionally as a model for what the studio wants. Another explicitly connected the values of the team working on the project with Bungie, saying that while people are probably surprised when they see the project, they will ultimately understand what it truly stands for since they were introduced in 2014. Supposedly, there should be a change in perception, and the projects show that things can be constructed differently,” said one source. Sources told us that while Bungie had a number of smaller organizations that were incubated and outside, both showed similar promise, with diverse members and multiple women in leadership roles. Their small teams were microcosms of culture that they believed would allow Bungie to thrive both internally and publicly, despite the effort to build strong, comfortable, respected teams on bold new ideas. This, combined with the more open and widespread company-wide shifts, gave many of our sources tentative hope for change, even though they emphasized that the job was far from finished. The studio had several more unhappy people expressed cynicism in response to the recent tweets. However, the group faced challenges: Don’t just talk and make statements about this matter. Upon the conclusion of his statement to IGN, Parsons seemed to agree: “As our core, we have people that are good for change in the world,” said he. I am proud of the progress we’ve made, but it isn’t enough, and it’s taken so long. It does not scare away the bad experience people have had at our studio. “As a CEO, I have the duty to examine the past and the future and be accountable for all of that, here and now. While discussing the story with the Bungie team, and seeing both known and newly discovered accounts, it’s clear that we still have work to do. “I’m committed to it. I think this studio isn’t what we have a chance to become, but we’re coming along. And we won’t stop or slow these efforts because we acknowledge the journey of diversity, and equity is all the same destination that we all strive. This is key to our vision and to achieve the potential of the welcoming, equitable house, where the creative and technical expertise is sufficient. “Our motto, “Magicly, to the stars” was the foundation of our creative craft from the start. We share this spirit of hope and improvement in the critical work that will be taken for granted. This is our future, which is our main objective. We’re grateful and humble to continue this work and energized by the future of our jobs.” Finally, everybody we spoke to loved Bungie, at least at one point. The majority believed that its wages and benefits were good. They loved their teams and their colleagues, and they loved Destiny and the other projects the studio worked on. Many do have some time. Even though many of those who had suffered acute pain, and the recent tweets and post-doing to get better, then others asked Bungie: Don’t just talk, or make calls about these problems. “Listen to your employees who have been giving this feedback instead of just saying, ‘Please give us feedback,’ ” says one more employee who joined the company recently. “Lead and act on it,” and tell us what you did. The void seems to have been talking to him. We listen to women in particular.” You’re wasting your money hiding. We know. It’s known. Show us industry-defining progress in the treatment of marginalized workers that can’t possibly be mistaken for virtue signaling.” That challenge, one pointed out, isn’t just leveled at company leadership. It’s directed towards the whole company, from all sides of the line: That’s the problem that Bungie needs to solve. Admit your failure here, and show us the roadmap for creating an employment environment for genders of marginalized descent. This slow roll-out, reactionary changes keep stability of an inefficient system in which to punish bullies and abusers, at the expense of their victims. Two days after the public start of Activision Blizzard scandal, Bungie posted a series of tweets decrying the described behavior, but distancing itself somewhat from the same behavior. While the internal response was mixed, the knowledge that Bungies culture echoed some similar themes, there was both the realization that it was not only the sort of way for improvement, but also the fact that it was well-established and useful. There are still very few people who work in Bungie, so they have a very clear line between being and doing, and they want to make sure the studio does this. “The tweet was so frustrating,” said one source, “because positioning yourself as ‘were not the problem’ in response to systemic, industry-wide misogyny perpetuates the problem”. The people who were ill when their clothes were damaged, and the implicit statement of wrongdoing… Stop defending your current and ex-employees from removing their harm. Don’t hide your mistakes! We know. It’s not clear. Show us a progression for industry-defining employees that can’t be mistaken for virtue signaling. “I want Bungie to be what it relentlessly required me to be.” I want Bungie to be brave.\n","wordCount":"7579","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-09T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-09T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bernie Rodriquez"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/the-battle-for-the-frightened-soul-of-her-brother-towards-the-strength-of-a-work-culture-a-better-work-culture-in-the-studio/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>The Battle For The Frightened Soul Of Her Brother Towards The Strength Of A Work Culture A Better Work Culture In The Studio</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 9, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;36 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7579 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Bernie Rodriquez</div></header><div class=post-content><hr><p>The company’s response was different.
Many of its current and former employees felt their experiences at the company from 2011 and from 2011 to 2014 marked the end of an intense clash with their self-portrait. While some praised the news, many others found a way of hiring a D&I director of many employees to leave mandatory arbitration was a little too late, in fact a lot. For the other rest, a long journey to a better future, but a roadblock continued, with more and more to come.
IGN spoke with 26 current and former employees that worked at Bungie in the last decade. Their accounts of the studio’s work culture encompass a wide range of experiences. They span overt sexism, boys’ club culture, crunch, and human rights protection for abusers, and more complex stories of abusers, systemic inequalities, and difficult ways of being heard. Yet even the interviewees are a number of those who, despite their own hurts, truly believe the studio is slowly but steadily improving, have candid candid stories about the huge challenge of trying to turn such a massive ship in a better direction, and who claim what’s been told at IGN with Parsons in response to this piece, is all clear and concise.
Each source we interviewed joined Bungie because they wanted to play games they liked. But they all had to have a question, the one that a massive AAA gaming company with 800 more employees can solve the problem, and become a trumpful and fun place for their jobs?
There is seemingly no better microcosm for Bungie’s historical, company-wide cultural troubles than its narrative team, which experienced a toxic leadership, issues with crunch, and sometimes impossible separation between Old and New Bungie culture, and more all within the five or six years.
We spoke with a group of people who were close to or if in the narrative team, and painted a picture of the highly divided group of people who originated from Destiny one, where their problems originated from the moment it was done. Several sources spoke of a narrative team lead from time to time who seemed to be burnt out during the project, creating a toxic work environment for others on the team. Fortunately, team members kept a countdown of days since his last “explosion” on the whiteboard. Many people I spoke to knew that he was throwing a chair at the window because others were ruining his creative vision of the game.
He stayed at the studio several years, then was then forced to quit and then asked to go back to contract work for Destiny 2. Some sources who witnessed him during that time said he would often issue narrative direction without being a senior team member, and become angry when he felt the Destiny 2 writers were deviating from the original vision for Destiny 1. One source told a story when he shouted at her over the phone so aggressively that she could’ve felt tears, and she refused to speak with him without a third party present.
This lead was not the only team member who was affected by the burnout in Destiny one and after a big number of trips left, Bungie created a new team for Destiny 2, which was more often found in white and male teams than many other teams. In fact, a series of white men started their life in a run by which they made many of our sources miserable for years. Most of the people we spoke to were reluctant to say they were mentioned in such a magazine, without any other words, fearing repercussions either on themselves or on others who had vehemently complained about perpetrators in the past.
The writer couldn’t learn about their work without making a recording of the voice. When people objected, he told them they needed thicker skins.
Many of our sources also wanted to remain anonymous to avoid reprisal or harm to their careers, but a former employee was willing to be named: Cookie Hiponia, a color-dignite who was responsible for the team’s anger. Many of our sources saw the plight of a narrative team from outside, but Hiponia was flooded with the elements. She started working as a copy editor at Bungie, then a full-time employee until 2019.
Hiponia remembered that when she was first in her seat, Bungie didn’t have big editing oversight in the Destiny franchise and had not focused much on it, its consistency, or continuity. This led to the idea that a leader can’t speak of normal-extended professional boundaries. Just like hiponia says, “They have bunch of people who wrote things and were a sort of deaf.”
One of our anonymous sources described one leader from earlier this year as a sexist nightmare in which yelled in meetings and waved the paper over tables. Numerous people told us he frequently planned to repeat the last minute of the night, often on his way to voice recording sessions. Writers won’t learn their work’s changes until the recording of a voice-smart has been done. When people objected to her demeanor, he told them they needed thicker skins and learned how to criticize. He called the two women on the team an “unmanageable bitch.” A second source said that he was “literally the worst person I’ve ever worked for.”
He was let go, but was replaced by antagonizing men – which our sources said were similarly. A leading frequently made sexist comments, but also complained about the reverse sexism, and at least one occasion made homophobic remarks to a deaf-looking colleague. He would mock his team members openly in meetings, then play off his mockery as a joke and often take credit for work other than that. Hiponia recalls a moment when said lead attempted to give the subject to a relatively new employee a post-secondary note to the top Bungie leadership when asked if the truth is true, “What are you doing anyway?” When Hiponia confronted him about his task later and asked him why he was given away, he said that he just was joking around.
One anonymous source named the third narrative lead a “clause, hierarchical, authoritarian, incurious, cruel leader” for a story. Hiponia said she frequently asked her to do administrative and secretariat tasks like taking notes or checking up information. However, she’d manage her work as a writer and a manager of the team. Others recalled that he frequently insulted people who stood up for themselves, including letting off the narrative team after they agreed on a last-minute request and asked for such an emergency to happen again. He walked away and robbed a worker who stood up for him to tell them about him. Many sources say she regularly made racist remarks, such as a lunch where one source recalled she was putting up a number of inappropriate comments about Latin American gangs.
The narrative team worked a minimum of 60, 70, 80, and even 100-hour weeks during some expansions. Most people did not break between short periods.
Even with only its turbulent senior members, the narrative team continued to be in chaos for a long time for Destiny 2, and a few of its second expansions, having to ship content new to the public. As such, there was high turnover and burnout. Hiponia recalls the ongoing struggle to hire a full-time narrative contractor to help ease the team’s burden. Even though the department was overwhelmed, it remained skeptical to call for new full-time staff, and often contracts aren’t renewed or extended in time, resulting in months-long periods where the department was left out of the department’s poor space.
Those closest to this team describe their employees working 60, 70, 80, even 100 hour weeks during expansions, often without breaks between the crunch periods. The crew member was crunched as they were sick and couldn’t type so they had to take a break for them a while.
Another source said that the team was told not to crunch in support of a growing studio push to eliminate the practice. Though the idea was that the studio would simply cut features if crunch was the only way to get them done. But many of the writers feel they’ve been backed up after the painful release of the first release of Destiny 2’s DMLC, Curse of Osiris.
The story of Osiris was under fire on Reddit – with many female narrative team members being exonerated for harassment, death threats and vitriol. Our sources say that women didn’t get support in the studio or from the community team for what they were going through, and multiple sources heard that a member of leadership still at the studio who emailed Reddit comments about these women to other company leaders in a bid to take off the narrative team because players didn’t like the story.
The same leader said that when he was dismissed about the controversy, she said that no one should be worried because they didn’t just bring back the Writers’ assignment to solve it everything. In fact, many people familiar with the team’s writing story that had a low reception in the studio after being treated poorly by other departments, were wrongly disappointed when the game was received by.
One member of the committee mailed Reddit comments about women to other company leaders in a seemingly false bid to nudge the narrative team because players didn’t like the story.
As a result, the narrative team was afraid of what would happen if something else of the community wasn’t as accurate as it was. They stopped working so they would hide overtime from their leads so they wouldn’t enforce the story cuts.
Unforgivated when there was no need to change and to change the last minute; often worsening, and often frustrated when conflicted over who was taking control of the story’s control. Aside from the different talents and groups of the studio, the creative direction was fraught. Some of Bungie’s old guard had an eye on the vision of Destiny 1 and reluctant to change all of the tone, characterizations or direction of the story as the game passed into Destiny 2. This was especially frustrating for the team in cases where that vision never existed explicitly in the game, but only existed in the minds of people that no longer worked in narrative.
A second issue was the development of the cinematic which were considered a prestige project. Largely written in the “star chamber,” the cinematics team often tried to operate without interruption compared to the main story crew – resulting in disconnects between established lore, planned quests, and major story beats. The cinematic teams rewrite a little more with Hiponia, while the movie theater would be used to making a film, such as it was recalled by others.
The clashes with those different interests caused even further problems. Underrepresented writers and allies on the team tried to do something more inclusive and thoughtful in his portrayals. Those who knew the writing team knew that many scenarios were where the students would not realize what they were doing to portray women in ways that were, with their attention or rather, sexist or degrading. The non-label writers, both women and allies, would push back, fighting for a kind of hopeful and compelling story with Destiny’s women that they were often told in its male characters.
Since they have seen many successes in this regard over the years, it was also often very hard and painful for those who bring these issues in to hear, sometimes without the assistance of some sympathetic individuals who, inside the team, have been brought in. There were some sources telling stories of male narrative leads at the studio who pushed forward stories for characters such as Eris Morn, Mara Sov, Ana Bray, Ikora Rey, Suraya Hawthorne and others that leaned on harmful stereotypes of women and mental health issues, often despite objections from women and supportive allies across the studio.
“I could be able to go on a long time after all the ways women have been made to stand by, the men on the team have written characters in baffling, unrecognizable ways,” said the source familiar with the matter.
Another example of a time when no one was listening to the diverse members of the writing team is the case of Devrim Kay, a scout player meeting at the European Dead Zone location who gives missions and talks about his love of food and tea. At the moment of Destiny 2’s development, a member of the writing team added a small piece of dialogue for Devrim, referring to missing his “partner.” It was a single, small line among many other lines, meant to be said both by Devrim and many others, but to comment about their relationships, thoughts and feelings, on similar situations. The line was taken over by multiple artists and checks and put into the game’s build as an ear before the whole team noticed it and demanded that it be taken out or the game would be unavailable in Russia or China if they didn’t stop reshaping it because it was a gay romance.
“At the time of a long time, I could talk about all the ways women have been able to stand by, with men on the team having written characters in dark, unrecognizable ways.”
I was surprised by the error when an QA tester called it a bleed-at-all – and explained it was in response. Eventually, the line was changed so that Devrim could simply talk about someone named “Marc” without an reference to it. This made it into the final game, and Bungie got praised for joining a gay character, especially as Devrim’s voice actor confirmed that they had close relationship with the media shortly after, without any explanation of the concern for the cause of the incident in the studio. Several sources remember their anger and anger: Bungie’s writers tried to promote their story by making them more inclusive with Destiny’s first canon gay relationship, Bungie leadership had tried to stop it, but was quickly influenced by it anyway.
In all of these situations, members of the writing team who fought for change, were routinely told they were difficult to work with, unsupported enough of their leaders, or were aggressive or abrasive and needed to take criticism better. These criticisms were often used to answer the question of why the team asked a candidate for promotion after each new challenge, where several people were turned down repeatedly.
Hiponia had specific conviction that she was unkind at the game, because she wasn’t good enough with her core narrative functions, despite being a conjecture for gameplay. But when she asked for time on work to play and improve, she offered to delve into a particular task.
She also said her own stress levels skyrocketed while she was at Bungie, enhancing her appetite for anti-anxiety medication, and even reducing her blood pressure, leading to stress related gastrointestinal problems that require surgery. Hiponia was not the alone source but other generations whose colleagues got stressed and broken by the time it came to an ecstasy-related issues that mattered more.
In 2018, the situation became unsolvable. It was a terrible attempt to reach their true compromise with the employees, but when they tried to work out more hard, they also were told that the people who’ve been making their lives miserable every day, but that team realized that the leads didn’t make any efforts to construct the same bridges on their end. Many wrote the CEO, Pete Parsons, begging for help. They never heard back.
It wasn’t until multiple writers quit or threatened to quit, in addition to every woman on the narrative team that Bungie finally dismissed the leads responsible for the chaos and began to take the teams concerns more seriously. Those connected to the narrative team today say that things have improved, more funding and more staff to share the load, and new leads, specifically tasked with helping the department recover. But it finally took the sacrifice of many people’s careers and mental and emotional health to get it there.
It seems to be the best example, but narrative isn’t the only thing in the department to have suffered this way. In fact, our sources pointed out that nearly every major company is involved with problems. Some said that the hypocrisy that explains how well Bungie works, is what he says:’Teams are stronger than heroes’
“It is necessary for us, to act in mutual respect, inclusivity, and support”, says the company statement. “We want to know that teams whose members speak their mind and take risks will do what no individual ever can.” Our wins are always teams wins.”
When we spoke to the people you talked, that translated to something of a horde of inequality inside, namely Bungie, which doesn’t tolerate disassholes. While he says that about leadership, including Parsons, Bungie doesn’t deal with the type of “rockstar” culture that, in other companies, has turned the subject into problematic, populous individuals and their misjudgmenting. All of them feel like having to humiliate others; whether that being harassment, toxicity or other forms of abuse.
But many of our sources say this company was simply not true until very recently. Fast everyone we spoke with had at least one, or even more long-time friends in Bungie, who seemed to be able to find nothing, protected either by their leaders or long-serving HR personnel.
“When I read the story of the Activision-Blizzard, I laughed.” “This isn’t my experience there.” They have the core value that they don’t tolerate assholes even if they’re rockstars but they do totally. What is all that’s aspirational. Those values are the values they want to attain, but they aren’t making them stronger.”
The stories of Bungie’s problematic rockstars back to his success as the creator of Halo. Some names only popped up once or twice the time we heard a single word, over multiple departments and many years of Bungie history.
They have that core value that they don’t tolerate assholes even if they are rockstars, but they totally do it. They are what they want to achieve, but they’re not enforcing them.
One top-level company leader, who had worked with Bungie since Halo was described as an “asshole” by sources, had an attitude to denial of those who brought up the company’s toxic culture, didn’t bother to learn anyone’s name, and whose inappropriate work wardrobe included a shirt with free lap rides. He was seen, too, being particularly drunk in company events, and would take his toenails on the desk. Having stood up to the company’s highest standards, the person eventually departed without a kiss. An ambiguous company email, after which he received his departure, described the company’s zero tolerance policy for bad actors and offered assistance for employees for their health.
The different person mentioned by many sources had always been in Bungie since Halo 3, eventually becoming a director-level role throughout Destiny Games. Sources described him to be excessively affluent to his team, with some noted that his team seemed more late nights than others. One described her as “just torturing” her staff, while another described a multiple instance of racism and racism. A source close to his team described numerous instances of him bullying employees during one-on-one meetings and viciously berating his team when work didn’t meet his standards.
The stories shared here are far from the only examples where we heard a number of similar cases of behavior, not just from Bungie leaders, but also from other employees across multiple departments who often had their superiors as reason for themselves to accept their dislikes, who wouldn’t judge bad behaviour or complain against those they favored. Most of these cases, sources felt their stories are too specific to share with this piece without personally acknowledging themselves and risking retaliation or violating a non-disparagement agreement to many former employees we spoke to say they felt pressured to sign upon leaving the company.
Their fears aren’t unfounded. You can tell a lot about this person in almost every story you heard, sources say. A lot of reports were made to HR and leadership about these people, but without a word of mouth. Unfortunately, the number of HRs who seem to be unwilling to help those who complain about toxic team leaders is a long recurring theme of our interviews. Some felt their reports were ignored entirely; others told us they had been brought into meetings to unexpectedly find the person they had reported sitting in the room to discuss the issues.
There was at least one long-standing Bungie worker in HR, and still with the company, who nearly all of our sources described as actively protecting harmful individuals. Several people said their job seemed to be “to do everything,” but whenever somebody was irritated with the company. One person recalled them extremely insulting to diverse employees behind their backs and being “catty” toward women about their clothes and clothing, a woman calls for a “slut”.
You’re putting your own job on the line. “It’s a well-known fact that when you talk to HR, you are taking the right course.
This individual, with numerous other negative encounters over the years with other HR representatives, created a nearly universal mistrust in HR from almost everyone we were speaking to. Many of them noted they struggled to trust HR anywhere as a general rule. That is much better than a business with a team of members, but for many that were trained differently.
To say the truth, if you speak with HR, you can put on the line! “Responsible employees’ experience has never been compromised. They had been there to protect the company. I’ve watched that happen many times in Bungie, where someone went to HR and things went completely sideways for them.
No matter what the obvious matter is to have many people in power at Bungie, who were known as toxic, sexist, or otherwise problematic, their behaviour and beliefs across the years permeated the company’s culture in far more obvious ways. That is why, even when it comes to deciding what kind of person would use the same power and creative influence with each other.
Women particularly have struggled at Bungie over the years. As many women as I talked about, people encountered a difficult environment and developed a sexy atmosphere. Multiple sources said women were disproportionately talked over in meetings, their ability to do their jobs questioned, or their ideas ignored and then used by men who later took credit for them, or simply ignored the questions or comments of women, or merely dismissed issues that also seem to have impacted people of color at the studio of all genders, though women of color were particularly impacted. A woman recalled numerous meetings where she’d give feedback or ask a question, and no one had ever heard him say: “I was totally invisible.”
“A lot of women were put on what I would call unappealing projects that had ended up having major crunch issues, maybe even potentially quality issues, things that were not even funded very well,” said another source. The only thing that would succeed wasn’t that much.
One woman pointed to these and similar scenarios as clear examples of why Bungie has historically had so few women in leadership. She said, sometimes people of the top were friends with the Bungie topmen, then who was friends with them, and who became friends in the group. And, because it was from the beginning, it was white men. So historically it tended to stay.
Another source noted that men at Bungie have “code names” for women in the studio they found attractive, which they would often use in the studio without women knowing. Some of these names were references to their physical form, hair color or unambiguous terms.
“a lot of women…were engaged in what I said would be unappealing projects.Things that won’t succeed in a way that would allow them to shine in a review period.”
People often mention an artist for sexist remarks and encouraging his colleagues to discuss his love life on Tinder. This producer was reported to have “skyrocketed” through the ranks at Bungie, and was very charismatic and well-liked enough for Bungie’s old guard so that the reports that he had made about his behavior seemed to be misjudged. Although he was eventually fired, one former employee recalls several colleagues discussing his departure shortly after he left for work. “Before a good man who got beaten up by political correctness”, suggesting women who were reported only to get a sense of humor.
Many sources repeatedly harassed his female direct reports with sexual comments and unwanted hugs, while simultaneously belitting them and closing them in meetings. The women eventually imposed a sign at their desks encouraging both them to stay in their personal space. Another source recalls that the same woman wrote a report to his female direct report that the only reason she had her job was because she was a woman. This manager was eventually thrown out of control. However, it took a few years for this to happen.
There were different battles between the groups underrepresented. Several stories recounted conversations about managers and lead making racist remarks or even using slurs to refer to more diverse Destiny characters or, at least, that individual at the studio. Several employees also saw discrimination against transgender individuals at the studio, including questions about their restrooms, their use of correct words, and other inappropriate questions.
Between 2016 and 2018, Hiponia formed an internal diversity committee that formed the year before. The committee was a unified group that, because company limitations on allocated hours for meetings and lack of practical support for such groups, must not only meet during lunch breaks rather than working time. About half of the initial committee was made up of diverse members from different departments who were there to push for change. But, the other half was composed of all white men, who, from hiponia and other sources say, put roadblocks in at every turn. All the pushes to introduce a gender-neutral bathroom to the company, to support the Black Lives Matter movement and to complete a survey that would rate Bungie on its LGBTQ+ equality and inclusion were rejected either. Hiponia and other diverse members joined the committee in 2018 — and began to quit it in 2018. As the committee bled members, Bungie decided it was totally ineffective and shut down it.
Another group who faced tough challenges at Bungie were those who were able to handle physical or mental health issues. While the benefits of Bungie’s business were praised by many of us, many people also mentioned the problem or knowing people who had been at the center of a mental or physical health problem for whom Bungie was not only uneasy, but even hostile. Since the incident made it easier for one person to take more time to handle these issues during the period of hardship, a substitute for a substitute for a replacement of medication from a previous surgery.
All of these things whose problems are measurable, are not simply a problem, but actually because you don’t have any scold, so you have never heard anything racist.
The family who suffered from death was penalized in a review period because they were abrasive and uncommunicative, though their manager knew the context. Multiple sources knew that autism patients struggled with negative feedback without concrete advice on the way to improve communication. Still two others describe situations where they took time off to deal with either personal or familial health issues, but returned and resurfaced as if they were punished for abandoning a less desirable project.
Various people we talked to, all who were not with the company, described high level of anxiety caused by their work at Bungie, while others attribute it to an inconsistency at all to a studio’s claims to the contrary across departments like QA, localization, audio, narrative and others and references abusive managers. Many said they became depressed, eventually having to increase their treatment sessions or begin the therapy for the first time. Some had given food, others began drinking more. Several people said they were suicidal.
Among the numerous sources of our research, Bungie was thought to be better than many other games studios in strange ways. Few people knew about such a large physical abuse and assault; few still encountered no inappropriate behavior. Yet, as one woman pointed it out, a “Cosby Suite” scandal is not necessary to make the company’s culture problematic.
The one who said ‘we’re not gay’ is a simple person. I understand, but it’s some subtle things that you haven’t noticed. It’s a pay depreciation. The data shows how many women leave, how many minorities leave. They discount each story by saying: “They weren’t happy, they weren’t cultures fit.” Knowing and quantifying these things is harder. There isn’t a silver bullet, it is not a smoking gun. Even though you compare all the things to each other, it is quite a picture… white men at the top, promoted, paid well, minority people get angry! All these things indicate there’s a problem, not simply being content that you have never heard anyone say anything racist.
The stories we have shared up are the worst in Bungie’s history and expose ourselves to work culture with deep roots that cannot be dug up overnight. For response to the comments made by IGN, Pete Parsons, President of Bungie, who has been with Bungie for almost 20 years since 2016 — reiterated that Bungie wants to try. He opened out his long reply and apologized to everybody who had “all experienced a safe, fair, and professional working environment at Bungie.”
“I am not here to explain or challenge the experiences shared by people who have shared their time and their talent,” Parsons said. “Our actions, or in some cases, inactions, caused such people pain. I apologize personally and for everyone at Bungie who I know feel a deep sense of empathy and sadness read these accounts.”
He elaborated several changes that the company has taken in recent years to improve its culture, many of which was also mentioned to us by actual and recent employees of that studio. Some of the workers told us they believe that, so slow, Bungie can move, largely through diversity and their allies within the studio who were relentlessly working to change their course, through individual action, company groups and increasing pressure on workers to achieve more diverse, healthy, inclusive jobs.
Since the first time that created a steady but profound change that began taking place in the past few years, most of those who become more powerful and difficult are leaving the company. Most people left quietly and professionally, giving the impression that they wouldn’t depart the family, and a few left on publicly positive terms, celebrated with the entire staff and the Bungie’s community a farewell letter. Most of them still have high-ranking positions elsewhere in the sports industry. While some sources claim that certain persons among them were quietly asked to leave, the exact circumstances of this house cleaning look vague. Parsons confirmed to IGN that the departures had happened, admitting the company had been not as transparent or swift as it could’ve been in removing individuals, and adding that Bungie was able to do this only if brave people come forward or when bad behavior is conducted out in the open.”
We think that those that were wrong to exclude us from our company have been terminated or are no longer working for Bungie, but if the new information comes up, whether through this story or through calls or anonymous people, we will act on that information and investigate with integrity,” Parsons said.
“There’s not any catharsis. When bad actors get thrown out there, there’s no awareness of who’s a bad actor to avoid. Without that I don’t think I can build trust at a large scale.”
Although this may be good news for Bungie’s future, their ex-convicts who knew of this exodus told us they felt betrayed and left behind. Their career, their mental health and their emotional wellbeing have been repeated for years, have they said. In addition, the people who pounced on them moved on to other companies and will continue to be celebrated largely by their colleagues and the gaming public. So even in an article like that, there is no place to call them out.
One man said: “You need justice.” That’s what’s out. There is no catharsis…when bad actors thrown out, there is no awareness… of who is a bad actor to avoid. Without that I don’t think it’s possible to build trust at a large scale.”
In general, company culture is always a work of progress, but Bungie has taken some specific actions in the past few years in the right direction. Various sources say that in 2018, when Bungie began a Diversity &/ Inclusion lead, the studio had to work with a large number of people at leadership positions to make up their progress. Even though some people in the studio pushed back, these goals were put in place.
And while there is still work to do, Bungie’s blog post maintains that there’s progress at the top level of the company. According to Parsons, women or people from underrepresented communities comprise half of Bungie’s board of directors and 40% of Bungie’s executive team are women or people from underrepresented communities.
More recent employees we spoke to showed that this more diverse shift is not only apparent at the company’s leadership levels, but throughout most departments, too. Since Bungie didn’t share their older statistics for comparison, it also provided recent numbers: 20.5% of Bungie employees are women, and women made up 331% of Bungies new hires in 2021 and 22.5% of employees at the leadership level. An underrepresented population, the company is 18,6 %, 23 % of new hires in 2021 and 20 % of company leaders are members of underrepresented groups.
When people are trying and they think they need many points of view, they don’t always see that that problem as well. Sometimes they get lost.
While its first compass departed in 2020, Bungie replaced her just a new director for her to continue and spearhead these efforts, including ongoing work with GRGs such as Black at Bungie, women at Bungie, Trans at Bungie, and new accessibility at Bungie, as well as new initiatives to increase company benefits, encouraging diversity speakers and promoting new charitable initiatives. Bungie, as well as Hiponia and many others quit, were conceived and conceived by the ERG in one direction, to make small but meaningful improvements to company culture. And in this year, Parsons said, its first attempt was to examine the hiring and compensation and promotion activities, but instead, it started to hire a third-party to test its compensation practices.
Many of our sources and Parsons have also confirmed that Bungies crunch issues have actively improved over the last several years, although sources said some teams still struggled here and there. It was cited as a further active development. In recent years, there was a push for progress to progress to “Agile development”, effectively a methodology where teams come to development solutions through collaboration and teamwork. However, opinions were mixed regarding the initial use of this technique, but the current employees we spoke to felt it really has changed a bit.
“Since you compare his irreverent past to an era of power and culture, what is to be the best or build aspirational moonshots, I think that people must respect each other” said one. It was like stone sharpening stones by bringing them to the other. The shift in productivity, namely social skills, is to the empathetic self-image of people. People are trying, and they need more perspectives, but they never do that. They sometimes go back home.
“It’s getting better, and it’s our responsibility to make things better for the future.”
A key to this is the company’s town hall meeting, where individuals ask responsibilities and vote on a problem, while the most popular questions in the real world are getting answers. While many people wished to hear frustration through this system, many of them would take to the correct approach. Since this system was developed by the beginning, the anonymity doesn’t seem to be available, and many sources thought they could not be candid, or remember being dogpiled by their peers or even leaders if they asked a question that others disliked.
And with the addition of anonymity, sources said, more people felt comfortable asking questions about diversity, burnout and toxic studio behavior; while some felt that it was helpful to voicing concerns to managers, others noted that leadership often gave lukewarm response to serious issues. Several people recalled a senior employee responding to a question about a toxic work environment. I’m sure that nobody had ever come to him to talk about the problem as a serious issue. Other people remembered questions that seemed disconcerting or derogatory in relation to Black Lives Matter and the Employee Resource Group (ERG) Black at Bungie. One source felt that management didn’t shut down these remarks effectively.
“People are willing to study but it’s not so nice to be somewhere where everyone knows already?”
Out of our sources, Bungie is on the brink of a truly safe, inclusive workplace, but it is still a long road to it. Many of our employees raised the question about the culture of work, and presumably, companies like Parsons wanted to make things better. Then they just didn’t know how to fix it.
The studio is full of well-meaning people even at leadership levels. They love social causes. Our criticism is the lack of knowledge in a studio. They don’t get their feet under the ground and say ‘No’. We will never try anything. That seems to be a complicated word of confusion. “How can we do that?&rsquo;”
A former employee said that the minorities at the studio had all the hard work to educate all the others a job that meant, at worst, doing extra unpaid labor and which some sources that did that work say was often dismissed or ignored. A second source explained that shortly: “Those who are willing to learn, but that’s all the nicest place where everybody already knows?”
A few people I spoke to expressed their fears that this article would scare more diverse people who wanted to ask Bungie to make them better, without further exacerbating the studio’s problems. The studio’s consistent movement in the right direction, although some of those who expressed this fear were the victims of some incidents such as the above.
“In spite of the fact that we are looking to rethink our community more closely, the better we become a company,” said one. The place we have in your office could always be better, it’s interesting to learn from you that as a company, we recognize that and we’re addressing it.
One specific area in which many employees expressed optimism for the future was with Bungie’s current incubation projects, and in particular one. Bungie hasn’t kept that secret that a lot of non-destiny games are out now, though the ones we were aware of have experienced some shifts and even cancellations over the past few years. One of the projects currently greenlit and the only one that closest to release was frustrating to some of our sources. Rather, some of us found it too difficult to recruit remittment managers and good friends to make a culture a priority of Destiny.
The people in the know spoke of another project with a little excitement. One described it as a huge divergence from what Bungie has done before. Others told me how a very diverse team of developers was, with a very large number of leading roles held by underrepresented minorities. One person said that was the type of team that I want Bungie to have everywhere.
Someone close to the project described that group as having a positive, supportive culture where everyone was active in a sense of respect and respect of their content. They described Bungie as a new culture created intentionally as a model for what the studio wants. Another explicitly connected the values of the team working on the project with Bungie, saying that while people are probably surprised when they see the project, they will ultimately understand what it truly stands for since they were introduced in 2014.
Supposedly, there should be a change in perception, and the projects show that things can be constructed differently,” said one source.
Sources told us that while Bungie had a number of smaller organizations that were incubated and outside, both showed similar promise, with diverse members and multiple women in leadership roles. Their small teams were microcosms of culture that they believed would allow Bungie to thrive both internally and publicly, despite the effort to build strong, comfortable, respected teams on bold new ideas. This, combined with the more open and widespread company-wide shifts, gave many of our sources tentative hope for change, even though they emphasized that the job was far from finished.
The studio had several more unhappy people expressed cynicism in response to the recent tweets. However, the group faced challenges: Don’t just talk and make statements about this matter.
Upon the conclusion of his statement to IGN, Parsons seemed to agree:
“As our core, we have people that are good for change in the world,” said he. I am proud of the progress we’ve made, but it isn’t enough, and it’s taken so long. It does not scare away the bad experience people have had at our studio.
“As a CEO, I have the duty to examine the past and the future and be accountable for all of that, here and now. While discussing the story with the Bungie team, and seeing both known and newly discovered accounts, it’s clear that we still have work to do.
“I’m committed to it. I think this studio isn’t what we have a chance to become, but we’re coming along. And we won’t stop or slow these efforts because we acknowledge the journey of diversity, and equity is all the same destination that we all strive. This is key to our vision and to achieve the potential of the welcoming, equitable house, where the creative and technical expertise is sufficient.
“Our motto, “Magicly, to the stars” was the foundation of our creative craft from the start. We share this spirit of hope and improvement in the critical work that will be taken for granted. This is our future, which is our main objective. We’re grateful and humble to continue this work and energized by the future of our jobs.”
Finally, everybody we spoke to loved Bungie, at least at one point. The majority believed that its wages and benefits were good. They loved their teams and their colleagues, and they loved Destiny and the other projects the studio worked on. Many do have some time. Even though many of those who had suffered acute pain, and the recent tweets and post-doing to get better, then others asked Bungie: Don’t just talk, or make calls about these problems.
“Listen to your employees who have been giving this feedback instead of just saying, ‘Please give us feedback,’ ” says one more employee who joined the company recently. “Lead and act on it,” and tell us what you did. The void seems to have been talking to him. We listen to women in particular.”
You’re wasting your money hiding. We know. It’s known. Show us industry-defining progress in the treatment of marginalized workers that can’t possibly be mistaken for virtue signaling.”
That challenge, one pointed out, isn’t just leveled at company leadership. It’s directed towards the whole company, from all sides of the line:
That’s the problem that Bungie needs to solve. Admit your failure here, and show us the roadmap for creating an employment environment for genders of marginalized descent. This slow roll-out, reactionary changes keep stability of an inefficient system in which to punish bullies and abusers, at the expense of their victims.
Two days after the public start of Activision Blizzard scandal, Bungie posted a series of tweets decrying the described behavior, but distancing itself somewhat from the same behavior. While the internal response was mixed, the knowledge that Bungies culture echoed some similar themes, there was both the realization that it was not only the sort of way for improvement, but also the fact that it was well-established and useful. There are still very few people who work in Bungie, so they have a very clear line between being and doing, and they want to make sure the studio does this.
“The tweet was so frustrating,” said one source, “because positioning yourself as ‘were not the problem’ in response to systemic, industry-wide misogyny perpetuates the problem”. The people who were ill when their clothes were damaged, and the implicit statement of wrongdoing… Stop defending your current and ex-employees from removing their harm. Don’t hide your mistakes! We know. It’s not clear. Show us a progression for industry-defining employees that can’t be mistaken for virtue signaling.
“I want Bungie to be what it relentlessly required me to be.” I want Bungie to be brave.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/the-addams-family-mansion-mayhem-free-download/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Addams Family Mansion Mayhem Free Download</span></a>
