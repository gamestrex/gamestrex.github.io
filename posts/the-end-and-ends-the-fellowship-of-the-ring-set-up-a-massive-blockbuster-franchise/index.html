EDITION: Raising a fifth anniversary: A very good Star Wars story to be made. The difference is that in the way that Jackson with writings Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens patiently lays the foundation for the rest of the series, introducing key characters such as Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin), Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom), both as well as incorporating certain elements of cinematic works which will re-sell later.\nLet’s start from the beginning. Fellowship kicks off with an incredibly interesting, yet just structured prologue that gives us the story so far. In essence, this is similar to Star Wars opening crawl, but more visually opulent: the fact that there is not a’remark of the opening and closing ceremony’, in that way it’s a result of the fact that it is a hugely successful race of war. From the beginning, the audience understands Middle-earth, and its importance. Jackson now downswung to Shire via an algorithm that introduces Bilbo (Ian Holm), Frodo and Gandalf. This sequence does a great job of displaying a beautiful, natural, world filled with luscious trees and vegetation, inhabited by real people as a complete contrast to the dark, barren landscapes that are seen in the prologue. Now, we know what would be at stake in Sauron once more. We also see Frodo as a simple gentleman who spends his days liarating books in the forest and attending partying with his fellow Hobbits. He reads about other people’s adventures, particularly the exploits of Bilbo, but doesn’t like taking part in the adventures. On the second day of the King’s Return, he wrote about his life and began writing one’s own tale. The second most interesting piece was that of the final movie, the second-half of the final movie. We also learnt quite a lot about wizards in the Opening sequences of the Shire. Gandalf enjoys the parties, but don’t make a point of the nonsense. When Merry and Pippin took off a large firework, dressed like Smaug’s dragon, the dymbal-haired, gray-robe imposed a worthy punishment. Don’t forget that about 20 minutes were spent in that film now (and 25 minutes in the extended edition). In fact, Gandalf vs. Saruman are the first set pieces to happen until the 40-minute mark; and even that sequence is more about Sarumans treachery than action. One of my favourite scenes in the trilogy has much more to do with character and plot than to delight audiences. At around the hour mark, Frodo and Sam, yet on their journey, but not fully aware of the dangers lurking beneath them, pass upon Merry and Pippin. There’s an odd little thing where the foursome stumble down a hill and run into mushrooms and then this happens: the chicken has not eaten the meat. When Frodo and Sam start taking the stage, and sleeping on the ground, praising Merry and Pippin for stealing some crops, they eventually become an intense situation. This scene, shot like a horror movie, captures the growing dread and finally ends with Frodo understanding the true power of the One Ring for the first time. I love it. The film, by chance, keeps the play off as soon as possible. We haven’t even met Liv Tylers Arwen yet, but already Jackson has sown the seeds for Aragorn and Arwens subplot another bit that doesn’t pay off completely until the final film. With the conclusion of their story being finalized, audience members are fully invested and more than likely bawling their eyes out. First half of the Ring shows how it’s set in the characters, the stakes and the key odeposition so that the second half can more gently bend on the action. And yet despite the massive set pieces including the spectacular Mines of Moria/Bridge of Khazad Dum sequence, Jackson continues to make a quieter sound note like this: a sound of all apocalypse: ‘By a hint of your head’, he is even taking a breath from the outside of this shattered world. Again, this moment is a clever exposition mixed with character development. We learn more about Gollums tragic backstory and see Frodos current odour: the Hobbit struggles to know his role in the story. So naturally, Gandalf reassures him and advises him and argues that the young hero can appreciate it. When the wizard dies, he looks a bit bored and, plus importantly, a lot of people: an idiot. In the last third of the movie, Jackson position Frodo to a position that allows him to separate himself from the rest of the Fellowship, where he stayed up until Sam proves his loyalty. Following Fellowship, Frodo has evolved from a playful, careless Hobbit without responsibility to a true hero ready to take whatever challenges are ahead of him. The character doesn’t have the same significant arc in the films that focus more on the physical and psychological tole beset by the Power Ring, which was why the first movie was important to establish his individual growth.

Note the contrast between the film’s beginning and ending with a film of Frodo sitting in the forest reading a book by himself and the final photo that he stood on the wall of a mountain with his loyal friend Sam, in the film. It’s such a striking piece of visual storytelling that has an added value to the experience. It’s what makes Fellowship such a brilliant motion picture. A lower director would have difve headfirst into the action or spend too much time delivering some dry bits of exposition. Jackson spends nearly three hours introducing this strange new world to his audience via magnificent moments such as this that also expand our developed characters, in this case, we learn a little more about Aragorn than kings of old: kings of afar. The vast action climax in which our weary troupe occupied Urak-hai carries a real significance because it surrounded himself by Boromirs’ noble death. His arrow-ridden demise only works because Jackson gave a lot of time to Boromirs character. We understand his distress, reason for his sin, because of this idiom, showing his growing frustrations and frustrations. I love that Aragorn wears Boromirs gloves at the end of the film, so he accepts his duty to his kin. Now, small details that really aren’t possible to make a large narrative that could easily take off with its own weight. Even the aforementioned Mines of Moria sequence features tiny character flourishes that help in the grand picture. Having a strong clumsy will lead to the death of Gandalfs, Boromir loves the people, and his love for the people makes him take a Merry andPippin and leap across the stairs in the middle of the hill, Legolas save Gimlis life. And we even see how important the quest for destruction of the Ring is when Gandalf sacrifices his life to save the Fellowship. For good reason, nothing in fellowship is the sacrifice of action. Each scene has its purpose on the face of a big day either by conveying the importance of the trip to the audience, or by further developing the characters. As such, Return of the King works wonders, because, after all the obliteracy and the sheer reliance Sams has on his own obliteracy, the payoff is absolutely amazing both in visual and emotional level. (Pardonally, that’s why I am so excited for more of the Denis Villeneuves Dune series. The first film, released in October, spent nearly three hours building the huge universe. In Dune: part II, he can throw a lot of challenges and sets of pieces he wants on the screen, because already the audience will be fully on board. Hopefully, Villeneuve continues the landing. Of course, its sad that after all of these years, no other trilogy has matched Peter Jackson’s grand design. The Harry Potter trilogy comes near, and Marvel has certainly done an excellent job sprinkling its ever-expanding universe with highly likable characters. In spite of that, nothing really captured the magnificence of Lord of the Rings, especially because studios want to skip Fellowship, or otherwise go straight to The Two Towersor misinterpret what made Fellowship so good for starters. After all, before the kingdom of the Holy Order, the empire grew into a massive billion dollar mega-bittarian franchise, its roots and beginnings began to be the foundation of four Hobbits, a wizard, an elf, a dwarf and two men. They represent The Lord of the Ring, all of whom represent The Fellowship of the Ring.\n","wordCount":"1522","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-22T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ronald Cruz"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/the-end-and-ends-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-set-up-a-massive-blockbuster-franchise/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>The End And Ends The Fellowship Of The Ring Set Up A Massive Blockbuster Franchise</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-12-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>December 22, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1522 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Ronald Cruz</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#lets-start-from-the-beginning>Let’s start from the beginning.</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>In spite of the extravagance of return of the King, two years later and the Jacksons Hobbit trilogy, which were essentially soulless animated blockbusters, we tend to forget that Fellowship was the most significant, relatively small film (at its own cost and comparative to the sequels) about the relationships forged between a small and diverse group of individuals while continuing on a long journey.
