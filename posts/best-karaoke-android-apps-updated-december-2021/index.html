It is essentially an automated recording app that combines harmonious harmony with vocoding to help you correct your voice based on the genre and your tune.
You can pick up the song from your device’s music library and sing along with it, and record a selfie if you like. You can choose from some dozens of vocal effects presets, so you can listen and polish your voice. You can also edit your recordings using different mixers, equalizers, and vocal effects. You could even crop the track to remove unwanted parts.
Voloco can even share your performances in audio and video with others or post them on social media. If you want to mix things together with a different app, you can export all the songs together as well.
