So, we’ve explained all the processes and drop and craft odds below, to help you search and farm for Legendary Gems as quickly as possible. There’s also a Legendary Gem list at the end with base abilities and stats for all 1-Star, 2-Star, and 5-Star Legendary Gems in Diablo Immortal.\nDiablo Immortal Legendary Gems explained Legendary Gems are the best way to improve the build of any character class in Diablo Immortal. Much like the numbered games in the series, Legendary Gems boost stats, and provide unique abilities. In Diablo Immortal, they also increase your Resonance, which can give your character even more power.\nDiablo Immortal Legendary Gems explained How to get Legendary Gems in Diablo Immortal How to upgrade Legendary Gems in Diablo Immortal\nGem list:\nDiablo Immortal all Legendary Gems list\nYou can slot up to six Legendary Gems in different pieces of equipment, but can’t equip more than one of the same type.\rWhen you get a Legendary Gem of any type, there are three stats you should pay attention to: its star tier, its star rating, and its rank.\nLegendary Gems Star tiers Each Legendary Gem has a one, two, or five star rating under its picture, this represents the Gem’s tier, and there’s nothing you can do to change it. A Trickshot Gem, for example, will always be a 1-Star Legendary Gem.\nLegendary Gems Star rating There is, however, an additional, randomised, star rating on top of this first tier star rating for 5-Star Legendary Gems. It’s a horrible naming system, but what it essentially means is that not all 5-Star Legendary Gems of the same type will have the exact same abilities and stats. A 5-Star tier Bottled Hope Legendary Gem, for example, can be a 2-Star, 3-Star, 4-Star, or 5-Star rated Bottled Hope Gem. This determines the number of abilities you receive from socketing the Gem, the stats for them, and how much Resonance is added to your build.\rThese additional star ratings are represented by how many of the stars are gold, and just like the tier star rating, it can’t be changed. 1-Star and 2-Star Legendary Gems do not have this star rating, so you don’t need to worry about looking for different ratings while hunting for them.\nLegendary Gem rank What you can change is a Legendary Gem’s rank. This can upgrade stats like basic attributes and damage percentage. What gets improved with each rank is determined by what Gem you’re upgrading.\rUpgrading a Legendary Gem’s rank is the only way to make it better. It’s unfortunately a very costly process for the higher Star tier Gems, and can take free-to-play characters a long time to upgrade the rank of even one 5-Star tier Legendary Gem. Even if you are spending money, there’s no guarantee you will have the materials needed to rank up your Legendary Gems.\nHow to get Legendary Gems in Diablo Immortal While you don’t need to focus on getting the best Gems to complete the story on normal difficulty, you will need to turn your focus to Legendary Gems for the postgame content in Diablo Immortal.\rThere are ways to pay for items that can get you Legendary Gems, including a way to (sort of) buy the one you want. You can also work toward a Legendary Gem drop without spending money, but it will take you a very long time to get the specific Gems you’re after.\rHere are all the ways you can get Legendary Gems in Diablo Immortal:\nRunning Elder Rifts with Crests Joining a party running an Elder Rift with Crests Craft with Runes at the Apprentice Jeweler Purchase from the Marketplace Battle Pass rewards Purchasing from the Hilts trader\nRunning Elder Rifts with Crests The best way to consistently get Legendary Gems in Diablo Immortal is to participate in Elder Rifts using Legendary Crests, preferably with a party who are also using Legendary Crests. You can also buy Eternal Legendary Crests for 160 Eternal Orbs. They work the exact same as ordinary Legendary Crests, but the two don’t share the same pity system.\rWhen you run an Elder Rift with a Legendary Crest, you are guaranteed a Legendary Gem after completing it. The more Legendary Crests you use before starting an Elder Rift, the more Legendary Gems will drop after killing the Rift Guardian.\rHere are the Legendary Gem drop odds for completing Elder Rifts:\n1-Star Legendary Gem: 75.4% 2-Star Legendary Gem: 20.1% 5-Star Legendary Gem: 4.5%\nThere are also odds for what rating your 5-Star Legendary Gems will receive:\n2-Star rating: 75% 3-Star rating: 20% 4-Star rating: 4% 5-Star rating: 1%\nTo further increase the amount of Legendary Gems you get from an Elder Rift, make sure to run it with as many party members as possible who are using their own Legendary Crests, as all team members benefit from each other’s Crests.\rYou can get one free Legendary Crest from the battle pass, and from purchasing one a month from the Hilt trader. For more, you’ll either have to buy the premium battle pass or buy Eternal Legendary Crests from the Crest Merchant, who is located by the Elder Rift entrance.\nCraft with Runes at the Apprentice Jeweler Another way to get Legendary Gems in Diablo Immortal is to craft them by using Runes. You’ll still need to run Elder Rifts to get Runes, but you only need to use Rare Crests, not scarce Legendary Crests.\rThe more Rare Crests you use on an Elder Rift, the more Runes and Fading Ember you will receive as completion rewards. Just like with Legendary Crests, we recommend using Rare Crests as part of a party, so everyone gets rewards from each other’s Rare Crests.\rYou can get a Rare Crest everyday by interacting with the Elder Rift entrance, and from both the free and premium tiers of the battle pass. The Hilts trader will also have two Rare Crests available every day for 300 Hilts, and are also sometimes part of his limited-time deals.\rWhen you’ve earned enough Fading Embers, go to the Fading Embers and Runes vendor located just below the Elder Rift steps. Here, you can trade x18 Fading Embers for x1 Fa Rune, which can then be used to craft a random 1-Star, 2-Star, or 5-Star tier Legendary Gem.\rAt the Fading Embers and Runes vendor, you can also trade in Magic and Rare Runes along with Fading Embers for Ati Runes. These are used in combinationwith other Runes to make specific 1-Star and 2-Star Legendary Gems at the Apprentice Jeweler, so it’s not always a good idea to just trade in every Rune that isn’t Fa or Ati.\rWhen you’ve bought your Runes, head to the Apprentice Jeweler in the middle of Westmarch, below Central Square, to craft Legendary Gems Here’s what it costs to make a randomised Legendary Gem at the Apprentice Jeweler:\nRandom 1-Star Legendary Gem: x7 Fa Runes Random 2-Star Legendary Gem: x28 Fa Runes Random 1-Star, 2-Star, or 5-Star Legendary Gem: x22 Fa Runes\nAlthough the potential to get a 5-Star Legendary Gem by spending x22 Fa Runes sounds good, it actually only has a 4.5% chance of being crafted. With all the grinding in Elder Rifts with Rare Crest you’ll have to do, it can take a very long time to get a 5-Star Legendary Gem by crafting.\rThis odd factors in all the star rarities you could get when crafting a randomised 5-Star Gem, so here’s their individual odds:\n5-Star Legendary Gem with a 2 star rating: 3.375% 5-Star Legendary Gem with a 3 star rating: 0.9% 5-Star Legendary Gem with a 4 star rating: 0.18% 5-Star Legendary Gem with a 5 star rating: 0.0045%\nAs for the other tiers, there’s a 75.395% chance of getting a 1-Star, and a 20.105% chance of getting a 2-Star Legendary Gem from spending x22 Fa Runes at the Apprentice Jeweler.\rWhile your crafting, look out for the word ‘Unbound’ in the Gem description, this means that you can sell it at the Marketplace for Platinum. This is handy for if you’re just crafting random Gems in the hope of getting a 5-Star.\nPurchase from the Marketplace The Marketplace might bring back some uncomfortable Diablo 3 Auction House memories for some, but at the moment it’s basically just another way to get Legendary Gems in Diablo Immortal.\rThe catch is you’ll need Platinum to buy anything at the Marketplace, but large amounts can be earned by selling your own unwanted Gems and Skill Stones. Everything seems to come back to Elder Rifts in the end, however, as running them with Crests is how you’ll get Gems to sell, or materials to make them.\rYou can also get Platinum by completing daily and other special quests, or from purchasing from the in-game shop. You’ll first have to buy Eternal Orbs from the same tab in the shop to buy the Platinum.\rThe appeal of The Marketplace is that it lets you buy the specific Legendary Gem that you want. Prices are set by the seller, but they’re regulated. Even with this regulation, a 5-Star Legendary Gem is likely to cost 30 to 80 thousand Platinum for one, depending on the Gem’s star rating. Another downside to the Marketplace is that popular Legendary Gems like the Blood-Soaked Jade are often out of stock, as there are few people willing to sell it. You can, however, add any Gem to your Watchlist and get notified when it’s back in stock.\rIf you’re selling at the Marketplace it’s important to note that you can only put Gems and Skill Stones up for sale that are unbound. So any Gems you get from story progression, or as battle pass rewards, can’t be sold for Platinum. Some crafted Gems can also be bound to you, so be careful to read the description when making them.\nBattle Pass rewards You can also get Legendary Gems from both the free and premium tiers of the battle pass in Diablo Immortal. If you do purchase the premium battle pass for £5.49, you’ll get all the Legendary Gems from both tiers, as long as you reach the required levels before the end of the battle pass.\rTo level-up the battle pass, you need to get Battle Points, which can be earned by completing Elder Rifts, bounties, reaching milestones, and completing specific dungeons. Open your Codex and select the ‘Battle Pass’ tab to see what you can still do to earn Battle Points.\nHilts trader Once a month, you can purchase a Legendary Gem from the Hilts trader. He used to be called the Honor merchant in the beta, but even though he’s had a name change, you can still find him in the northeastern corner of the Westmarch hub area.\rThe first Legendary Gem you could purchase from the Hilts trader outside of the beta was Ca’arsen’s Invigoration, a 1-Star, for 1600 Hilts. Although the Gem, tier, and Hilts costs might change in future months.\nHow to upgrade Legendary Gems in Diablo Immortal You can’t upgrade a Legendary Gem’s star tier or star rating, but you can upgrade its rank. To do this, you need Gem Fragments, and for later ranks, a duplicate Legendary Gem.\rTo upgrade Legendary Gems in Diablo Immortal, go to the Apprentice Jeweler in Westmarch, located in the middle, below Central Square. You can also craft Legendary Gems from the same menu, but to upgrade, select the ‘Manage’ tab and then the specific Gem you want to upgrade.\rGem Fragments are acquired from breaking down Legendary Gems, which is an automatic process. Tap the small square and then select the Gems you want to break down to improve a Legendary Gem in the upgrade menu, or select ‘Auto Fill’ if you don’t care what Gem gets turned into Gem Fragments.\rYou can upgrade a Legendary Gem to rank 10, and the higher the rank, the more Gem Fragments you’re going to need to improve it. Some rank upgrades even require a duplicate, or multiple duplicates of the same Legendary Gem, so it’s not always a good idea to sell them or use them as Gem Fragments.\rUpgrading Gems is a particularly costly process when it comes to 5-Star Legendary Gems. Getting even one is rare, so getting the multiple copies needed to improve its ranking is even rarer. Diablo Immortal is here! If you’re just getting started, you’ll want to know the best class for beginners - including the Necromancer and Crusader - and the current battle pass rewards. Our Legendary Gems and Charms guides can help you achieve the strongest build, and we also have handy maps for every Hidden Lair location, alight nine lamps puzzle solution, and the Hydra and Golem locations.\nDiablo Immortal all Legendary Gems list There are currently fourteen 1-Star, nine 2-Star, and nine 5-Star Legendary Gems in Diablo Immortal, each with their own unique abilities and stats.\n1-Star Legendary Gem list Here’s a list of every 1-Star Legendary Gem in Diablo Immortal and their base rank abilities and stats:\n2-Star Legendary Gem list Here’s a list of every 1-Star Legendary Gem in Diablo Immortal and their base rank abilities and stats:\n5-Star Legendary Gem list Here’s a list of every 5-Star Legendary Gem in Diablo Immortal and their base rank abilities and

want!\n","wordCount":"2251","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-12-24T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-12-24T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dennis

You can get one free Legendary Crest from the battle pass, and from purchasing one a month from the Hilt trader. For more, you’ll either have to buy the premium battle pass or buy Eternal Legendary Crests from the Crest Merchant, who is located by the Elder Rift entrance.</p><h3 id=craft-with-runes-at-the-apprentice-jeweler>Craft with Runes at the Apprentice Jeweler<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#craft-with-runes-at-the-apprentice-jeweler>#</a></h3><p>Another way to get Legendary Gems in Diablo Immortal is to craft them by using Runes. You’ll still need to run Elder Rifts to get Runes, but you only need to use Rare Crests, not scarce Legendary Crests.
The more Rare Crests you use on an Elder Rift, the more Runes and Fading Ember you will receive as completion rewards. Just like with Legendary Crests, we recommend using Rare Crests as part of a party, so everyone gets rewards from each other’s Rare Crests.
You can get a Rare Crest everyday by interacting with the Elder Rift entrance, and from both the free and premium tiers of the battle pass. The Hilts trader will also have two Rare Crests available every day for 300 Hilts, and are also sometimes part of his limited-time deals.
When you’ve earned enough Fading Embers, go to the Fading Embers and Runes vendor located just below the Elder Rift steps. Here, you can trade x18 Fading Embers for x1 Fa Rune, which can then be used to craft a random 1-Star, 2-Star, or 5-Star tier Legendary Gem.
At the Fading Embers and Runes vendor, you can also trade in Magic and Rare Runes along with Fading Embers for Ati Runes. These are used in combinationwith other Runes to make specific 1-Star and 2-Star Legendary Gems at the Apprentice Jeweler, so it’s not always a good idea to just trade in every Rune that isn’t Fa or Ati.
When you&rsquo;ve bought your Runes, head to the Apprentice Jeweler in the middle of Westmarch, below Central Square, to craft Legendary Gems
Here’s what it costs to make a randomised Legendary Gem at the Apprentice Jeweler:</p><p>Random 1-Star Legendary Gem: x7 Fa Runes Random 2-Star Legendary Gem: x28 Fa Runes Random 1-Star, 2-Star, or 5-Star Legendary Gem: x22 Fa Runes</p><p>Although the potential to get a 5-Star Legendary Gem by spending x22 Fa Runes sounds good, it actually only has a 4.5% chance of being crafted. With all the grinding in Elder Rifts with Rare Crest you’ll have to do, it can take a very long time to get a 5-Star Legendary Gem by crafting.
This odd factors in all the star rarities you could get when crafting a randomised 5-Star Gem, so here&rsquo;s their individual odds:</p><p>5-Star Legendary Gem with a 2 star rating: 3.375% 5-Star Legendary Gem with a 3 star rating: 0.9% 5-Star Legendary Gem with a 4 star rating: 0.18% 5-Star Legendary Gem with a 5 star rating: 0.0045%</p><p>As for the other tiers, there’s a 75.395% chance of getting a 1-Star, and a 20.105% chance of getting a 2-Star Legendary Gem from spending x22 Fa Runes at the Apprentice Jeweler.
While your crafting, look out for the word ‘Unbound’ in the Gem description, this means that you can sell it at the Marketplace for Platinum. This is handy for if you’re just crafting random Gems in the hope of getting a 5-Star.</p><h3 id=purchase-from-the-marketplace>Purchase from the Marketplace<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#purchase-from-the-marketplace>#</a></h3><p>The Marketplace might bring back some uncomfortable Diablo 3 Auction House memories for some, but at the moment it’s basically just another way to get Legendary Gems in Diablo Immortal.
The catch is you’ll need Platinum to buy anything at the Marketplace, but large amounts can be earned by selling your own unwanted Gems and Skill Stones. Everything seems to come back to Elder Rifts in the end, however, as running them with Crests is how you’ll get Gems to sell, or materials to make them.
You can also get Platinum by completing daily and other special quests, or from purchasing from the in-game shop. You’ll first have to buy Eternal Orbs from the same tab in the shop to buy the Platinum.
The appeal of The Marketplace is that it lets you buy the specific Legendary Gem that you want. Prices are set by the seller, but they’re regulated. Even with this regulation, a 5-Star Legendary Gem is likely to cost 30 to 80 thousand Platinum for one, depending on the Gem’s star rating.
Another downside to the Marketplace is that popular Legendary Gems like the Blood-Soaked Jade are often out of stock, as there are few people willing to sell it. You can, however, add any Gem to your Watchlist and get notified when it’s back in stock.
If you’re selling at the Marketplace it’s important to note that you can only put Gems and Skill Stones up for sale that are unbound. So any Gems you get from story progression, or as battle pass rewards, can’t be sold for Platinum. Some crafted Gems can also be bound to you, so be careful to read the description when making them.</p><h3 id=battle-pass-rewards>Battle Pass rewards<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#battle-pass-rewards>#</a></h3><p>You can also get Legendary Gems from both the free and premium tiers of the battle pass in Diablo Immortal. If you do purchase the premium battle pass for £5.49, you’ll get all the Legendary Gems from both tiers, as long as you reach the required levels before the end of the battle pass.
To level-up the battle pass, you need to get Battle Points, which can be earned by completing Elder Rifts, bounties, reaching milestones, and completing specific dungeons. Open your Codex and select the ‘Battle Pass’ tab to see what you can still do to earn Battle Points.</p><h3 id=hilts-trader>Hilts trader<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#hilts-trader>#</a></h3><p>Once a month, you can purchase a Legendary Gem from the Hilts trader. He used to be called the Honor merchant in the beta, but even though he’s had a name change, you can still find him in the northeastern corner of the Westmarch hub area.
The first Legendary Gem you could purchase from the Hilts trader outside of the beta was Ca’arsen’s Invigoration, a 1-Star, for 1600 Hilts. Although the Gem, tier, and Hilts costs might change in future months.</p><h2 id=how-to-upgrade-legendary-gems-in-diablo-immortal>How to upgrade Legendary Gems in Diablo Immortal<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-upgrade-legendary-gems-in-diablo-immortal>#</a></h2><p>You can’t upgrade a Legendary Gem’s star tier or star rating, but you can upgrade its rank. To do this, you need Gem Fragments, and for later ranks, a duplicate Legendary Gem.
To upgrade Legendary Gems in Diablo Immortal, go to the Apprentice Jeweler in Westmarch, located in the middle, below Central Square. You can also craft Legendary Gems from the same menu, but to upgrade, select the ‘Manage’ tab and then the specific Gem you want to upgrade.
Gem Fragments are acquired from breaking down Legendary Gems, which is an automatic process. Tap the small square and then select the Gems you want to break down to improve a Legendary Gem in the upgrade menu, or select ‘Auto Fill’ if you don’t care what Gem gets turned into Gem Fragments.
You can upgrade a Legendary Gem to rank 10, and the higher the rank, the more Gem Fragments you’re going to need to improve it. Some rank upgrades even require a duplicate, or multiple duplicates of the same Legendary Gem, so it’s not always a good idea to sell them or use them as Gem Fragments.
Upgrading Gems is a particularly costly process when it comes to 5-Star Legendary Gems. Getting even one is rare, so getting the multiple copies needed to improve its ranking is even rarer.
