If you were not to the top of my mind, that Endwalker would actually end the actual story of Final Fantasy 14s. There wasn’t an MMORPG that has a story as captivating as the one that Final Fantasy 14 has now been telling since the beginning of a decade. What kind of studio would ever be crazy enough for that kind of job to end at the right time? Although there’s a dispute that may be over whether or not Endwalker sticks to the landing (and we hope to talk more about this games story with more people when they get to experience it), it’s hard to imagine the real ending to final Fantasy 14s story, as it has always been told until now. That is a finale that is as epic as it has to be given the scope of the story so far, but isn’t a big part of my effort at these characters and the world, and of all the moments you experienced along the way. Few developers ever would be bold enough to end a story that many people once said couldn’t be this good, but Endwalkers will end your day off with a disappointment. This team is finally ready to succeed.\nFinal Fantasy 14 Endwalkers Dive and Zones Do Not Have a Good Endgame Content? As soon as you finish most MMO expansions, you battled gods and saved the universe, and fitted the sacred sweatband of GrokleThur. With the start of most MMO expansions, it’s always been very odd that suddenly forces you to fight thematically lesser enemies that are a serious threat to your god slaying player character. That is the reason I respect how Endwalkers dungeons and zones feel like a proper follow-up to what has already happened. From the moment of the expansion, the wildest stuff is still found near the end of the expansion (Endwalkers final zone is very pretty) but even the earliest content feels like a worthy thematic follow-up to what happened before. I don’t know how the Final Fantasy 14 team keeps going with relatively few diminishing returns, but the way that Endwalker acknowledges and respects his achievements is simply unbelievable.\nRead more Games\nFinal Fantasy 14 Endwalker: Every class went from the worst to the best. By Matthew Byrd. Games\nFinal Fantasy: Every story came to the best for good. By Matthew Byrd.\nFinal Fantasy 14 Endwalker doesn’t Overvalue New Content. Even some of the best MMO expansions that have ever been made (World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King) don’t think what matters most is the expansion content. These concepts are designed to make you grind for every new gear, exist only in new zones and generally, devote time to grading new character classes, because they’re typically more powerful than anything else. One may argue that there’s some thing in Endwalker. But generally speaking, I’m amazed by the amount of this expansion still value the older content of this game. If you plan on going through the new stuff, you will definitely want to see the story, then try the expansion, but this is not meant to say the only thing that really matters is what now costs the most. Few developers respect their fans very much as Final Fantasy 14 team. Endwalker is a testament to his respect, as well as the value of not trying to repeatedly overshadow and replace what came before.\nFinal Fantasy 14 Endwalker introduces wild new ideas that a certain degree work together. Since the endwalker team was assigned the monumental task of trying to successfully finish the current FF 14 story (and certainly the story will stand – for this MMO’s ability to live and tell new tales) the rest of the game would be pretty safe. The most people were pretty happy with the MMO heading into Endwalker. Instead, the developers decided to throw down some pure new ideas on the wall. From surprisingly involved stealth missions to reworks of popular character classes, Endwalker is filled with surprising deviations from current formulas and bold attempts to push the limits of this game basic concepts. Unfortunately, many famous MMO expansions are trying too hard to change what worked in the name of selling something different (looking at you, Battle For Azeroth) the Endwalker team couldn’t create so many new concepts that fit in this game incredibly well.\nFinal Fantasy 14 Endwalker recaptures the Excitement of Playing For the First Time. While I decided to keep an eye on World of Warcraft Classic because the Vanilla version of this game I liked better than the modern version of Blizzards, I argued against those who only hated it largely because they realized they wouldn’t ever be able to recreate the thrill of playing that game for the first time. That’s the most amazing thing about Endwalker. With the exception of the most spectacular of the first half of the year you spend in games and when time is overpriced, Endwalker has managed to recover from that magical feeling of starting Final Fantasy 14 and experiencing everything again. Although many other MMO expansions have survived, fans wonder whether this will be the expansion that finally rekindles the pure love they had for the game rather than feed their addictions. The battleground’s bold decisions, rich content, brilliant score, and emotional story will be the end of your love for Final Fantasy fourteen, but they will forever remember why this special feeling of playing the game for the first time has never really gone away.\n","wordCount":"1001","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-09T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-09T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Peggy Armstrong"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/why-final-fantasy-14-endwalker-is-the-best-mmo-extension-ever/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Why Final Fantasy 14 Endwalker Is The Best Mmo Extension Ever</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 9, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1001 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Peggy Armstrong</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#final-fantasy-14-endwalker-was-one-of-a-kind-enough-to-end-a-mmo-story>Final Fantasy 14 Endwalker was one-of-a-kind enough to end a MMO story.</a></li><li><a href=#final-fantasy-14-endwalkers-dive-and-zones-do-not-have-a-good-endgame-content>Final Fantasy 14 Endwalkers Dive and Zones Do Not Have a Good Endgame Content?</a></li><li><a href=#read-more>Read more</a><ul><li><a href=#final-fantasy-14-endwalker-every-class-went-from-the-worst-to-the-best>Final Fantasy 14 Endwalker: Every class went from the worst to the best.</a></li><li><a href=#final-fantasy-every-story-came-to-the-best-for-good>Final Fantasy: Every story came to the best for good.</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#final-fantasy-14-endwalker-doesnt-overvalue-new-content>Final Fantasy 14 Endwalker doesn’t Overvalue New Content.</a></li><li><a href=#final-fantasy-14-endwalker-introduces-wild-new-ideas-that-a-certain-degree-work-together>Final Fantasy 14 Endwalker introduces wild new ideas that a certain degree work together.</a></li><li><a href=#final-fantasy-14-endwalker-recaptures-the-excitement-of-playing-for-the-first-time>Final Fantasy 14 Endwalker recaptures the Excitement of Playing For the First Time.</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>Endwalker is a triumph, instead.
