Warzone Pacific: Seasons Greetings from the Isles Holidays Surprises Across Caldera, Rebirth Island Greetings Greetings of the Hawaiian Islands. Caldera presents Festive Fir Trees for All! When you leave Caldera during the festival, the damage left by the trees has always ruined the culture, unlike the rest of the Pacific lands! With the symbol of the tree on Tac Map, these temporary landmarks will be placed at certain areas of interest across the island. Those people on the list are going to be responsible for the death of the fuchse, or even the sack of the two naughty companies on the naughty list. Krampus The Death of the Isles with Plenty of Gifts for Festive Fervor. That coal found in these holiday crates does attract a certain folklore creature. Krampus spends his holiday on Caldera and Rebirth Island, where in no time of winning a match, he finds passion for sport. While his choice of target is more random here than inVanguard, he tends to hunt down the folks who received coal from Holiday Crates. If a mythical creature is done hunting, he can’t leave for the next wolf or die when he’s dead, he can’t stop the beast’s fighting. It’ll be more or less impossible for his warriors to be a permanent member of the squad facing his wrath. There are other surprises in stock throughout Festive Fervor, because of these islands being his usual stomping grounds. Fortunately, all these are relatively nice expect modifiers like increased chances of a list of rare supply boxes or half-off return returns on each day of this holiday event. Elf and Seek The Gnomes take the islands over. Just like Krampus, some mischievous creatures call their home as Caldera and Rebirth Island a real name – they are waiting for the operator to locate them. These gnomes are as carefree as Elf Team Six, hollering at any operator who can get within 10 meters of them. Squads who find and destroy them receive rewards like a Double XP or a Calling Card. I want to check the accuracy of the food. Those who want to earn the ultimate GPA would like to complete six unique challenges in the Warzone Pacific. Each with the reward, one to play with an optional ice worm and double xP token. These challenges include bringing 365 points of damage to Krampus, destroying those pesky gnomes or simply playing the game and wandering around Caldera or Rebirth Island. At this limited-time Voanguardevent, all their Bundles are available in Warzone Pacific, allowing you to die by the sand at such a big floppy or wintery sweater. (Note: There are a few items that can’t be accessed in the Warzone Pacific, see the different boxes for details).
