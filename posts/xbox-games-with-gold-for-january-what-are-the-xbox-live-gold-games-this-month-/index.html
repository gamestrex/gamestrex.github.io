There are also new games available through Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus every month. On this page: Xbox One:\nIris Fall - 1st January to 31st January Autonauts - 16th January to 15th February\nEach game is only available for a certain period of time and, provided you redeem them before they disappear, can be downloaded from your games library at any time. One Xbox One title will be available all month, while the second will only be available from the 16th of one month to the 15th of the next. Xbox 360 and Xbox titles, meanwhile, share the month - the first running from the 1st to the 15th of the month, and the second running from the 16th to the end of the month. Once you’ve redeemed a game, then it’s yours provided you maintain an Xbox Live Gold membership or an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. Don’t forget - the Xbox One and Series X are backwards compatible, so you can download any Xbox games that become available. These memberships cost:\nXbox Live Gold - £6.99 / $9.99 / €6.99 per month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate - £10.99 / $14.99 / €12.99 per month\nOnce you’ve got your membership set up, it’s time to download some games! Next, head to the Xbox Live Gold section. Here you’ll be able to find the games that are currently available to you through Xbox Games with Gold. By selecting your chosen game, you’ll be able to download it and see how long it’s available for download. You can also queue your chosen Xbox Games with Gold for download on the Xbox Games with Gold homepage. These games will be stored in your account and are then downloaded once you turn on your console. Once you’ve downloaded a game, you’ll be able to find it in ‘My games \u0026 apps’. If you own an Xbox One and cancel your Xbox Live subscription, you’ll no longer be able to access your Xbox Games with Gold games. When you renew your subscription, however, you’ll be able to play your Xbox Games with Gold games again. If you own an Xbox 360, however, the rules are a little different. You’ll be able to continue playing your Xbox Games with Gold games, as long as you keep the game downloaded, regardless of whether you have a subscription or not. Did you miss something important or has your favourite game not made the list yet?

Xbox One:</p><p>Iris Fall - 1st January to 31st January Autonauts - 16th January to 15th February</p><p>Each game is only available for a certain period of time and, provided you redeem them before they disappear, can be downloaded from your games library at any time.
One Xbox One title will be available all month, while the second will only be available from the 16th of one month to the 15th of the next.
Xbox 360 and Xbox titles, meanwhile, share the month - the first running from the 1st to the 15th of the month, and the second running from the 16th to the end of the month.
Once you&rsquo;ve redeemed a game, then it&rsquo;s yours provided you maintain an Xbox Live Gold membership or an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription.
Don&rsquo;t forget - the Xbox One and Series X are backwards compatible, so you can download any Xbox games that become available.
These memberships cost:</p><p>Xbox Live Gold - £6.99 / $9.99 / €6.99 per month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate - £10.99 / $14.99 / €12.99 per month</p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve got your membership set up, it&rsquo;s time to download some games!
Next, head to the Xbox Live Gold section. Here you&rsquo;ll be able to find the games that are currently available to you through Xbox Games with Gold.
By selecting your chosen game, you&rsquo;ll be able to download it and see how long it&rsquo;s available for download.
You can also queue your chosen Xbox Games with Gold for download on the Xbox Games with Gold homepage. These games will be stored in your account and are then downloaded once you turn on your console.
Once you&rsquo;ve downloaded a game, you&rsquo;ll be able to find it in &lsquo;My games & apps&rsquo;.
If you own an Xbox One and cancel your Xbox Live subscription, you&rsquo;ll no longer be able to access your Xbox Games with Gold games. When you renew your subscription, however, you&rsquo;ll be able to play your Xbox Games with Gold games again.
If you own an Xbox 360, however, the rules are a little different. You&rsquo;ll be able to continue playing your Xbox Games with Gold games, as long as you keep the game downloaded, regardless of whether you have a subscription or not.
