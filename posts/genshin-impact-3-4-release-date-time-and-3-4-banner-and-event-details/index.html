Genshin Impact version 3.3 is here, with new codes, and new character Scaramouche (Wanderer), so find out where he’s placed on our tier list. You’ll need Primogems and luck of the Pity and 50/50 systems to Wish with Fate for him and other current and next banners. You’ll also need the right Adventure Rank for events. For more Sumeru help, we’ve got pages on Sumeru Reputation, Tree of Dreams, Dendroculus locations, the Aeonblight Drake boss, the Garden of Endless Pillars Domain, and locations for Nilotpala Lotus, Padisarah, Scarabs, and Redcrest.\rYou can also now unlock the Genius Invokation TCG and, if you want help building your deck, check out our Genius Invokation TCG Card List.\rIf you want to relax, however, why not try fishing at one of the many fishing spot locations?\nGenshin Impact 3.4 events In addition to login rewards, the new Desert of Hadramaveth area, Alhaitham’s Story Quest, new World Quests, new boss, Genius Invokation TCG modes, and costumes for Lisa and Ayaka, we’re getting four limited-time events during the 3.4 update to Genshin Impact. We don’t have any dates or participation requirements just yet, but here’s everything we know about the limited-time events and their rewards in version 3.4:\nGenshin Impact Lantern Rite Festival 2023 event Lantern Rite returns in version 3.4! This time around, the story of Exquisite Night Chimes focuses on experiencing the festival and listening to stories with Ganyu. As for the activities themselves, we’ve got four to experience during the latest Lantern Rite Festival:\nPaper Theatre Radiant Sparks Vigilance at Sea A Combat challenge\nTaking part in each of these activities will reward Festive Fever, which can then be used to get any of the nine 4-Star Liyue characters for free - including new character Yaoyao. If you pick a character you already have, you’ll get their Stella Fortuna instead. Paper Theatre is a 2D minigame where you must move objects to change the actors’ paths to complete challenges. Radiant Sparks is a parkour minigame where you can race to collect gold coins, but this time there’s firework buffs to take advantage of to help you navigate the course in style. Vigilance at Sea is a sailing challenge where you need to collect Challenge Coins in Liyue’s high waters. There are additional obstacles and puzzles to solve this time round, and it can be played solo or in co-op. We don’t have a name for it yet, but there’s a combat challenge included in this year’s Lantern Rite that looks like a basic ‘kill all enemies’ affair. All the rewards you can earn from the 2023 Lantern Rite event include:\nA free 4-Star Liyue character Primogems Mora Crown of Insight Character Ascension Materials Character EXP Materials Talent level up materials Mystic Enhancement Ore\nGenshin Impact Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exciting Extreme Beetle Brawl event Arataki Itto returns with a new ridiculously long event name. The Exciting Extreme Beetle Brawl event sees you take control of Onikabuto to fight other beetles with special abilities. It looks a bit like a mix of a fighting and strategy game. You need to position your beetle correctly and then charge and unleash special moves to defeat your opponent, but you’ll need to be careful you don’t open yourself up to attacks from the other Onikabuto. The rewards you can earn from the Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exciting Extreme Beetle Brawl event include:\nPrimogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Talent Level-Up Materials Character EXP Materials\nGenshin Impact Warrior’s Spirit event Warrior’s Spirit is a martial arts combat competition being held in Inazuma - but you won’t be able to use your elements during any of the challenges! Instead of relying on Elemental Reactions, you need to parry and use sword techniques to win duels. However, your opponent can use these same techniques, so you’ll have to be careful. Warrior’s Spirit also introduces Ayaka in her new outfit that you can buy from the in-game shop at a reduced price during 3.4. The rewards you can earn from the Warrior’s Spirit event include:\nPrimogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Weapon Ascension Materials Character EXP Materials Talent Level Up materials\nGenshin Impact Second Blooming event Second Bloom is a team challenge event where you can get a new Lisa outfit for free by completing every challenge and reaching the required scores. You need to create three separate teams and complete consecutive combat challenges, but you can take advantage of the ‘Linked’ mechanic. Look out for the line connecting characters in the party composition menu of the event, as this means the character you put here will appear in multiple rounds. They will also benefit from bonus effects. Don’t worry if you don’t have multiple teams to use, as there will be trial characters available during the challenges. The rewards you can earn from the Second Blooming event include:\nNew costume for Lisa Primogems Mora Mystic Enhancement Ore Character EXP Materials Weapon Ascension Materials\nHope you have fun during version 3.4!
