Andrew Ross (@dengarsw):I think Gamigo will continue to make many of us miss Trion’s glory days more so than the days we do now. Final Fantasy XIV has become much worse in the future as World of Warcraft does not do worse. Crowfall has finally started, but I think it’s not only worth the money it costed, it’s also worth the wait. I’ll be a little optimistic and say that there will be something big at Activision-Blizzard before 2022. Either Kotick can’t leave, or a large group of devs will go off again, though maybe to a former Blizz head studio (Kaplan, where’s the company?). Having said that, Riot Games could actually turn into the next Blizzard, especially if Arcane was successful on Netflix and how hard Ruined King made them endure the MOBA community. With so much damage and so little to show, it won’t be winning back the fans it burned in 2020. Unless they somehow can gain some devs who could do more than follow the online tutorials, they can make something better than the dev made during their first attempt at a 3-D game (remind the team to stop talking big and just do the work). And for disappointments, I’ll say that Star Citizen isn’t coming out this year. If you don’t believe me, please. Please? VR probably sees more games built, but on larger scales, too it is likely that its more expensive they can. The same applies to most nantic-based AR games in location. On that front, I think that the team will release Transformers, announce a new partnership game (most likely with Nintendo) and either shutter or announce a shutter for Pikmin Bloom, though it can last until 2023. I mean, it’s not about community day anymore than Pokemon GOs, but on community day. As for the Pooke-System itself, I still think that it would be a crossover with Pokemon Legends: Arceus, continue to drip a gap in the Pokedex up to eight generations in-game now, and tease other AR-intensive capabilities that much-needed use can end immediately after the novelty of them wears off in minutes/hours. In fact, I’ll predict that we won’t get Kecleon until Niantic adds a new AR feature to the game. Andy McAdams: Although the leadership continues to affirm that the lol Raid for GTFO are the only people who matter in the playerbase, the success will continue to decline. The Players Council, which consist mainly of the most powerful people to say anything critical and cutting edge raiders, has the most powerful outcome, which will inevitably deliver something so deeply stupid that most of the MMOsphere is disbeliefd while Ion and friends look disturbed and ask themselves who could have predicted that this profoundly stupid thing we did would have negative consequences? Those who won’t be doing their best will continue to be ahead of the game while driving a lot of competition and expressing their own inner piety, instead of what the community values. A new existing existential threat will succeed, in making sure that we win over the death story will get predictable results. Blizzard announces an early release timeline for the new expansion, but the push is a very big deal, because it has no intention of hitting it, just to get the big bump in expansion announcements. Activisions flaws have continued to develop into new members that provide a protection for Bobby Kotick and stock is declining. The industry will be afraid of not associating with Activision titles, yet if it don’t manage to carry them in their digital stores, not wasting their money, but making money out of what it costs to buy. The legal groups will stop their infighting and pissing contests to bring serious charges if they will put a stop. Kotick and some large portions of the board are replaced. If FFXIV aren’t for the first time – it doesn’t stand to cope with complication of server, and now it’s a reliable/dependable game, and the industry is the cheapest game. Elder Scrolls rolled along, announced a new class – and a much needed break from the “ZOMG SAVE TAMRIEL”. The expansion of Guild Wars 2 and Guild Wars 2s was unveiled to mixed results. And everyone will love Cantha and the new specs, but it will not be able to complete the customs on the expansion. Everybody will agree that the implementation of fishing is new, fresh and full of fun, but not enough. A marquee feature for an expansion is not enough. ANet will hint at something else big in the works and either bury the lede or accidentally scoop the head. All Funcom titles continue to become Funcomd. Elite Dangerous does something to make up for a lackluster launch of Odyssey and earn the good-will of spaceships. Star Citizen runs from time to time in an NFT vessel. Even if there are any signs of success, the real difference is between time and time. New World continues to make mistakes as if it is nothing new, not just to blame the industrial development. It continues to see impulsive success while trying to figure out what it wants when it grows up. Crowfall receives a maintenance mode announcement in Q1, while Artcraft announces a new MMO in Q2, earning community rage. Camelot Unchained continues to sluggish in development purgatory and pushes a path to 2023. A completely unexpected MMO burst onto the scene and gets everyone excited, but it doesn’t plan to put out until 2027. We have a few more Eastern temports that small minority of the community will declare to be the Second Coming and destroy whatever-the-game-du-jour is. This game runs by a predictable motion until you lie under your desk and get pressed and sobbing, a quiet ride. Brianna Royce (@nbrianna, blog):So 2022 is Guild Wars 2s year to lose. End of Dragons will make an enormous success for the franchise, and it seems like it isn’t really the tentpole feature where people thought it was going to be as a little bigger. ArenaNet must just keep the landing and then continue the climb for the rest of the year. I think it’ll pull it off. I don’t expect World of Warcraft to be so lucky. What should’ve been a major expansion year for the game will see it merely try to stanch the bleeding with some more accessible but still mistaken patches to a flopped Shadowlands. It will boost from WOTLK in Classic, and a boost from a delayed expansion, too. Just put on that announcement for the PAX East and the launch for 2023. Let’s stop believing that Ion Hazzikostas can quit the team a bit and be replaced by someone you have never heard of. Even though union efforts are growing, Bobby Kotick won’t let the hint hint become a private island. I tried to predict WoW Console last year and whiffed, but I’ll predict it again for 2022. New World will announce a pay-out-out, a console-port and an optional subscription. And by bringing back a lot of players and worming into a steady spot in the top five MOMOs, pushing Black Desert out. As for Lost Ark, it will launch a much better path than most people think, but it won’t be as big as New World. Elder Scrolls Online already said it will shake things up next year and tried to set some new expectations. The second class does not start with one-chapter cadence; but the third installment is going to be a better chance of solving problems by adding a big crow, with its role in creating new guilds in the midst of a large dinning. This year, I have no expectation. I don’t expect bold movement from Ashes, Pantheon or Camelot Unchained. I don’t think that Crowfall will have been going to summer. Elite Dangerous will go into de facto maintenance mode. Star Citizen will obviously not come. We won’t hear anything new about Daybreaks in-development or EverQuest, but finally we’ll get more information about LOTROs console launch. Crimson Desert will be delayed all the time. We’re not going to hear complaints about ArcheAge 2. Gamigos Fractured won’t make 2022.Palia and Nightingale will both hit early access and not be a lot like anything but a good idea. Albion Online will be released on consoles and continue to grow. One of the largest 5 players is trying to go head-to-head on crypto, to be dunked on by the players and resign. Carlo Lacsina(@UltraMudkipEX, YouTube, Twitch): Well probably start seeing very little news on the new Runeterra MMO. I doubt that this will be anything solid, but Riot will certainly continue to build stronger lore pieces with Legends of Runeterra and other Riot Forge games slated for 2022 release. FFXIV continues its patch cycle, but it’s best known that the main update is that it’ll be the first major update since it is the first in the entire history of the game that will have a new storyline.Ill likely end up disappointed because it’ll probably just start another 10-year storyline. Guild Wars 2 will have a strong year because of End of Dragons. If the year’s end year will begin, we’ll see a possible Guild Wars 3 plan. Elyon will find a niche audience and pass happily. After the Overwatch League’s early build of Overwatch 2, the Overwatch community could have access to it, too. Folks worry that the quality of the pro games won’t be as good as the competition if the competitors can’t practice solos.I predict that we’ll get a bit older this year than Overwatch 2. This, or they end OWL. Black Desert Online will continue to improve its formula; it will become easier to work with the Enchant System, giving players more newbies and giving a chance average players to read content. How can people build a playable WildStar emu and make a community grow! Maybe it’ll be the year I come to reunite with my long-lost character, Gyozalynn. Chris Neal (@wolfyseyes, blog): I don’t seem to like this, so I’ll just predict if we are going to enter the other worlds in Final Fantasy XIV and call it a day. Aren’t prophets or reactionaries? Eliot Lefebvre (@Eliot Lefebvre blog):World of Warcraft announces its next expansion in February, with a lot of break glass in case of emergencies like Alliance and Horde being able to group up and some major status quo shifts. Despite that, the player reaction is still decidedly mixed. The games developers haven’t bought the goodwill required to provide all the money to think that its going to actually work at this time. Although Hazzikostas was out, he didn’t show his face very often. The expansion is also delayed until 2023, meaning that concerns about lack of content always matter to everyone. Final Fantasy XIV reaches its server’s needs and Endwalker is overset with major patches occurring almost as fast as possible owing to the various delays the game’s experienced. Island Sanctuaries are not homes like many people, and the real housing market is prompting consternation. The game finally adds more servers and people like it, however, the most serious congestion arose. The Elder Scrolls Online has been in a couple of years with its expansions failing to connect directly with fans, but in 2022 they nail it and people all like them again. It was a while ago, but the new additions really attract everyone’s attention and remind everyone why this game is excellent. It does not draw from an earlier title in the franchise. Guild Wars 2 launches End of Dragons with a big bag. On the other hand, actual new maps are praised for their work and they are both more than powerful people. On the other hand, server stability isn’t great. The story is widely criticized for not working on purpose, and that the real story is hardly visible as it was hardly visible in the background. That being said, the game is still net positive. Having some bugs and kinks been worked out, people are happy with the expansion, even if a lot of people still don’t really enjoy making fishing an important activity. The Black Desert has been up in 2022 with a visible sign and a sign of the black desert. The poor and weak, the poor whose lands are destroying the economy. No worries, Crimson desert remains vague until the end of the year. Star Citizen continues to delay and push back timetables for everything. It brings money in, but slow. At least one object was automatically scaled back, a sign of trouble in the game. The NFT scam (which is a scam) is beginning to lose steam in 2022, thankfully, as the high-profile people turn to it as a clearly and obvious scam. It’s a smuggling man and a terrible man. At least one Kickstarted project fell in love in 2022. Crowfall shutters until mid-year, despite ArtCraft insisting that things were still going fine for a while. Next project of the studio’s will have a new look, and the experience is actually more conventional than traditional PvE; from Crowfall, it repurposes old money and old systems. I want to tell him it’s wrong. Blue Protocol finally gets some updates. They look perfectly okay. People who don’t care keep their heart on. Star Wars: The Old Republic is opening its expansion to critical acceptance and a lot of buzz. To be correct, to the contrary. At least one game of a kind sunsets the year on it. In fact, we don’t have big-health titles for the whole team. Someone announces a new Transformers Online game. I get very excited to hear that. I’ll actually sleep well for an average night. As I prepare myself for this years prediction run, I looked back through my memory years passed. For 2015, I wrote, Landmark is beginning to launch after a long open beta and then EverQuest Next is in the coming weeks. Oops. Unfortunately it wasn’t true that this opening of old wounds helped you predict things. Then again, I had a huge number of games. MMOs and RPGs and WTHs will be spawning like alien pod critters take over the planet made me laugh. Even though I never got to play a WTH, I did not have to get a chance to play this one. I can do that. Whats the worst would have happened? Is that true? Please confess that thinking. Here are my 2022 predictions (or curses you can decide) that I am going to make sure you don’t miss the curse.\nSurvival games will continue, with many new ones joining the ranks. Most will be small. I’ll stumble into an obscure one and adore it! Funcoms DUNE will be out in Early Access or some form of closed beta so that people can spin it (literally, with vehicles). ARK 2 could possibly get up by the end of the year, a launch will at least be announced, but we know how WildCard is with ARK launches. Continually, Conan Exiles will acquire new content, from DLCs to a new/expanded map. As long as Funcom is working on its DUNE and Conan the Barbarians, nothing will happen to Secret World Legends again. At least it won’t disappear. If we’re lucky, there will be a cute spin-off title for Halloween, but I wouldn’t speak for myself. Moons of Madness are very cool. A Conan ChopChop arrives. The whole thing must be done! I need that cuteness. Star Citizen is not at the start of the show. In some places, it’s a sad and unexpected sunset that takes people off. GW2s expansion won’t spark any buzz as he did Path of Fire, but it’ll do some good. Everybody is going to love the siege turtles. The best strategy for the year-long campaign was to focus on orcs. They’re not a bad boy. The second choice is the elves, but the elves are already overdone so much, so let’s continue the less humane human of humanoids. (Friend says Redguard lets see whos right. The new campaign will introduce at least one more companion, and is ideal if it’s a ton! Hi-Rez keeps improving, thereby increasing its image. Another unprofitable company will continue to spiral down no matter what money it makes. Do you have any new weapons? Seriously? Seriously. We will be doing a lot more good things thanks to the kindness and generosity of our gaming community at large, and sharing it on Massively Uplifting! The gaming is evil tale is silent a bit while the positives continue to spread. Mo plays a tutu. The project with a special Stream Team will work. They won’t be wearing tutus, I guess. The AQ3D combines weekly content and some new moglins to adore, but still continues to develop a unique feature again. We are going to be back in the future. Sam Kash (@thesamkash): 2021 had good releases, bad delays and bad-will. We already have a couple of expansions and updates slated for February (the best of months) – but I suspect half of them get delayed. Guild Wars 2s End of Dragons will spawn a strong victory. I don’t think we see a huge increase in new players, but I think that it’ll bring a lot of old players back into the fold for the better part of the year. Hopefully the devs make an update of Life World sometime in the middle of the year. This update will be the second most beneficial for the players. Blizzard will have an enormous upheaval. Eventually, the other shoe will fall this year, and it will begin to do good on its workers and players. It will be a little change in direction, but I think it’ll make it right. I think that Overwatch 2 will never be the first thing to be canceled, and instead it will be an extension or a plethora of changes that can be changed to Overwatch. Elder Scrolls will finally add PC play to Game Pass, and I will join the game and give it a chance. I can’t actually pay for it separately when its available for the Xbox with Game Pass. Camelot Unchained will end up dropping the NDA! It’s the year. I feel that. Ignorances and crypto heroes are all coming from the beginning. We continue seeing the torrent of games, that may be the exception of those chips that make up their money. But now it will surely get a lot of attention: the logical reason is that there is no more room for the more twisted elements of the games. Tyler Edwards (blog):New World will continue to struggle for about another six months, and then things will start to get worse. The number that he had was at launch won’t return, but it keeps an excess of people in order to keep on track. Two new weapons and multiple new weapons will be built into the new universe in 2022, the group finder and the mount. Mounts require some effort to unlock and upgrade, and they are not something everybody can just get immediately. In that case, there will be controversy. Any Lost Ark, the End of Dragons and the Legacy of the Sith will all launch on their planned February release date or shortly after them. All will be received reasonably well, but none will be blockbuster hits. Elyon will disappear to obscurity, and it wouldn’t surprise me if I saw a sunset announced before the year is over. The new tv and console version of Lord of the Rings is expected to be canceled before a light day comes. To my own surprise, Neither Wolcen nor Iron Harvest will resolve the cliff-hangers that their stories were on. Star Trek Online is going to see some tie-ins related to Star Trek: Prodigy, but it will continue to be strangely lacking in significant pieces of this film. In the next chapter, the German army will introduce a new weapon type, most likely the oft-rumored single-hand melee + offhand magic skill line. A fad has started fizzing at the end of the year, but its reputations are not recurrent. Corepunk will not fully launch. But it might be possible that we don’t have a kind of open beta, or an early exit. The devs finally can get the game acquiesced and offer them PvE servers. However, the reception of the game will be mixed. Palia will continue to build strong buzz, but not open to the public in any way. World of Warcraft is going to announce its next expansion sometime in the first six months of the year. This will shake the game formula much and probably even allow alliance and Horde players to play together in at least some content. Hopefully, it will eventually prove the story. I think that even a business model change can be done, but I’ve got no idea why. No wonder the new feature of Overwatch is going to have a lot of success. However, the high delays and the general negativity around Blizzard will smother the hype around what would otherwise be an exciting game. Bobby Kotick won’t become the CEO of Activision-Blizzard until 2022. Despite that, he may be keeping an position in the company and/or be given the most golden of parachutes. It won’t feel like it is the justice we all want. The MassivelyOP team gathers an annual feast for you.

Andrew Ross (@dengarsw):I think Gamigo will continue to make many of us miss Trion’s glory days more so than the days we do now. Final Fantasy XIV has become much worse in the future as World of Warcraft does not do worse. Crowfall has finally started, but I think it’s not only worth the money it costed, it’s also worth the wait.
I’ll be a little optimistic and say that there will be something big at Activision-Blizzard before 2022. Either Kotick can’t leave, or a large group of devs will go off again, though maybe to a former Blizz head studio (Kaplan, where’s the company?). Having said that, Riot Games could actually turn into the next Blizzard, especially if Arcane was successful on Netflix and how hard Ruined King made them endure the MOBA community.
With so much damage and so little to show, it won’t be winning back the fans it burned in 2020. Unless they somehow can gain some devs who could do more than follow the online tutorials, they can make something better than the dev made during their first attempt at a 3-D game (remind the team to stop talking big and just do the work).
And for disappointments, I’ll say that Star Citizen isn’t coming out this year. If you don’t believe me, please. Please?
VR probably sees more games built, but on larger scales, too it is likely that its more expensive they can. The same applies to most nantic-based AR games in location. On that front, I think that the team will release Transformers, announce a new partnership game (most likely with Nintendo) and either shutter or announce a shutter for Pikmin Bloom, though it can last until 2023. I mean, it’s not about community day anymore than Pokemon GOs, but on community day. As for the Pooke-System itself, I still think that it would be a crossover with Pokemon Legends: Arceus, continue to drip a gap in the Pokedex up to eight generations in-game now, and tease other AR-intensive capabilities that much-needed use can end immediately after the novelty of them wears off in minutes/hours. In fact, I’ll predict that we won’t get Kecleon until Niantic adds a new AR feature to the game.
Andy McAdams: Although the leadership continues to affirm that the lol Raid for GTFO are the only people who matter in the playerbase, the success will continue to decline. The Players Council, which consist mainly of the most powerful people to say anything critical and cutting edge raiders, has the most powerful outcome, which will inevitably deliver something so deeply stupid that most of the MMOsphere is disbeliefd while Ion and friends look disturbed and ask themselves who could have predicted that this profoundly stupid thing we did would have negative consequences? Those who won’t be doing their best will continue to be ahead of the game while driving a lot of competition and expressing their own inner piety, instead of what the community values. A new existing existential threat will succeed, in making sure that we win over the death story will get predictable results. Blizzard announces an early release timeline for the new expansion, but the push is a very big deal, because it has no intention of hitting it, just to get the big bump in expansion announcements.
Activisions flaws have continued to develop into new members that provide a protection for Bobby Kotick and stock is declining. The industry will be afraid of not associating with Activision titles, yet if it don’t manage to carry them in their digital stores, not wasting their money, but making money out of what it costs to buy. The legal groups will stop their infighting and pissing contests to bring serious charges if they will put a stop. Kotick and some large portions of the board are replaced.
If FFXIV aren’t for the first time – it doesn’t stand to cope with complication of server, and now it’s a reliable/dependable game, and the industry is the cheapest game.
Elder Scrolls rolled along, announced a new class – and a much needed break from the “ZOMG SAVE TAMRIEL”.
The expansion of Guild Wars 2 and Guild Wars 2s was unveiled to mixed results. And everyone will love Cantha and the new specs, but it will not be able to complete the customs on the expansion. Everybody will agree that the implementation of fishing is new, fresh and full of fun, but not enough. A marquee feature for an expansion is not enough. ANet will hint at something else big in the works and either bury the lede or accidentally scoop the head.
All Funcom titles continue to become Funcomd.
Elite Dangerous does something to make up for a lackluster launch of Odyssey and earn the good-will of spaceships.
Star Citizen runs from time to time in an NFT vessel. Even if there are any signs of success, the real difference is between time and time.
New World continues to make mistakes as if it is nothing new, not just to blame the industrial development. It continues to see impulsive success while trying to figure out what it wants when it grows up.
Crowfall receives a maintenance mode announcement in Q1, while Artcraft announces a new MMO in Q2, earning community rage.
Camelot Unchained continues to sluggish in development purgatory and pushes a path to 2023.
A completely unexpected MMO burst onto the scene and gets everyone excited, but it doesn’t plan to put out until 2027.
We have a few more Eastern temports that small minority of the community will declare to be the Second Coming and destroy whatever-the-game-du-jour is. This game runs by a predictable motion until you lie under your desk and get pressed and sobbing, a quiet ride.
Brianna Royce (@nbrianna, blog):So 2022 is Guild Wars 2s year to lose. End of Dragons will make an enormous success for the franchise, and it seems like it isn’t really the tentpole feature where people thought it was going to be as a little bigger. ArenaNet must just keep the landing and then continue the climb for the rest of the year. I think it’ll pull it off.
I don’t expect World of Warcraft to be so lucky. What should’ve been a major expansion year for the game will see it merely try to stanch the bleeding with some more accessible but still mistaken patches to a flopped Shadowlands. It will boost from WOTLK in Classic, and a boost from a delayed expansion, too. Just put on that announcement for the PAX East and the launch for 2023. Let’s stop believing that Ion Hazzikostas can quit the team a bit and be replaced by someone you have never heard of. Even though union efforts are growing, Bobby Kotick won’t let the hint hint become a private island. I tried to predict WoW Console last year and whiffed, but I’ll predict it again for 2022.
New World will announce a pay-out-out, a console-port and an optional subscription. And by bringing back a lot of players and worming into a steady spot in the top five MOMOs, pushing Black Desert out. As for Lost Ark, it will launch a much better path than most people think, but it won’t be as big as New World.
Elder Scrolls Online already said it will shake things up next year and tried to set some new expectations. The second class does not start with one-chapter cadence; but the third installment is going to be a better chance of solving problems by adding a big crow, with its role in creating new guilds in the midst of a large dinning.
This year, I have no expectation. I don’t expect bold movement from Ashes, Pantheon or Camelot Unchained. I don’t think that Crowfall will have been going to summer. Elite Dangerous will go into de facto maintenance mode. Star Citizen will obviously not come.
We won’t hear anything new about Daybreaks in-development or EverQuest, but finally we’ll get more information about LOTROs console launch. Crimson Desert will be delayed all the time. We’re not going to hear complaints about ArcheAge 2. Gamigos Fractured won’t make 2022.Palia and Nightingale will both hit early access and not be a lot like anything but a good idea. Albion Online will be released on consoles and continue to grow.
One of the largest 5 players is trying to go head-to-head on crypto, to be dunked on by the players and resign.
Carlo Lacsina(@UltraMudkipEX, YouTube, Twitch): Well probably start seeing very little news on the new Runeterra MMO. I doubt that this will be anything solid, but Riot will certainly continue to build stronger lore pieces with Legends of Runeterra and other Riot Forge games slated for 2022 release.
FFXIV continues its patch cycle, but it’s best known that the main update is that it’ll be the first major update since it is the first in the entire history of the game that will have a new storyline.Ill likely end up disappointed because it’ll probably just start another 10-year storyline.
Guild Wars 2 will have a strong year because of End of Dragons. If the year’s end year will begin, we’ll see a possible Guild Wars 3 plan.
Elyon will find a niche audience and pass happily.
After the Overwatch League’s early build of Overwatch 2, the Overwatch community could have access to it, too. Folks worry that the quality of the pro games won’t be as good as the competition if the competitors can’t practice solos.I predict that we’ll get a bit older this year than Overwatch 2. This, or they end OWL.
Black Desert Online will continue to improve its formula; it will become easier to work with the Enchant System, giving players more newbies and giving a chance average players to read content.
How can people build a playable WildStar emu and make a community grow! Maybe it’ll be the year I come to reunite with my long-lost character, Gyozalynn.
Chris Neal (@wolfyseyes, blog): I don’t seem to like this, so I’ll just predict if we are going to enter the other worlds in Final Fantasy XIV and call it a day. Aren’t prophets or reactionaries?
Eliot Lefebvre (@Eliot Lefebvre blog):World of Warcraft announces its next expansion in February, with a lot of break glass in case of emergencies like Alliance and Horde being able to group up and some major status quo shifts. Despite that, the player reaction is still decidedly mixed. The games developers haven’t bought the goodwill required to provide all the money to think that its going to actually work at this time. Although Hazzikostas was out, he didn’t show his face very often. The expansion is also delayed until 2023, meaning that concerns about lack of content always matter to everyone.
Final Fantasy XIV reaches its server’s needs and Endwalker is overset with major patches occurring almost as fast as possible owing to the various delays the game’s experienced. Island Sanctuaries are not homes like many people, and the real housing market is prompting consternation. The game finally adds more servers and people like it, however, the most serious congestion arose.
The Elder Scrolls Online has been in a couple of years with its expansions failing to connect directly with fans, but in 2022 they nail it and people all like them again. It was a while ago, but the new additions really attract everyone’s attention and remind everyone why this game is excellent. It does not draw from an earlier title in the franchise.
Guild Wars 2 launches End of Dragons with a big bag. On the other hand, actual new maps are praised for their work and they are both more than powerful people. On the other hand, server stability isn’t great. The story is widely criticized for not working on purpose, and that the real story is hardly visible as it was hardly visible in the background. That being said, the game is still net positive. Having some bugs and kinks been worked out, people are happy with the expansion, even if a lot of people still don’t really enjoy making fishing an important activity.
The Black Desert has been up in 2022 with a visible sign and a sign of the black desert. The poor and weak, the poor whose lands are destroying the economy. No worries, Crimson desert remains vague until the end of the year.
Star Citizen continues to delay and push back timetables for everything. It brings money in, but slow. At least one object was automatically scaled back, a sign of trouble in the game.
The NFT scam (which is a scam) is beginning to lose steam in 2022, thankfully, as the high-profile people turn to it as a clearly and obvious scam. It’s a smuggling man and a terrible man.
At least one Kickstarted project fell in love in 2022.
Crowfall shutters until mid-year, despite ArtCraft insisting that things were still going fine for a while. Next project of the studio’s will have a new look, and the experience is actually more conventional than traditional PvE; from Crowfall, it repurposes old money and old systems. I want to tell him it’s wrong.
Blue Protocol finally gets some updates. They look perfectly okay. People who don’t care keep their heart on.
Star Wars: The Old Republic is opening its expansion to critical acceptance and a lot of buzz. To be correct, to the contrary.
At least one game of a kind sunsets the year on it. In fact, we don’t have big-health titles for the whole team.
Someone announces a new Transformers Online game. I get very excited to hear that.
I’ll actually sleep well for an average night.
As I prepare myself for this years prediction run, I looked back through my memory years passed. For 2015, I wrote, Landmark is beginning to launch after a long open beta and then EverQuest Next is in the coming weeks. Oops. Unfortunately it wasn’t true that this opening of old wounds helped you predict things. Then again, I had a huge number of games. MMOs and RPGs and WTHs will be spawning like alien pod critters take over the planet made me laugh. Even though I never got to play a WTH, I did not have to get a chance to play this one.
I can do that. Whats the worst would have happened? Is that true? Please confess that thinking. Here are my 2022 predictions (or curses you can decide) that I am going to make sure you don’t miss the curse.</p><ol><li>Survival games will continue, with many new ones joining the ranks. Most will be small. I’ll stumble into an obscure one and adore it! Funcoms DUNE will be out in Early Access or some form of closed beta so that people can spin it (literally, with vehicles). ARK 2 could possibly get up by the end of the year, a launch will at least be announced, but we know how WildCard is with ARK launches. Continually, Conan Exiles will acquire new content, from DLCs to a new/expanded map.</li><li>As long as Funcom is working on its DUNE and Conan the Barbarians, nothing will happen to Secret World Legends again. At least it won’t disappear. If we’re lucky, there will be a cute spin-off title for Halloween, but I wouldn’t speak for myself. Moons of Madness are very cool.</li><li>A Conan ChopChop arrives. The whole thing must be done! I need that cuteness.</li><li>Star Citizen is not at the start of the show.</li><li>In some places, it’s a sad and unexpected sunset that takes people off.</li><li>GW2s expansion won’t spark any buzz as he did Path of Fire, but it’ll do some good. Everybody is going to love the siege turtles.</li><li>The best strategy for the year-long campaign was to focus on orcs. They’re not a bad boy. The second choice is the elves, but the elves are already overdone so much, so let’s continue the less humane human of humanoids. (Friend says Redguard lets see whos right. The new campaign will introduce at least one more companion, and is ideal if it’s a ton!</li><li>Hi-Rez keeps improving, thereby increasing its image. Another unprofitable company will continue to spiral down no matter what money it makes.</li><li>Do you have any new weapons? Seriously? Seriously.</li><li>We will be doing a lot more good things thanks to the kindness and generosity of our gaming community at large, and sharing it on Massively Uplifting! The gaming is evil tale is silent a bit while the positives continue to spread.</li><li>Mo plays a tutu.</li><li>The project with a special Stream Team will work. They won’t be wearing tutus, I guess.</li><li>The AQ3D combines weekly content and some new moglins to adore, but still continues to develop a unique feature again. We are going to be back in the future.
Sam Kash (@thesamkash): 2021 had good releases, bad delays and bad-will. We already have a couple of expansions and updates slated for February (the best of months) – but I suspect half of them get delayed.
Guild Wars 2s End of Dragons will spawn a strong victory. I don’t think we see a huge increase in new players, but I think that it’ll bring a lot of old players back into the fold for the better part of the year. Hopefully the devs make an update of Life World sometime in the middle of the year. This update will be the second most beneficial for the players.
Blizzard will have an enormous upheaval. Eventually, the other shoe will fall this year, and it will begin to do good on its workers and players. It will be a little change in direction, but I think it’ll make it right.
I think that Overwatch 2 will never be the first thing to be canceled, and instead it will be an extension or a plethora of changes that can be changed to Overwatch.
Elder Scrolls will finally add PC play to Game Pass, and I will join the game and give it a chance. I can’t actually pay for it separately when its available for the Xbox with Game Pass.
Camelot Unchained will end up dropping the NDA! It’s the year. I feel that.
Ignorances and crypto heroes are all coming from the beginning. We continue seeing the torrent of games, that may be the exception of those chips that make up their money. But now it will surely get a lot of attention: the logical reason is that there is no more room for the more twisted elements of the games.
Tyler Edwards (blog):New World will continue to struggle for about another six months, and then things will start to get worse. The number that he had was at launch won’t return, but it keeps an excess of people in order to keep on track. Two new weapons and multiple new weapons will be built into the new universe in 2022, the group finder and the mount. Mounts require some effort to unlock and upgrade, and they are not something everybody can just get immediately. In that case, there will be controversy.
Any Lost Ark, the End of Dragons and the Legacy of the Sith will all launch on their planned February release date or shortly after them. All will be received reasonably well, but none will be blockbuster hits.
Elyon will disappear to obscurity, and it wouldn’t surprise me if I saw a sunset announced before the year is over.
The new tv and console version of Lord of the Rings is expected to be canceled before a light day comes.
To my own surprise, Neither Wolcen nor Iron Harvest will resolve the cliff-hangers that their stories were on.
Star Trek Online is going to see some tie-ins related to Star Trek: Prodigy, but it will continue to be strangely lacking in significant pieces of this film.
In the next chapter, the German army will introduce a new weapon type, most likely the oft-rumored single-hand melee + offhand magic skill line.
A fad has started fizzing at the end of the year, but its reputations are not recurrent.
Corepunk will not fully launch. But it might be possible that we don’t have a kind of open beta, or an early exit. The devs finally can get the game acquiesced and offer them PvE servers. However, the reception of the game will be mixed.
Palia will continue to build strong buzz, but not open to the public in any way.
World of Warcraft is going to announce its next expansion sometime in the first six months of the year. This will shake the game formula much and probably even allow alliance and Horde players to play together in at least some content. Hopefully, it will eventually prove the story. I think that even a business model change can be done, but I’ve got no idea why.
No wonder the new feature of Overwatch is going to have a lot of success. However, the high delays and the general negativity around Blizzard will smother the hype around what would otherwise be an exciting game.
Bobby Kotick won’t become the CEO of Activision-Blizzard until 2022. Despite that, he may be keeping an position in the company and/or be given the most golden of parachutes. It won’t feel like it is the justice we all want.
The MassivelyOP team gathers an annual feast for you.
