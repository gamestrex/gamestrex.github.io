Multiplayer Stability\nUsing Daniels substitute skin won’t block the game.\nSeasonal Challenges\nThis is a very visible, active, and reliable measure of Progress for Seasonal Challenges.\nWeapons\nBug Fixes Riot Shield blocks front-facing damage, but bullets won’t penetrate. The Firefight Blueprint was fixed to remove light from the front and eye area and some parts of the optic. The K98K Hunter incentive skin doesn’t allow the gun to keep the iron sights up, instead of the attached scope. Top Break is not going to throw reload on top! Gleaned 9 rounds, reducing the total amount of ammo by 7 m x 7 x 7. Identifyed multiple problems by passing a handwritten note of joy. Weapon animations have been polished and some glitches have been resolved. Balancing Challenges Panzerfaust Challenge has changed from ariel to alans to longshots. Weapons Art 7744 – Type 6196 and 41009 – Type 99 – Type 99 \u0026 Kar98K \u0026 Type 99. Using a lighter calibre magazine, these weapons can now become self-taught when landing a rifle, and can use one-Shot-Kills when landing a handgun. Top Break This won’t reduce damage anymore, but range reduction has increased. Rifle with anti-tank weapon Gorenko. The default scope can no longer tense the player view in the game-game with the bayonet. Attachments When Reach Kit Perk is applied, Bayonet reduced the flow of Melee into a single piece. Camos Double Barrel Corrections were made for the Death Artist Challenge to say 16 Gauge Mag instead of 12 Gauge Mag. Assault 3:5:8 am Is 12:30 am I? Camos have a good mood now. M1 Garand Camos are showing signs of a good progression now. Cross-progression: follow-up. Master Ribbons data from the Cold War will now be imported and stored in the Vanguard Collection. Now the threat of the city of Warcraft continues in the city of Vanguard.\nKillstreaks\nMortar Barrage Added damage caused by the Mortar Barrage Flare! Mortar Barrage has been tweaked to make deployment less difficult.\nMaps\nParadise Fixed several unloadable exploits. Fixed certain hazes, like a wild shot when jumping against ramped walls. Radar Fixed a situation that destroyed some doors. Fixed out of-map spawns and exploits. Desert Siege Spinning to reduce the number of spawns closest to enemies enables them to fight spawned on the back of them. Fixed the issue of a render that caused intense fog for some players to play. The problem with blinking texture has been fixed in several locations. Bocage The problem with bullet penetration for certain walls has been fixed. Unlike the MK2 Frag Grenade blast radius, players shouldn’t be protected by walls. Red Star Fixed a bug with lighting effects after the player went above the map to a light point. Berlin Distracting and graphically incorrect shadows no longer appear under light fixtures. Numa Numa Removed invisible geo in Numa that blocked bullets in midair. Gavutu Fixed the problem in which a invisible wall remained after its destruction. Demanysk Demolition and Tactics perks now serve as the basis for the purpose of operation. New York City, San Bernardino, Saato, Poissons, Das Haus. Fixed off-road exploits.\nModes\nControl The control is over now. Champion Hill Players won’t fall in love with champions-inspired duos, so the entire game will have to be closed. Players now have access to Scoreboard and Spectate Mode.\nUI/UX/UI/UIX.\nThere are no more errors in getting people to say that they don’t have Crossplay permission when attempting to add other consoles to a party. A new whitehead is printed with every Prestige level-up, and the XP bars should reflect Prestige progression. Two universal Prestige icon have been fixed.\nThis update escaped several bugs plaguing players in multiplayer. Camo has now taken the STG44, M1 Garand, Panzerfaust and the double-barrel shotgun to make sure that he is running right now. The challenge for a prestige system has also been fixed, because the players can see their seasonal challenges and accurately track their seasonal trends. Sledgehammer released the game modes mode Control in public matches of Vanguard and fixed a lot of other exploits. Players hope that Control is stable than the first one released.\nCampaign Fixed a character blocking on the Lady Nightingale level due to an irritated character.\nZombies Objectives\nPurge Seeing the low light areas is getting more visible. The progress bar no longer overlaps various notifications such as Challenge Completions, Rank Ups, Weapon Level Ups and more. Professor Krafft will acknowledge Purge objective completions now.\nCovenants\nBrimstone The player’s downed a player doesn’t damage the zombie anymore. Brimstone was fixed, but now it’s only available to shoot zombies. Dead Accurate Launchers work according to Dead Accurate Covenant. Swift Vengeance With the use of this Covenant, the new version of Swift Vengeance is updated as much as possible. The Knives are now working according to the Swift Vengeance Treat.\nWeapons\nExplained an issue where a weapon obtained from crates was briefly displayed when dropped. The issue was, where some Mystery Box weapons were made available, the magazine disassembled from the weapon. The game is where players couldn’t play with their preferred custom reticles. An issue that falsely identified some of Launcher damage as critical hits.\nGameplay\nPortals provide players the opportunity to visit each destination before they decide to return to the same location. There were many exploits which prevented players from taking damage from zombies.\nChallenges\nMelee Camo Challenges were adjusted to count kills, not eliminations, with the exception of Sturmkrieger Challenges.\nUI\nZone names are added in zones where they were absent from the map. The scoreboard now shows the player in the correct position. The problem was solved with a multi-functional scoreboard.\nAudio\nIt was focused on an issue where the operators and the announcer could share their voice.\nSubtitles / Text.\nIf players choose the English language language, there are many fixes for subtitles. Two different problems will be solved when players select German language. Multiple fixes for text descriptions when players select Brazilian Portuguese language setting. An optimisation of subtitles when players select Polish language settings.\nStability\nWe discussed a problem where once someone would take a player to the main Zombies menu, when you copy and replace loading-outs. There are many stability fixes.\nThat is all of the changes mentioned in the notes for the Dec. 15 update in Vanguard. Festive Fervor will introduce new content on Dec. 17 in the form of blueprints, mode and challenge. That event is live on Dec. 17th in the States of the West and the United States of America.\n","wordCount":"1110","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-11-10T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Julia Stephens"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/call-of-duty-vanguard-dec-15-update-the-patch-notes/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"gamestrex","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gamestrex.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gamestrex.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gamestrex.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Call Of Duty Vanguard Dec 15 Update The Patch Notes</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 10, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1110 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Julia Stephens</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#vanguard-dec-15-patch-notes>Vanguard Dec. 15 patch notes.</a><ul><li><a href=#multiplayer>Multiplayer</a></li><li><a href=#campaign>Campaign</a></li><li><a href=#zombies>Zombies</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><hr><p>A full patch note for the Dec. 15 update in Vanguard can be seen here below and on Sledgehammers.</p><h2 id=vanguard-dec-15-patch-notes>Vanguard Dec. 15 patch notes.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#vanguard-dec-15-patch-notes>#</a></h2><h3 id=multiplayer>Multiplayer<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#multiplayer>#</a></h3><p>Stability</p><p>Using Daniels substitute skin won’t block the game.</p><p>Seasonal Challenges</p><p>This is a very visible, active, and reliable measure of Progress for Seasonal Challenges.</p><p>Weapons</p><p>Bug Fixes Riot Shield blocks front-facing damage, but bullets won’t penetrate.
