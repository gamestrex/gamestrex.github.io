Guardians of the Galaxy full soundtrack is an 80s meme dream. Marvels Guardians of the Galaxy: Basic tips and tricks for the beginner.\nThe first chapter of the series, Risisome Gamble. There are two outfits you can find during the Guardians of the Galaxy opening chapter. Star-Lord, Rocket, and Groot are split on board. The Rockets’ monster-luring devices are moving around their section of the quarantine area while Gamora and Drax tackle a different area.\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy outfits are a three-dimensional team. Eventually you will get into the ramp and take the fork. Rocket insists the left is the correct path. Go down the right path. Youll know that you did the right thing when you chastises for it. Turn around once you reach the goal–on-line and get back into the point-off. Youll see an area you’ll go from left to left. Inside will be a bundle of components, and an outfit called the Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) from the Rockets.\nGroots Guardians of the Galaxy (2014 ) outfit consists of three outfits: Guardians of the Galaxy and Guardians of the Galaxy (2014 ). After you reunited with Groot, you’ll eventually enter an area with a few tunnels. Don’t go much further. Try looking to your right instead of finding a space in the wall that is large enough to crawl through. You will know when you look at the right place if you’re covered in pink gunk. You can find Groots Guardians of the Galaxy outfit for the next day.\nChapter 2. Busted The Guardians are dealing deeply with Ko-Rel and the rest of the Nova Corps. These two outfits are technically possible, but one in the second carries one of them. Don’t worry. The Guardian will return to the Nova Corps station in Chapter 7, with newfound skills to unlock the second outfit.\nStar-Lords Nova-Lord outfit. Star-Lord and Nikki will continue their daring journey through the burning Nova ship. They’ll push on a box to block a firefight against an explosion pipe to stop the fire. This leaves a dialogue option on which to encourag her or take control. You should choose the clothes no matter what the outfit is you wearing. This dialogue exchange lets you know your own situation. Behind Nikki is a thick yellow pipe you can duck under. Get into the Star-Lords outfit and meet Star-Lords outfits. What is the case with the dialogue option, you should encourage Nikki to always side with her whenever there’s time. Let Shell slip her pass-key on you in the future.\nThe cost of the freedom. Now thousands of dollars in debt. Now, the Guardians travel to Lady Hellbenders home to sell the monster queen Groot or Rocket. There are two outfits that you will find while you explore Seknarf 9. The idea of selling that clothing doesn’t influence the finding of these outfits. You have to try selling Groot, but you should always try to sell it. You should also sell Groot if you want to find the outfit in the next chapter.\nThe Guardian of the Galaxy and Gamoras (2014) outfit. After the Guardians fend off jelly monsters for the first time, they’ll have to be out of the fighting pit. Have Drax and Rocket manipulate the area so that you can climb out of the pit. When you walk over the thick forest, turn it back to your right. When you hear the roar loud, you will know what you’re looking for in the right area. You are eventually on the verge of a dark cave and you’ll have to beg your way through a pushload pile of scuts. We’re in the cave until we take a fight. There are two jelly enemies to defeat, and you won’t have the other Guardians at your disposal. Examine the jelly monsters and continue. It’ll look like Gamoras Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) outfit up ahead.\nGroots Five Horsemen of the Apocalypse outfit, Groots. When the Guardians claim the monster cage, Groot will build a bridge up to a cliffside. You should see the outfit box from where you are, but you need to find the hidden path. Follow the bridge and take the left. There’s a shootable gray gunk waiting for the cave’s entrance. You have to use elemental guns to freeze geysers in the cave. Jump up the ice treason to climb out of the cave. On the ridge there are Groots Five Horsemen, who’re dressed like Apocalypse. You can blitz backwards to their fellow Guardians, and you shouldn’t get hurt into that cave.\nChapter 4: Monster Queen. To find the outfits in Chapter 4, you should sell Groot to Lady Hellbender. Selling Rocket will create a new scenario that won’t allow you to sneak through his palace after midnight. If you jump in Chapter 4 from the main menu, you’ll sell Groot entirely.\nDrax’s Guardians of the Galaxy outfit is coming soon. After wandering through the first wave of ill-wishers, the Guardians arrive in the Lady Hellbenders throne room. A new bridge is hidden outside the throne. Head over there and go left and find a Guardian of the Galaxy (Draxs) outfit tucked in the corner.\nFive Horsemen of the Apocalypse outfit are being joined by Rockets, the lions and the parachutes. After riding the elevator down from the Lady Hellbenders throne room, the Guardians will have to sneak past other drunk Hellraisers. If you want to take the steps, turn left and hop over the table. You’ll have to sneak several hellraisers to find a wall you can crouch under. On the other side of this wall is the F-Hattle of the Apocalypse outfit.\nChapter 5: Medicinals or “Sillations” With enough money to pay their fine, the Guardians head back to Nova Corps base to find it empty. The main benefit of this mission is to help Groot find a bathroom.\nDraxs Nova-Corp outfit reunited. Before they get off to Milano, Groot asks if there’s a toilet at the Station Nova Corps. He met unanimously, holding it in. You’ll eventually come to a room where Star-Lord must use his visor to redirect electricity to the door. Reroute the power to the locked door on the left, revealing what Groots was looking for a bathroom. Head into the store, searching for Drax’s Nova Corps outfit. You must have opened the door. Opening the main door triggers rocket to leave the control room.\nGroots Nova Corps outfit was brought together by Groots. Star-Lord eventually will take a helmet off and overhear a number of people talking on the opposite side. The right decision here is to bring down the helmet and not say anything. Nevertheless, the attacker has to fight his way out of the base. He eventually exited the town of a corrupted Nova Corps soldier. Once he has defeated himself, he will enter an orange-glowing room. There’s a lift, where you can jump and get out. Don’t leave yet. The Groots Nova Corps outfit is hidden behind a box on the opposite side of the room.\nChapter 6: Between Rock and Hard Place. Tensions are high when the Guardians arrive on Knowhere. Rocket and Groot left their head. Danrax and Gamora eventually left Star-Lord after talking to Mantis. Now alone, Star-Lord could either gamble all their credit away or go to find Cosmo. One outfit can be found while they travel to Knowhere.\nFeatured Stars Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) outfit. Start the aims when you find a small flight of stairs leading into a pink-laced building. This building is opposite the colorful slot machine. On the left side of the building, children would see a trio of children pointing at each other. If you have problems seeing them, turn off the subtitles and watch Pew-pew, pew-pew. Behind these children is a railing that you can jump on. This lead to a series of red pipes below. Walk left onto the pipes and find the Guardians of the Galaxy outfit by Star-Lord.\nChapter 7.

After the second wave, Rocket will open two doors, and you’ll have to reroute your power so the elevator can move. From the point of view of Rockets, enter the left room to find his Nova Corps outfit. You can find a shaft through the way of Groot to raise the platform.\nGamoras Nova outfit has a military presence. The Guardians will revisit Starlords steps in Chapter 2 to find a secret hideout in Nikkis. You descend stairs with a pool of electrified water at the bottom. The water’s power can be lost by using the Star-Lords shock ammo to recharge. You are watching a series of pipes Gamora can chop down with her sword. Stop trying these pipes so as to find the Gamoras Nova Corps outfit.\nThe Matriarch: Chapter 8: Matriarch: Who will be the matriarch? The first portion of the matriarch will be hard, if you are hunting. Without doubt you won’t need to redo the entire mission sequence from Star-Lords if you have already played through this mission. We have two outfits to find after your first encounter with The Matriarch (which we won’t spoil).\nStars and the Knights in bad Lord outfit. The Guardians dive into what Rocket thought to be toxic warp-drive fluid. They will sludge down a tunnel and emerge safely on the other side. There’s a big box adjacent to that can become used by Drax. Make her place it just outside the tunnel you are left. Call up and discover a hidden room with the Star-Lords’ bad-god outfit. We can’t believe that the other Guardians allow him to dress like this!\nDraxs Cage Match outfit. You’ll descend to the elevator after a skiff sequence. Once the elevator stops, walk in to the back for a Draxs Cage match outfit.\nChapter 9: Diversion. Since you’ll spend all your time on the Milano mission, there are no outfits to find in Chapter nine of Guardians of the Galaxy.\nThis chapter teaches some faith. Drax needs help. There are the Guardians in there to rescue him from a chasm. To find the source of Draxs mind prison, they should however navigate the caves under Lamentis to locate the caves. There are three costumes on this mission.\nGamoras, five Horsemen of the Apocalypse outfit are all in the same outfit. Mantis brings the guards into the huddle below Lamentis.

Hell blow the wallhole, making you one more way. Use a freeze ammo to reopen the poison gas which blocked your path. Next, please let Groot use the lift to take you to the base. The cave walked to the far side of the hill. Rockets is an American team.\nGroots enthusiastical consecutive for enlightenment – the ultimate consequestor-in-famous escalator. When Groot led the Guardians through the dark cave, go into the right until you see a room lightened with purple light. Shimmy through the crack to get out of a Groots anscundation Conquest outfit.\nChapter 11, Mind and Matter, Revelation, and Abrasia. Since you spend the majority of this mission inside the head of Drax, there are no outfits that we can find in Chapter 11 of Guardians of the Galaxy.\nChapter 12 – How to Run on your feet!

If you pre-order the match, they will have this outfit in your inventory. If not keep a close eye after Gamora cut off the wires to move forward. After she cut the wires and you find a wall for Drax to push aside, turn left. You’ll see a green bar from which Star-Lord can use his wind ammo on. The difference between the two sides is the malfunctioning door that Star-Lord can use to stop this. Once the floor becomes clear, you will find a room. On your left is a shootable panel revealing a hole that could be buried by Rocket. When you turn the power off, you can cross quickly. In this room is Groots Optoler.\nGamoras Casual Kill outfit.

Guardians of the Galaxy full soundtrack is an 80s meme dream. Marvels Guardians of the Galaxy: Basic tips and tricks for the beginner.</p><h2 id=the-first-chapter-of-the-series-risisome-gamble>The first chapter of the series, Risisome Gamble.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-first-chapter-of-the-series-risisome-gamble>#</a></h2><p>There are two outfits you can find during the Guardians of the Galaxy opening chapter. Star-Lord, Rocket, and Groot are split on board. The Rockets’ monster-luring devices are moving around their section of the quarantine area while Gamora and Drax tackle a different area.</p><h3 id=the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-outfits-are-a-three-dimensional-team>The Guardians of the Galaxy outfits are a three-dimensional team.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-outfits-are-a-three-dimensional-team>#</a></h3><p>Eventually you will get into the ramp and take the fork. Rocket insists the left is the correct path. Go down the right path. Youll know that you did the right thing when you chastises for it. Turn around once you reach the goal–on-line and get back into the point-off. Youll see an area you’ll go from left to left. Inside will be a bundle of components, and an outfit called the Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) from the Rockets.</p><h3 id=groots-guardians-of-the-galaxy-2014--outfit-consists-of-three-outfits-guardians-of-the-galaxy-and-guardians-of-the-galaxy-2014->Groots Guardians of the Galaxy (2014 ) outfit consists of three outfits: Guardians of the Galaxy and Guardians of the Galaxy (2014 ).<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#groots-guardians-of-the-galaxy-2014--outfit-consists-of-three-outfits-guardians-of-the-galaxy-and-guardians-of-the-galaxy-2014->#</a></h3><p>After you reunited with Groot, you’ll eventually enter an area with a few tunnels. Don’t go much further. Try looking to your right instead of finding a space in the wall that is large enough to crawl through. You will know when you look at the right place if you’re covered in pink gunk. You can find Groots Guardians of the Galaxy outfit for the next day.</p><h2 id=chapter-2-busted>Chapter 2. Busted<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-2-busted>#</a></h2><p>The Guardians are dealing deeply with Ko-Rel and the rest of the Nova Corps. These two outfits are technically possible, but one in the second carries one of them. Don’t worry. The Guardian will return to the Nova Corps station in Chapter 7, with newfound skills to unlock the second outfit.</p><h3 id=star-lords-nova-lord-outfit>Star-Lords Nova-Lord outfit.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#star-lords-nova-lord-outfit>#</a></h3><p>Star-Lord and Nikki will continue their daring journey through the burning Nova ship. They’ll push on a box to block a firefight against an explosion pipe to stop the fire. This leaves a dialogue option on which to encourag her or take control. You should choose the clothes no matter what the outfit is you wearing. This dialogue exchange lets you know your own situation. Behind Nikki is a thick yellow pipe you can duck under. Get into the Star-Lords outfit and meet Star-Lords outfits. What is the case with the dialogue option, you should encourage Nikki to always side with her whenever there’s time. Let Shell slip her pass-key on you in the future.</p><h2 id=the-cost-of-the-freedom>The cost of the freedom.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-cost-of-the-freedom>#</a></h2><p>Now thousands of dollars in debt. Now, the Guardians travel to Lady Hellbenders home to sell the monster queen Groot or Rocket. There are two outfits that you will find while you explore Seknarf 9. The idea of selling that clothing doesn’t influence the finding of these outfits. You have to try selling Groot, but you should always try to sell it. You should also sell Groot if you want to find the outfit in the next chapter.</p><h3 id=the-guardian-of-the-galaxy-and-gamoras-2014-outfit>The Guardian of the Galaxy and Gamoras (2014) outfit.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-guardian-of-the-galaxy-and-gamoras-2014-outfit>#</a></h3><p>After the Guardians fend off jelly monsters for the first time, they’ll have to be out of the fighting pit. Have Drax and Rocket manipulate the area so that you can climb out of the pit. When you walk over the thick forest, turn it back to your right. When you hear the roar loud, you will know what you’re looking for in the right area. You are eventually on the verge of a dark cave and you’ll have to beg your way through a pushload pile of scuts. We’re in the cave until we take a fight. There are two jelly enemies to defeat, and you won’t have the other Guardians at your disposal. Examine the jelly monsters and continue. It’ll look like Gamoras Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) outfit up ahead.</p><h3 id=groots-five-horsemen-of-the-apocalypse-outfit-groots>Groots Five Horsemen of the Apocalypse outfit, Groots.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#groots-five-horsemen-of-the-apocalypse-outfit-groots>#</a></h3><p>When the Guardians claim the monster cage, Groot will build a bridge up to a cliffside. You should see the outfit box from where you are, but you need to find the hidden path. Follow the bridge and take the left. There’s a shootable gray gunk waiting for the cave’s entrance. You have to use elemental guns to freeze geysers in the cave. Jump up the ice treason to climb out of the cave. On the ridge there are Groots Five Horsemen, who’re dressed like Apocalypse. You can blitz backwards to their fellow Guardians, and you shouldn’t get hurt into that cave.</p><h2 id=chapter-4-monster-queen>Chapter 4: Monster Queen.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-4-monster-queen>#</a></h2><p>To find the outfits in Chapter 4, you should sell Groot to Lady Hellbender. Selling Rocket will create a new scenario that won’t allow you to sneak through his palace after midnight. If you jump in Chapter 4 from the main menu, you’ll sell Groot entirely.</p><h3 id=draxs-guardians-of-the-galaxy-outfit-is-coming-soon>Drax’s Guardians of the Galaxy outfit is coming soon.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#draxs-guardians-of-the-galaxy-outfit-is-coming-soon>#</a></h3><p>After wandering through the first wave of ill-wishers, the Guardians arrive in the Lady Hellbenders throne room. A new bridge is hidden outside the throne. Head over there and go left and find a Guardian of the Galaxy (Draxs) outfit tucked in the corner.</p><h3 id=five-horsemen-of-the-apocalypse-outfit-are-being-joined-by-rockets-the-lions-and-the-parachutes>Five Horsemen of the Apocalypse outfit are being joined by Rockets, the lions and the parachutes.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#five-horsemen-of-the-apocalypse-outfit-are-being-joined-by-rockets-the-lions-and-the-parachutes>#</a></h3><p>After riding the elevator down from the Lady Hellbenders throne room, the Guardians will have to sneak past other drunk Hellraisers. If you want to take the steps, turn left and hop over the table. You’ll have to sneak several hellraisers to find a wall you can crouch under. On the other side of this wall is the F-Hattle of the Apocalypse outfit.</p><h2 id=chapter-5-medicinals-or-sillations>Chapter 5: Medicinals or “Sillations”<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-5-medicinals-or-sillations>#</a></h2><p>With enough money to pay their fine, the Guardians head back to Nova Corps base to find it empty. The main benefit of this mission is to help Groot find a bathroom.</p><h3 id=draxs-nova-corp-outfit-reunited>Draxs Nova-Corp outfit reunited.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#draxs-nova-corp-outfit-reunited>#</a></h3><p>Before they get off to Milano, Groot asks if there’s a toilet at the Station Nova Corps. He met unanimously, holding it in. You’ll eventually come to a room where Star-Lord must use his visor to redirect electricity to the door. Reroute the power to the locked door on the left, revealing what Groots was looking for a bathroom. Head into the store, searching for Drax’s Nova Corps outfit. You must have opened the door. Opening the main door triggers rocket to leave the control room.</p><h3 id=groots-nova-corps-outfit-was-brought-together-by-groots>Groots Nova Corps outfit was brought together by Groots.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#groots-nova-corps-outfit-was-brought-together-by-groots>#</a></h3><p>Star-Lord eventually will take a helmet off and overhear a number of people talking on the opposite side. The right decision here is to bring down the helmet and not say anything. Nevertheless, the attacker has to fight his way out of the base. He eventually exited the town of a corrupted Nova Corps soldier. Once he has defeated himself, he will enter an orange-glowing room. There’s a lift, where you can jump and get out. Don’t leave yet. The Groots Nova Corps outfit is hidden behind a box on the opposite side of the room.</p><h2 id=chapter-6-between-rock-and-hard-place>Chapter 6: Between Rock and Hard Place.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-6-between-rock-and-hard-place>#</a></h2><p>Tensions are high when the Guardians arrive on Knowhere. Rocket and Groot left their head. Danrax and Gamora eventually left Star-Lord after talking to Mantis. Now alone, Star-Lord could either gamble all their credit away or go to find Cosmo. One outfit can be found while they travel to Knowhere.</p><h3 id=featured-stars-guardians-of-the-galaxy-2014-outfit>Featured Stars Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) outfit.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#featured-stars-guardians-of-the-galaxy-2014-outfit>#</a></h3><p>Start the aims when you find a small flight of stairs leading into a pink-laced building. This building is opposite the colorful slot machine. On the left side of the building, children would see a trio of children pointing at each other. If you have problems seeing them, turn off the subtitles and watch Pew-pew, pew-pew. Behind these children is a railing that you can jump on. This lead to a series of red pipes below. Walk left onto the pipes and find the Guardians of the Galaxy outfit by Star-Lord.</p><h2 id=chapter-7-canine-fusion-infusion>Chapter 7. Canine fusion: Infusion.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-7-canine-fusion-infusion>#</a></h2><p>The Russian Space Dog, Cosmo transports the Guardians to the ship of Nova Corps, to find out what happens. There are two outfits to find during this mission. You’ll use his shock elemental ammo to grab the outfit left behind during Chapter 2.</p><h3 id=a-team-of-nova-corps-of-rockets-is-an-outfit-of-the-nova-corps>A team of Nova Corps of Rockets is an outfit of the Nova Corps.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#a-team-of-nova-corps-of-rockets-is-an-outfit-of-the-nova-corps>#</a></h3><p>The Guardians are going to look at a circular elevator. As the elevator opens, you’ll need to blow off the enemies. After the second wave, Rocket will open two doors, and you’ll have to reroute your power so the elevator can move. From the point of view of Rockets, enter the left room to find his Nova Corps outfit. You can find a shaft through the way of Groot to raise the platform.</p><h3 id=gamoras-nova-outfit-has-a-military-presence>Gamoras Nova outfit has a military presence.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gamoras-nova-outfit-has-a-military-presence>#</a></h3><p>The Guardians will revisit Starlords steps in Chapter 2 to find a secret hideout in Nikkis. You descend stairs with a pool of electrified water at the bottom. The water’s power can be lost by using the Star-Lords shock ammo to recharge. You are watching a series of pipes Gamora can chop down with her sword. Stop trying these pipes so as to find the Gamoras Nova Corps outfit.</p><h2 id=the-matriarch-chapter-8-matriarch-who-will-be-the-matriarch>The Matriarch: Chapter 8: Matriarch: Who will be the matriarch?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-matriarch-chapter-8-matriarch-who-will-be-the-matriarch>#</a></h2><p>The first portion of the matriarch will be hard, if you are hunting. Without doubt you won’t need to redo the entire mission sequence from Star-Lords if you have already played through this mission. We have two outfits to find after your first encounter with The Matriarch (which we won’t spoil).</p><h3 id=stars-and-the-knights-in-bad-lord-outfit>Stars and the Knights in bad Lord outfit.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#stars-and-the-knights-in-bad-lord-outfit>#</a></h3><p>The Guardians dive into what Rocket thought to be toxic warp-drive fluid. They will sludge down a tunnel and emerge safely on the other side. There’s a big box adjacent to that can become used by Drax. Make her place it just outside the tunnel you are left. Call up and discover a hidden room with the Star-Lords’ bad-god outfit. We can’t believe that the other Guardians allow him to dress like this!</p><h3 id=draxs-cage-match-outfit>Draxs Cage Match outfit.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#draxs-cage-match-outfit>#</a></h3><p>You’ll descend to the elevator after a skiff sequence. Once the elevator stops, walk in to the back for a Draxs Cage match outfit.</p><h2 id=chapter-9-diversion>Chapter 9: Diversion.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-9-diversion>#</a></h2><p>Since you’ll spend all your time on the Milano mission, there are no outfits to find in Chapter nine of Guardians of the Galaxy.</p><h2 id=this-chapter-teaches-some-faith>This chapter teaches some faith.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#this-chapter-teaches-some-faith>#</a></h2><p>Drax needs help. There are the Guardians in there to rescue him from a chasm. To find the source of Draxs mind prison, they should however navigate the caves under Lamentis to locate the caves. There are three costumes on this mission.</p><h3 id=gamoras-five-horsemen-of-the-apocalypse-outfit-are-all-in-the-same-outfit>Gamoras, five Horsemen of the Apocalypse outfit are all in the same outfit.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gamoras-five-horsemen-of-the-apocalypse-outfit-are-all-in-the-same-outfit>#</a></h3><p>Mantis brings the guards into the huddle below Lamentis. They will take a crystal bridge and reach a shallow waterside. A pink box is visible behind the waterfall. Enter the cave behind the waterfall and try to find Gamoras Five Horsemen, of the apocalypse outfit.</p><h3 id=rockets-hero-of-halfworld-outfit>Rockets Hero of Halfworld outfit.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#rockets-hero-of-halfworld-outfit>#</a></h3><p>After a fending off the Ogrode, you are going to enter a further open area. On the left of the page, you will see a crack in the wall and a small hole in a rocket could crawl through. Hell blow the wallhole, making you one more way. Use a freeze ammo to reopen the poison gas which blocked your path. Next, please let Groot use the lift to take you to the base. The cave walked to the far side of the hill. Rockets is an American team.</p><h3 id=groots-enthusiastical-consecutive-for-enlightenment--the-ultimate-consequestor-in-famous-escalator>Groots enthusiastical consecutive for enlightenment – the ultimate consequestor-in-famous escalator.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#groots-enthusiastical-consecutive-for-enlightenment--the-ultimate-consequestor-in-famous-escalator>#</a></h3><p>When Groot led the Guardians through the dark cave, go into the right until you see a room lightened with purple light. Shimmy through the crack to get out of a Groots anscundation Conquest outfit.</p><h2 id=chapter-11-mind-and-matter-revelation-and-abrasia>Chapter 11, Mind and Matter, Revelation, and Abrasia.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-11-mind-and-matter-revelation-and-abrasia>#</a></h2><p>Since you spend the majority of this mission inside the head of Drax, there are no outfits that we can find in Chapter 11 of Guardians of the Galaxy.</p><h2 id=chapter-12--how-to-run-on-your-feet>Chapter 12 – How to Run on your feet!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-12--how-to-run-on-your-feet>#</a></h2><p>The guards arrive back on Knowhere, but it isn’t how they remember to leave it. Even bad Rockets favorite dive bar got destroyed in the invasion. There are five outfits in this chapter, some of which are available to you already if you ordered the game. If you have these outfits, you’ll find them instead.</p><h3 id=draxs-thanos-anamarroa-imperative-outfit>Draxs Thanos Anamarroa Imperative outfit.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#draxs-thanos-anamarroa-imperative-outfit>#</a></h3><p>Who preordered this game will have this outfit already. If you don’t yet, you will find it early in this chapter. Defeat the first wave of enemies from the beginning of that chapter. Drax pulls a yellow crate to make a jump point. Jump up on the platform, and try to find Draxs Thanos Imperative.</p><h3 id=rockets-smuggler-outfit>Rockets smuggler outfit<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#rockets-smuggler-outfit>#</a></h3><p>You’ll find a tight area to aspire to the Knowhere marketplace. Don’t go by yet. Turn left. If you can imagine that the creature is able to manipulate his wind ammo, turn right. Within an elevator is a Rockets smuggler.</p><h3 id=-in-the-bag-of-the-mp-he-carries-a-groots-boots>– In the bag of the mp, he carries a Groots boots.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-in-the-bag-of-the-mp-he-carries-a-groots-boots>#</a></h3><p>If you pre-order the match, they will have this outfit in your inventory. If not keep a close eye after Gamora cut off the wires to move forward. After she cut the wires and you find a wall for Drax to push aside, turn left. You’ll see a green bar from which Star-Lord can use his wind ammo on. The difference between the two sides is the malfunctioning door that Star-Lord can use to stop this.
Once the floor becomes clear, you will find a room. On your left is a shootable panel revealing a hole that could be buried by Rocket. When you turn the power off, you can cross quickly. In this room is Groots Optoler.</p><h3 id=gamoras-casual-kill-outfit>Gamoras Casual Kill outfit.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gamoras-casual-kill-outfit>#</a></h3><p>After you had the fight to get over the roofs, Drax will hit the nail. After sliding down the ramp, turn around for a second hole. The Gamoras Casual Kill outfit is on the other side.</p><h3 id=star-lords-apocalypse-lord-outfit>Star-Lords Apocalypse Lord outfit.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#star-lords-apocalypse-lord-outfit>#</a></h3><p>After fighting off the allies that inhabit the brains of the donut, you’ll eventually find an pillar that Drax can hold up and move. Place it where you have to and jump up to the catwalk. Go right and find a spot where Gamora can anchor. As soon as she gives you a boost, climb back to another walking street. Here there’s the outfit from the gods of the Stars.</p><h2 id=chapter-13-fighting-all-odds>Chapter 13: Fighting All Odds.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-13-fighting-all-odds>#</a></h2><p>After long discussion on the Milano issue announcing the settlement of the church, the Guardians finally came up with an objective plan for Fin Fang Foom. There are 4 outfits on this mission.</p><h3 id=gamoras-black-vortex-outfit-teamed-up-with-gamoras>Gamoras Black Vortex outfit teamed up with Gamoras.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gamoras-black-vortex-outfit-teamed-up-with-gamoras>#</a></h3><p>People who pre-ordered the game will now have this outfit. If you don’t believe that Gamora can make it after defeating the Mushigers. Before cutting through the ice, ask Gamora to join a wall to the right. Jump up to the next level and scooge across the gap to buy a Gamoras Black Vortex outfit.</p><h3 id=groots-five-ounce-oclock-sprout-suit>Groots five-ounce oclock Sprout suit.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#groots-five-ounce-oclock-sprout-suit>#</a></h3><p>Simplify the iceworms and build a bridge. You will shimmy on the wall and find the entrance to a cave. Groots Five OClock Sprouts outfit is on a path right after entering the cave.</p><h3 id=star-lords-war-lord-outfit>Star-Lords War-Lord outfit.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#star-lords-war-lord-outfit>#</a></h3><p>If you have linked Guardians of the Galaxy with their Square Enix account, you have already said that. If not, you’ll find it after unlocking the Fire Ammo for Star-Lords guns. Use fire hammer for melting ice and drops an item of the cave to fill the gap. Cross the gap and look into the left. You’ll see more snow and a platform coming to the boil. Allow Groot to raise the platform to the next level. There are any Star-Lords War-Lord outfits on here.</p><h3 id=rockets-stinger-outfit>Rockets Stinger outfit.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#rockets-stinger-outfit>#</a></h3><p>Those who pre-ordered the game will have this outfit already. If you don’t, make sure you notice that the poison plants are poisoned. Take the right to find another area with 4 plants. They are distinguishable if the stars are used as a visor (they will glow yellow). Shoot the plants to find the Rockets Stinger outfit behind them.</p><h3 id=draxs-katathian-shirts-outfit-with-the-monks>Drax’s Katathian shirts outfit with the Monks.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#draxs-katathian-shirts-outfit-with-the-monks>#</a></h3><p>After finding a burning village, you will slide down an ice tunnel. At the base of the tunnel, turn left and find a set of cliffs covered in poison plants. You must drive the plant while you stop. Look at the Draxs Katathian Monk outfit at the end of the cliffs.</p><h2 id=the-secret-what-is-in-a-fire>The Secret: What is In a Fire?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-secret-what-is-in-a-fire>#</a></h2><p>In this climax-centered chapter there are eight outfits to find. However, 5 of them (the Golden Guardians set) will unlock at the beginning. Aside from the subject of collecting cash, make sure that all of the collectibles are discussed with your fellow guards. This is the third time you’re in Milan ahead of the New Game Plus.</p><h3 id=the-golden-guardians-set-the-ball-in-their-wings>The Golden Guardians set the ball in their wings.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-golden-guardians-set-the-ball-in-their-wings>#</a></h3><p>To save you a little money, you’ll unlock every Guardian’s Golden outfit. They will do this mission, apparently looking for courage to die. They’re Star-Lords Gold-Lord outfits and Drax, Gamora, Rocket and Groots Golden Guardians outfits.</p><h3 id=star-lords-team-lord-outfit>Star-Lords team-Lord outfit.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#star-lords-team-lord-outfit>#</a></h3><p>Those who pre-ordered the game will now have this outfit. Always check out your progress when you enter the hallway with the large fan. You will use an elemental jumper to stop the wind from hitting you in the pit.
You’ll eventually climb one platform at the end of this area. When you are seated on the highest platform, take the look over the tunnel to look for an outfit box. If the wind stops blowing, leap over the gap, leading to victory for the Star-Lords Team-Lord outfit.</p><h3 id=draxs-five-legged-group-from-apocalypse-dodgypse-were-the-draxs-apocalypse-outfit>Draxs five-legged group from Apocalypse dodgypse were the draxs-apocalypse outfit.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#draxs-five-legged-group-from-apocalypse-dodgypse-were-the-draxs-apocalypse-outfit>#</a></h3><p>You’ll be out of the ship and fight through a bunch of enemies in order to find this outfit. You’ll jump between two platforms before Groot becomes an extension of the next space. To cross the bridge on the other side, look right. Youll see the outfit box on an elevated platform. Keep your ammo to melt a wall revealing a tight space you could squeeze through. Head left, climb up the platform and claim Draxs Five Horsemen of the Apocalypse Outfit, so that the set completed.</p><h3 id=gamoras-chosen-daughter-outfit>Gamoras Chosen Daughter outfit.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#gamoras-chosen-daughter-outfit>#</a></h3><p>You will enter a mining area where Star-Lord needs to use his guns to freeze some geysers. Look to your left for three more geysers after freezing the second geyser. Freeze all three of them and jump across. The final plate is breaking in the wall which you can squeeze through. Inside, there is a costume from the Gamoras Chosen Daughter.</p><h2 id=chapter-15-broken-promises>Chapter 15: Broken Promises.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#chapter-15-broken-promises>#</a></h2><p>There are no outfits found in Chapter 15 of Guardians of the Galaxy. Just enjoy the epilogue. However, once the game has finished and you begin New Game Plus, you will unlock two new outfits for Star-Lord. These are his Space-Lord and Sleek-Lord outfits. You can take those outfits off the menus in your new game.
