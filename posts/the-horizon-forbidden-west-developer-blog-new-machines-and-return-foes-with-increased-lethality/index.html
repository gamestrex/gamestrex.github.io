The world of Horizon is inhabited by highly advanced robots that have become the world’s dominant species. Each skeleton comes in different sizes, and on different life forms that have existed in the earliest times of history, such as dinosaurs, prehistoric mammals and birds. They are not frightened, but ferocious, and are incompatible with Aloys mission. Please note that this article has some spoilers for Horizon Zero Dawn and its storyline. Some of the machines encountered during the events of Horizon Zero Dawn will be present in the upcoming sequel, Horizon Forbidden West. The Watcher, for example, rarely uses a small theropod for machinery and often patrol large theherds with potential threats. Or the crocodile-like beast, which was created in the wake of the war to purify water and become feral. In the multiplayer trailer Horizon Forbidden West, Aloy encounters some of them: the fast and agile Clawstrider and the deadly mammoth-like Tremortusk. Of course there will be many more machines to fight or mount, therefore, Aloyand you should be prepared for any situation in those forsaken lands. These swivel metal beasts delight in the world. In the early years of Horizon Zero Dawn, Principal Machine Designer Blake Politeski worked with Guerrilla. Together with Asset Art Chief Maxim Fleury, their teams (and others) have been working on some great additions for the coming sequel. We were going to explore a new area in the world of Horizon, begins Blake. It was interesting to find out which types of machines would live in different ecological zones and how they would interact with each other, their environment, and of course humans. Machines are so-called caretakers of the world, so it’s always interesting to see how they perform their roles and what the player can do to protect them from these behaviors. In the initial stages of Horizon Zero Dawns, we had some wonderful ideas, of course not everything would play. But now with Horizon Forbidden West we could share one-two, exciting ideas that previously weren’t feasible in new and interesting concepts! Maxim elaborates: Blakes team provides a design document for our general looks, explains what type of equipment the machine has, and what kind of damage it can do. I have two sets of drawings and one sets of drawings, yet, the real visual design is moved from the Robotics team to the Weapons Project team. Concept Artists then create a 3-D concept which goes through many reviews, through which various art direction, game design, animation, and technical art teams will be created, till all are happy. Look, rig, and animate a model to see if everything works as needed, and the modelers on the robotic team will work on it, adding all the details in. After several iterations with different teams, the model is animated, painted, textured, and reviewed again before becoming added to the game, and replaces the temporary model. The process for the development of each machine takes a long time. Expanding the Machine Catalog. With over 25 different machines in Horizon Zero Dawn, finishing them was never easy. I started small, and began to define different roles in the first game, says Blake. The Watcher is like a security camera; the Ravager is an enforcer, and so forth. Once those base roles were established, we were able to build on that by mixing in robot designs, unique capabilities and features, and of course cool weapons and attacks. We’re expanding this catalog further with Horizon Forbidden West. For example, we knew we wanted a slightly bigger flying machine than the Glinthawk, which resulted in the Sunwing but it needed a place and a role in the world. The idea to see the planet when its floats and primitive birds were formed was created using the thought of collecting solar energy during a sunny season. This then created an interesting gameplay dynamic: Sunwings are vulnerable when they harvest solar energy, but also more alert to potential predators when they are idle. There are certain things that come into play, as well as the tools we have to define. We always want to ensure that the machines are connected, and that they serve a different purpose. Therefore, the whole machines (eco-system) is identical to the real world. Guerrilla always wanted to create a genuine world. This includes constructing real machines in the surrounding world. I don’t think that the design language from Horizon Zero Dawn has changed greatly for us, explains Maxim. As well as changing our machines, we are trying to take advantage of different equipment that make the world awe-inquire for our players. The machines in Horizon Forbidden West feature much more functionality this time around, is a challenge from a design perspective, but has a chance of making a unique experience for the player during a different encounter. New and dangerous Foes. In an earlier blog we discussed some of Aloys’s abilities and combat moves that she learns in the Forbidden West. Some will probably come in handy against stronger, faster and deadlier machines. Aloy has many different weapons and ammunition, and she will need all of them to beat the different machines! Without spoiling something, every machine has many ways to win. We tried the machine design to make players feel clear, and we added textures to show the weak points or the interactive components. You must closely study each machine so that you can find different ways to approach it. Blake adds: A lot of machines have various weapons and behaviors that can be used for a benefit. This isn’t just in shooting off parts and using them, it’s also possible that some machines have more passive states, where the player can sway their opponent. A plant is a field-made product that gets a little dirt for a while. The machines that use Horizon Forbidden West are more easily used, even if the idea is to swim, then cling to surfaces. Because of this, Aloy will have to keep up with it, so there are new movement mechanics that help her out. Were focusing more on Aloys’ ability to survey and plan an encounter before engaging, as well as her ability to escape if things don’t go as planned. In the machine battle, actions like climbing or using a Smoke Bomb can give Aloy an edge, but more importantly, players can use a system that improved both well and well. People living in the Forbidden West are more dangerous, but players can understand their behavior and predict their movements through an audiometric instrument. One machine might have several sounds for idling, alerting others, and initiating attacks. The PlayStation 5 game will become the real world where it can be made possible by 3D audio, in addition to 3D software, providing an amazing situational awareness amongst a vast world of players, with the use of analog or USB headphones. Meet the treasurer. In the trailer to the Tale of The Devil, Aloy goes head-to-head with one of the biggest foes we’ve seen so far: the Tremortusk. The vantage point is a real sight to see, but it is hard to defeat it. The Tremortusk is a rich heritage and richness at present. There are a lot of attacks, with various weapons covered. Apart from using its tusks to close attacks, he has also different elemental weapons. The trailer you see was controlled by a rebel group of the Tenakth, but you can also find them wandering wilds, explained Maxim. In the 1960s, a huge siege tower was used for the attack of fortresses and war elephants; hard to destroy, slow, and high firepower is still scarce. It inspired the idea for the Tremortusk, a well-armed, but slow machine, with an unstoppable force. In the West Horizons, enemies can control machines, so it seemed natural if they had blended the two and decided based on war elephants, with a platform from which the humans can fire at Aloy from. Once you return to the machine, you had the effect on keeping a balance on Earth and making sure that no one could wipe out life again. Tremortusks were created for combat machines, and protecting other machines against human interference, so they can do everything they want to do without humans. Both Blake and Maxim agree that the Tremortusk is one of the most formidable enemies in the game and requires quite a bit of preparation to defeat the game: we recommend using traps and a pullcaster. While slow, they can reach speed that will easily trample Aloy, so make it hard for you to dodge. Be careful, last, of its flamethrower trunk. Turn the rope off with an Override! While almost every machine is afraid of a fight, they also make great contribution to the world of Horizon or offer help to Aloy throughout her journey. Think of Tallnecks. They’re not hostile and are, in fact, in fact, giving Aloy a bit of clarity and direction when overridden. Aloy can, that’s the equivalent of Horizon Zero Dawn, override machines and have them fight with her, says Maxim. We added many more wheels that you can see in the game’s trailer. Blake adds: Some machines may also inadvertently help Aloy out. If a machine is looking for something from Aloy, they can rely on it to stashes. By controlling the shaming and enforcing, Aloy now has some control over the machine behavior, shifting them into defensive states. One of the things everyone at Guerrilla is eagerly anticipating is getting to know which new machines players will like. Of course, we have our own machine in the studio; he prefers the Thunderjaw for Maxim. I saw a concept from Horizon Zero Dawn for the first time. As always, it was a very important idea for me. I like the design and character of it. In contrast, in Western Horizon, its the Burrowers: nifty little machines that can overwhelm you if you aren’t careful. And her favorite singer? The Stormbird is there. It’s one of the first ones we designed. We’re trying to figure out what these machines would be. When I pitched that to a friend, it was like an eagle combined with a fighter jet. However, it would be elemental with a surge in electricity to high from the sky. It would hit the ground directly to the player with a lightning bolt and explode! Our Game Director heard this conversation. Turn around, and said it sounds great! We finally decided to make the Stormbird look beautiful. For me, my favorite is always the Shellsnapper. It’s a machine that had been brewing in my mind since the first game. I am excited to see it in the Forbidden West. It is big and has quite a wide range of abilities that will encourage play-players to build upon inspiration from films, real life, and to the odd things that we have come up with ourselves. I’m as excited as to see people reacting to this machine. Horizon Forbidden West will run for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.\ntitle: “The Horizon Forbidden West Developer Blog New Machines And Return Foes With Increased Lethality” ShowToc: true date: “2022-12-15” author: “Jeffrey Quigley” Get the full post below.

Machines are so-called caretakers of the world, so it’s always interesting to see how they perform their roles and what the player can do to protect them from these behaviors.
In the initial stages of Horizon Zero Dawns, we had some wonderful ideas, of course not everything would play. But now with Horizon Forbidden West we could share one-two, exciting ideas that previously weren’t feasible in new and interesting concepts!
Maxim elaborates: Blakes team provides a design document for our general looks, explains what type of equipment the machine has, and what kind of damage it can do. I have two sets of drawings and one sets of drawings, yet, the real visual design is moved from the Robotics team to the Weapons Project team.
Concept Artists then create a 3-D concept which goes through many reviews, through which various art direction, game design, animation, and technical art teams will be created, till all are happy. Look, rig, and animate a model to see if everything works as needed, and the modelers on the robotic team will work on it, adding all the details in. After several iterations with different teams, the model is animated, painted, textured, and reviewed again before becoming added to the game, and replaces the temporary model. The process for the development of each machine takes a long time.
Expanding the Machine Catalog.
With over 25 different machines in Horizon Zero Dawn, finishing them was never easy. I started small, and began to define different roles in the first game, says Blake. The Watcher is like a security camera; the Ravager is an enforcer, and so forth. Once those base roles were established, we were able to build on that by mixing in robot designs, unique capabilities and features, and of course cool weapons and attacks.
We’re expanding this catalog further with Horizon Forbidden West. For example, we knew we wanted a slightly bigger flying machine than the Glinthawk, which resulted in the Sunwing but it needed a place and a role in the world. The idea to see the planet when its floats and primitive birds were formed was created using the thought of collecting solar energy during a sunny season. This then created an interesting gameplay dynamic: Sunwings are vulnerable when they harvest solar energy, but also more alert to potential predators when they are idle.
There are certain things that come into play, as well as the tools we have to define. We always want to ensure that the machines are connected, and that they serve a different purpose. Therefore, the whole machines (eco-system) is identical to the real world.
Guerrilla always wanted to create a genuine world. This includes constructing real machines in the surrounding world. I don’t think that the design language from Horizon Zero Dawn has changed greatly for us, explains Maxim. As well as changing our machines, we are trying to take advantage of different equipment that make the world awe-inquire for our players. The machines in Horizon Forbidden West feature much more functionality this time around, is a challenge from a design perspective, but has a chance of making a unique experience for the player during a different encounter.
New and dangerous Foes.
In an earlier blog we discussed some of Aloys’s abilities and combat moves that she learns in the Forbidden West. Some will probably come in handy against stronger, faster and deadlier machines.
Aloy has many different weapons and ammunition, and she will need all of them to beat the different machines! Without spoiling something, every machine has many ways to win. We tried the machine design to make players feel clear, and we added textures to show the weak points or the interactive components. You must closely study each machine so that you can find different ways to approach it.
Blake adds: A lot of machines have various weapons and behaviors that can be used for a benefit. This isn’t just in shooting off parts and using them, it’s also possible that some machines have more passive states, where the player can sway their opponent. A plant is a field-made product that gets a little dirt for a while.
The machines that use Horizon Forbidden West are more easily used, even if the idea is to swim, then cling to surfaces. Because of this, Aloy will have to keep up with it, so there are new movement mechanics that help her out. Were focusing more on Aloys’ ability to survey and plan an encounter before engaging, as well as her ability to escape if things don’t go as planned.
In the machine battle, actions like climbing or using a Smoke Bomb can give Aloy an edge, but more importantly, players can use a system that improved both well and well. People living in the Forbidden West are more dangerous, but players can understand their behavior and predict their movements through an audiometric instrument. One machine might have several sounds for idling, alerting others, and initiating attacks. The PlayStation 5 game will become the real world where it can be made possible by 3D audio, in addition to 3D software, providing an amazing situational awareness amongst a vast world of players, with the use of analog or USB headphones.
Meet the treasurer.
In the trailer to the Tale of The Devil, Aloy goes head-to-head with one of the biggest foes we’ve seen so far: the Tremortusk. The vantage point is a real sight to see, but it is hard to defeat it.
The Tremortusk is a rich heritage and richness at present. There are a lot of attacks, with various weapons covered. Apart from using its tusks to close attacks, he has also different elemental weapons. The trailer you see was controlled by a rebel group of the Tenakth, but you can also find them wandering wilds, explained Maxim.
In the 1960s, a huge siege tower was used for the attack of fortresses and war elephants; hard to destroy, slow, and high firepower is still scarce. It inspired the idea for the Tremortusk, a well-armed, but slow machine, with an unstoppable force. In the West Horizons, enemies can control machines, so it seemed natural if they had blended the two and decided based on war elephants, with a platform from which the humans can fire at Aloy from.
Once you return to the machine, you had the effect on keeping a balance on Earth and making sure that no one could wipe out life again. Tremortusks were created for combat machines, and protecting other machines against human interference, so they can do everything they want to do without humans.
Both Blake and Maxim agree that the Tremortusk is one of the most formidable enemies in the game and requires quite a bit of preparation to defeat the game: we recommend using traps and a pullcaster. While slow, they can reach speed that will easily trample Aloy, so make it hard for you to dodge. Be careful, last, of its flamethrower trunk.
Turn the rope off with an Override!
While almost every machine is afraid of a fight, they also make great contribution to the world of Horizon or offer help to Aloy throughout her journey. Think of Tallnecks. They’re not hostile and are, in fact, in fact, giving Aloy a bit of clarity and direction when overridden.
Aloy can, that’s the equivalent of Horizon Zero Dawn, override machines and have them fight with her, says Maxim. We added many more wheels that you can see in the game’s trailer.
Blake adds: Some machines may also inadvertently help Aloy out. If a machine is looking for something from Aloy, they can rely on it to stashes. By controlling the shaming and enforcing, Aloy now has some control over the machine behavior, shifting them into defensive states.
One of the things everyone at Guerrilla is eagerly anticipating is getting to know which new machines players will like. Of course, we have our own machine in the studio; he prefers the Thunderjaw for Maxim.
I saw a concept from Horizon Zero Dawn for the first time. As always, it was a very important idea for me. I like the design and character of it. In contrast, in Western Horizon, its the Burrowers: nifty little machines that can overwhelm you if you aren’t careful.
And her favorite singer? The Stormbird is there. It’s one of the first ones we designed. We’re trying to figure out what these machines would be. When I pitched that to a friend, it was like an eagle combined with a fighter jet. However, it would be elemental with a surge in electricity to high from the sky. It would hit the ground directly to the player with a lightning bolt and explode! Our Game Director heard this conversation. Turn around, and said it sounds great! We finally decided to make the Stormbird look beautiful.
For me, my favorite is always the Shellsnapper. It’s a machine that had been brewing in my mind since the first game. I am excited to see it in the Forbidden West. It is big and has quite a wide range of abilities that will encourage play-players to build upon inspiration from films, real life, and to the odd things that we have come up with ourselves. I’m as excited as to see people reacting to this machine.

The world of Horizon is inhabited by highly advanced robots that have become the world’s dominant species. Each skeleton comes in different sizes, and on different life forms that have existed in the earliest times of history, such as dinosaurs, prehistoric mammals and birds. They are not frightened, but ferocious, and are incompatible with Aloys mission.
Please note that this article has some spoilers for Horizon Zero Dawn and its storyline.
Some of the machines encountered during the events of Horizon Zero Dawn will be present in the upcoming sequel, Horizon Forbidden West. The Watcher, for example, rarely uses a small theropod for machinery and often patrol large theherds with potential threats. Or the crocodile-like beast, which was created in the wake of the war to purify water and become feral.
In the multiplayer trailer Horizon Forbidden West, Aloy encounters some of them: the fast and agile Clawstrider and the deadly mammoth-like Tremortusk. Of course there will be many more machines to fight or mount, therefore, Aloyand you should be prepared for any situation in those forsaken lands.
These swivel metal beasts delight in the world.
In the early years of Horizon Zero Dawn, Principal Machine Designer Blake Politeski worked with Guerrilla. Together with Asset Art Chief Maxim Fleury, their teams (and others) have been working on some great additions for the coming sequel.
