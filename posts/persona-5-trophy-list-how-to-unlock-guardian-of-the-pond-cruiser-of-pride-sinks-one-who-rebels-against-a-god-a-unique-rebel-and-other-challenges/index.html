I Am Thou - Obtain a Persona through negotiation. This will happen automatically during your exploration of Kaneshiro’s Palace. Countless Masks - Obtain 30 Personas through negotiation. Getting the Sun Arcana to Rank 8 can make this a lot easier as it gives you a chance of automatically winning negotiations. The Sneaking One - Ambush the enemy 50 times. You’ll unlock this over the course of natural play, but if you’re struggling, use your environment to hide and approach suddenly when their back is turned. A Unique Rebel - Defeat the Reaper. This shadow shows up if you spend too long on a single floor in Mementos, is more than capable of one-shotting you, and under normal circumstances is invulnerable.The only way to defeat him is to visit Mementos during flu season, wait for him to show up, then guard and heal your way through a few rounds of combat and he’ll keel over and die of his own accord. Drink Fanatic - Buy every kind of drink from vending machines. This is best done before August as once the weather heats up the machines are usually out of stock.The locations of the machines are marked on your map, and they’re restocked on Mondays so it’s worth having a quick run around once a week, not only for the trophy, but because they’re the main source of SP-replenishing items.

Competent Negotiator - Successfully rescue a hostage from an enemy’s threat. This requires luck, and is easier to achieve on higher difficulty levels.Occasionally if a shadow gets a critical or elemental weakness strike in on one of your party they will be taken hostage and the enemy will attempt to negotiate terms. If you’ve got network features on you can get the hostage back for free, but if you’re offline it may cost you an item. Skilled Gunman - Defeat 3 or more enemies at once with a single round of bullets. Weaken a group of enemies so they only have a few HP each, and then finish them off with gunfire. Beginner Phantom Thieves - Complete 5 requests. Our Momentos article can help discuss how this system works. A Perfect Job - Complete all requests.

This must be completed on or before December 22nd. My Backyard - Unlock all hangout spots.

Guardian of the Pond - Catch the Guardian of the fishing pond. Read Fishpond Spotter and Essence of Fishing, and then earn enough fishing points to buy the top-tier bait - fishing at night and upgrading to better bait when you can afford it can speed this up.Once you’ve got the bait you need to catch another six fish with it to trigger the Guardian - try to hook him when he’s near the surface otherwise he’s highly likely to escape. Aggressive Searcher - Obtain 150 items from searchable objects in Palaces. You’ll unlock this over the course of natural play. Under-the-Table Goods - Customize a gun. Requires starting the Hanged Man Arcana (Iwai in Untouchables.) Craftworker - Create all types of infiltration tools.

Ingredients for crafting can be purchased from various shops around the overworld and will be randomly dropped when defeating shadows.Getting Kawakami to rank 5 will occasionally allow you to craft items during school hours, and at rank 7 you can ask her to craft items for you, both of which can save you precious time.\nNeed more help?

One Who Rebels Against a God - Create Satanael. Only available in NG+. Satanael is a level 95 Persona, so some grinding may be involved - maxing out the Strength Arcana will allow you to summon Personas beyond your own level, but it can be very expensive.To fuse him you’ll need to combine Arsene, Ishtar, Anzu, Hiero, Lucifer, and Michael in a Group Guillotine. Golden Finger - Complete all video games. Once you’ve gained access to Akihabara buy a TV and games console from the second hand store in Yongenjaya, then buy the entire stock of games from the Retro shop in Akihabara.Reading the Game Secrets book from Shinjuku bookstore makes the games easier to complete, and it’s worth saving before each attempt as some of them can fail randomly. The City’s Hard Hitter - Hit a home run at the batting cages. Position your bat slightly below where the ball is due to appear, and this should be easy. Castle of Lust Falls - Complete the Castle Palace. Museum of Vanity Closes - Complete the Museum Palace. Bank of Gluttony Goes Bankrupt - Complete the Bank Palace. Pyramid of Wrath Collapses - Complete the Pyramid Palace. Spaceport of Greed Destroyed - Complete the Spaceport Palace. Casino of Jealousy Shut Down - Complete the Casino Palace. Cruiser of Pride Sinks - Complete the Cruiser Palace. Beyond Rehabilitation - Defeat the twins. This can only be obtained in NG+. Once you’ve been introduced to Mementos during your second playthrough, head to any Velvet Door and speak to Caroline outside and she’ll challenge you to show what you’re made of.Like most bosses they have no strengths or weaknesses so pick your strongest squad, and make sure you have no elements that your entire party is vulnerable to as they will one-shot you if they knock everyone down at once.
